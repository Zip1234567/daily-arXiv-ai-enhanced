### [2] [Self-Consistency in Vision-Language Models for Precision Agriculture: Multi-Response Consensus for Crop Disease Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08024)
*Mihir Gupta,Abhay Mangla,Ross Greer,Pratik Desai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合提示专家评估和自一致性机制的农业图像处理框架，显著提升了玉米叶病识别的准确性和治疗建议效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在农业领域表现不佳，需要更可靠的图像分析方法以支持精准农业。

Method: 1) 基于提示的专家评估协议；2) 余弦一致性自投票机制。

Result: 诊断准确率从82.2%提升至87.8%，症状分析从38.9%提升至52.2%，治疗建议从27.8%提升至43.3%。

Conclusion: 该方法在资源受限环境中具有实际应用潜力，支持实时农业决策。

Abstract: Precision agriculture relies heavily on accurate image analysis for crop
disease identification and treatment recommendation, yet existing
vision-language models (VLMs) often underperform in specialized agricultural
domains. This work presents a domain-aware framework for agricultural image
processing that combines prompt-based expert evaluation with self-consistency
mechanisms to enhance VLM reliability in precision agriculture applications. We
introduce two key innovations: (1) a prompt-based evaluation protocol that
configures a language model as an expert plant pathologist for scalable
assessment of image analysis outputs, and (2) a cosine-consistency self-voting
mechanism that generates multiple candidate responses from agricultural images
and selects the most semantically coherent diagnosis using domain-adapted
embeddings. Applied to maize leaf disease identification from field images
using a fine-tuned PaliGemma model, our approach improves diagnostic accuracy
from 82.2\% to 87.8\%, symptom analysis from 38.9\% to 52.2\%, and treatment
recommendation from 27.8\% to 43.3\% compared to standard greedy decoding. The
system remains compact enough for deployment on mobile devices, supporting
real-time agricultural decision-making in resource-constrained environments.
These results demonstrate significant potential for AI-driven precision
agriculture tools that can operate reliably in diverse field conditions.

### [4] [Towards Evaluating Robustness of Prompt Adherence in Text to Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08039)
*Sujith Vemishetty,Advitiya Arora,Anupama Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个评估文本到图像模型的新框架，重点关注其对提示的遵循能力，并通过实验发现现有模型在生成简单二元图像时表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态LLM和文本到图像模型的研究相对不足，其可靠性和性能评估缺乏系统化方法，因此需要建立全面的评估框架。

Method: 创建新数据集评估模型鲁棒性，利用GPT-4生成文本描述作为基准，通过比较生成图像与基准描述的一致性来评估模型性能。

Result: 实验表明，模型在生成仅包含两个变化因素的简单二元图像时表现不佳，且无法遵循输入数据集的分布。

Conclusion: 现有文本到图像模型在遵循提示和生成一致性图像方面存在显著不足，需进一步改进。

Abstract: The advancements in the domain of LLMs in recent years have surprised many,
showcasing their remarkable capabilities and diverse applications. Their
potential applications in various real-world scenarios have led to significant
research on their reliability and effectiveness. On the other hand, multimodal
LLMs and Text-to-Image models have only recently gained prominence, especially
when compared to text-only LLMs. Their reliability remains constrained due to
insufficient research on assessing their performance and robustness. This paper
aims to establish a comprehensive evaluation framework for Text-to-Image
models, concentrating particularly on their adherence to prompts. We created a
novel dataset that aimed to assess the robustness of these models in generating
images that conform to the specified factors of variation in the input text
prompts. Our evaluation studies present findings on three variants of Stable
Diffusion models: Stable Diffusion 3 Medium, Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large, and
Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large Turbo, and two variants of Janus models: Janus Pro
1B and Janus Pro 7B. We introduce a pipeline that leverages text descriptions
generated by the gpt-4o model for our ground-truth images, which are then used
to generate artificial images by passing these descriptions to the
Text-to-Image models. We then pass these generated images again through gpt-4o
using the same system prompt and compare the variation between the two
descriptions. Our results reveal that these models struggle to create simple
binary images with only two factors of variation: a simple geometric shape and
its location. We also show, using pre-trained VAEs on our dataset, that they
fail to generate images that follow our input dataset distribution.

### [5] [ConsNoTrainLoRA: Data-driven Weight Initialization of Low-rank Adapters using Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08044)
*Debasmit Das,Hyoungwoo Park,Munawar Hayat,Seokeon Choi,Sungrack Yun,Fatih Porikli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种数据驱动的LoRA权重初始化方法CNTLoRA，通过预训练权重和微调激活向量的约束关系，无需训练即可初始化LoRA权重，显著提升了收敛速度和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LoRA权重矩阵随机初始化且固定秩，限制了性能提升。论文旨在通过数据驱动的初始化方法改进LoRA的收敛和最终表现。

Method: 将LoRA初始化视为域偏移问题，利用预训练和微调激活的约束关系，推导出闭式解初始化LoRA权重，并支持可变秩分解。

Result: 在图像生成、分类和理解等任务中，CNTLoRA在定量和定性上均优于标准及数据驱动的初始化方法。

Conclusion: CNTLoRA通过优化初始化策略，实现了更快的收敛和更高的性能，为LoRA微调提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Foundation models are pre-trained on large-scale datasets and subsequently
fine-tuned on small-scale datasets using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
techniques like low-rank adapters (LoRA). In most previous works, LoRA weight
matrices are randomly initialized with a fixed rank across all attachment
points. In this paper, we improve convergence and final performance of LoRA
fine-tuning, using our proposed data-driven weight initialization method,
ConsNoTrainLoRA (CNTLoRA). We express LoRA initialization as a domain shift
problem where we use multiple constraints relating the pre-training and
fine-tuning activations. By reformulating these constraints, we obtain a
closed-form estimate of LoRA weights that depends on pre-training weights and
fine-tuning activation vectors and hence requires no training during
initialization. This weight estimate is decomposed to initialize the up and
down matrices with proposed flexibility of variable ranks. With the proposed
initialization method, we fine-tune on downstream tasks such as image
generation, image classification and image understanding. Both quantitative and
qualitative results demonstrate that CNTLoRA outperforms standard and
data-driven weight initialization methods. Extensive analyses and ablations
further elucidate the design choices of our framework, providing an optimal
recipe for faster convergence and enhanced performance.

### [6] [A Hybrid Multilayer Extreme Learning Machine for Image Classification with an Application to Quadcopters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08047)
*Rolando A. Hernandez-Hernandez,Adrian Rubio-Solis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于ELM-AE和区间类型2模糊逻辑的混合多层极限学习机（HML-ELM），用于无人机图像分类，表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多层极限学习机（ML-ELM）及其变体在自然信号分类中表现良好，但需要更高效的方法用于无人机图像分类。

Method: HML-ELM分为两阶段：1）自学习特征提取（通过堆叠ELM-AE）；2）监督特征分类（使用改进的SIT2-FELM）。

Result: 实验表明，HML-ELM在图像分类和无人机任务中表现优于ML-ELM、ML-FELM和ELM。

Conclusion: HML-ELM是一种高效的图像分类方法，适用于无人机应用。

Abstract: Multilayer Extreme Learning Machine (ML-ELM) and its variants have proven to
be an effective technique for the classification of different natural signals
such as audio, video, acoustic and images. In this paper, a Hybrid Multilayer
Extreme Learning Machine (HML-ELM) that is based on ELM-based autoencoder
(ELM-AE) and an Interval Type-2 fuzzy Logic theory is suggested for active
image classification and applied to Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The
proposed methodology is a hierarchical ELM learning framework that consists of
two main phases: 1) self-taught feature extraction and 2) supervised feature
classification. First, unsupervised multilayer feature encoding is achieved by
stacking a number of ELM-AEs, in which input data is projected into a number of
high-level representations. At the second phase, the final features are
classified using a novel Simplified Interval Type-2 Fuzzy ELM (SIT2-FELM) with
a fast output reduction layer based on the SC algorithm; an improved version of
the algorithm Center of Sets Type Reducer without Sorting Requirement
(COSTRWSR). To validate the efficiency of the HML-ELM, two types of experiments
for the classification of images are suggested. First, the HML-ELM is applied
to solve a number of benchmark problems for image classification. Secondly, a
number of real experiments to the active classification and transport of four
different objects between two predefined locations using a UAV is implemented.
Experiments demonstrate that the proposed HML-ELM delivers a superior
efficiency compared to other similar methodologies such as ML-ELM, Multilayer
Fuzzy Extreme Learning Machine (ML-FELM) and ELM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 云和云影掩模是高光谱卫星成像的关键预处理步骤，需要高效且准确的模型来提取高质量数据。

Abstract: Cloud and cloud shadow masking is a crucial preprocessing step in
hyperspectral satellite imaging, enabling the extraction of high-quality,
analysis-ready data. This study evaluates various machine learning approaches,
including gradient boosting methods such as XGBoost and LightGBM as well as
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). All boosting and CNN models achieved
accuracies exceeding 93%. Among the investigated models, the CNN with feature
reduction emerged as the most efficient, offering a balance of high accuracy,
low storage requirements, and rapid inference times on both CPUs and GPUs.
Variations of this version, with only up to 597 trainable parameters,
demonstrated the best trade-off in terms of deployment feasibility, accuracy,
and computational efficiency. These results demonstrate the potential of
lightweight artificial intelligence (AI) models for real-time hyperspectral
image processing, supporting the development of on-board satellite AI systems
for space-based applications.

### [8] [The relative importance of being Gaussian](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08059)
*F. Alberto Grünbaum,Tondgi Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文探讨了在去噪算法中使用非高斯噪声（如均匀分布或Beta分布）的性能表现，而非修改算法以适应噪声类型。实验在小型设备上进行，结果对算法在不同噪声条件下的表现提出了挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在去噪算法中使用非高斯噪声的性能，而非调整算法以适应噪声类型，以探索算法的鲁棒性。

Method: 使用均匀分布、Beta分布或高斯混合噪声替代原始的高斯噪声，并在小型设备上运行算法进行实验。

Result: 实验结果表明，算法在非高斯噪声条件下的性能表现与高斯噪声条件下存在差异，具体表现仍需进一步验证。

Conclusion: 本文提出了在非高斯噪声条件下使用去噪算法的可能性，并指出在不同情境下验证这些观察的重要性。

Abstract: The remarkable results for denoising in computer vision using diffusion
models given in \cite{SDWMG,HJA,HHG} yield a robust mathematical justification
for algorithms based on crucial properties of a sequence of Gaussian
independent $N(0,1)$ random variables. In particular the derivations use the
fact that a Gaussian distribution is determined by its mean and variance and
that the sum of two Gaussians is another Gaussian.
  \bigskip
  The issue raised in this short note is the following: suppose we use the
algorithm without any changes but replace the nature of the noise and use, for
instance, uniformly distributed noise or noise with a Beta distribution, or
noise which is a random superposition of two Gaussians with very different
variances. One could, of course, try to modify the algorithm keeping in mind
the nature of the noise, but this is not what we do. Instead we study the
performance of the algorithm when used with noise that is very far in nature
from the Gaussian case, where it is designed to work well.
  Usually these algorithms are implemented on very powerful computers. Our
experiments are all carried out on a small laptop and for the smallest possible
image size. Exploring how our observations are confirmed or changed when
dealing in different situations remains an interesting challenge.

### [9] [An Object-Based Deep Learning Approach for Building Height Estimation from Single SAR Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08096)
*Babak Memar,Luigi Russo,Silvia Liberata Ullo,Paolo Gamba*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于深度学习的自动化方法，利用单张高分辨率SAR图像估计建筑物高度，并在多大陆数据集上验证了其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率SAR图像在建筑物高度估计中的应用需求迫切，尤其是在跨城市和跨大陆的泛化能力方面。

Method: 采用基于边界框检测和目标回归的深度学习模型，通过交叉验证评估模型的泛化能力。

Result: 模型在欧洲城市表现优异（如慕尼黑的MAE为2.20米），但在亚洲等高楼密集区域泛化能力有所下降。

Conclusion: 深度学习在单张SAR图像的建筑物高度估计中具有显著潜力，尤其是在跨城市和跨大陆的迁移学习方面。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of building heights using very high resolution (VHR)
synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is crucial for various urban
applications. This paper introduces a Deep Learning (DL)-based methodology for
automated building height estimation from single VHR COSMO-SkyMed images: an
object-based regression approach based on bounding box detection followed by
height estimation. This model was trained and evaluated on a unique
multi-continental dataset comprising eight geographically diverse cities across
Europe, North and South America, and Asia, employing a cross-validation
strategy to explicitly assess out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. The
results demonstrate highly promising performance, particularly on European
cities where the model achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of approximately
one building story (2.20 m in Munich), significantly outperforming recent
state-of-the-art methods in similar OOD scenarios. Despite the increased
variability observed when generalizing to cities in other continents,
particularly in Asia with its distinct urban typologies and prevalence of
high-rise structures, this study underscores the significant potential of DL
for robust cross-city and cross-continental transfer learning in building
height estimation from single VHR SAR data.

### [10] [RegGS: Unposed Sparse Views Gaussian Splatting with 3DGS Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08136)
*Chong Cheng,Yu Hu,Sicheng Yu,Beizhen Zhao,Zijian Wang,Hao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RegGS提出了一种基于3D高斯配准的框架，用于重建无位姿稀疏视图，通过熵正则化的Sinkhorn算法和联合配准模块，实现了高精度的相机位姿估计和高质量新视角合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D高斯重建方法在稀疏视图下表现不佳，且前馈高斯方法受限于输入格式，无法有效利用更多输入视图。RegGS旨在解决这些问题。

Method: RegGS通过熵正则化的Sinkhorn算法计算最优传输Mixture 2-Wasserstein距离，作为GMM的对齐度量，并结合光度一致性和深度几何设计联合配准模块。

Result: 在RE10K和ACID数据集上，RegGS实现了高保真度的局部高斯配准，精确的位姿估计和高质量新视角合成。

Conclusion: RegGS通过全局一致的高斯表示和联合配准策略，显著提升了稀疏视图下的3D重建质量。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated its potential in reconstructing
scenes from unposed images. However, optimization-based 3DGS methods struggle
with sparse views due to limited prior knowledge. Meanwhile, feed-forward
Gaussian approaches are constrained by input formats, making it challenging to
incorporate more input views. To address these challenges, we propose RegGS, a
3D Gaussian registration-based framework for reconstructing unposed sparse
views. RegGS aligns local 3D Gaussians generated by a feed-forward network into
a globally consistent 3D Gaussian representation. Technically, we implement an
entropy-regularized Sinkhorn algorithm to efficiently solve the optimal
transport Mixture 2-Wasserstein $(\text{MW}_2)$ distance, which serves as an
alignment metric for Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) in $\mathrm{Sim}(3)$ space.
Furthermore, we design a joint 3DGS registration module that integrates the
$\text{MW}_2$ distance, photometric consistency, and depth geometry. This
enables a coarse-to-fine registration process while accurately estimating
camera poses and aligning the scene. Experiments on the RE10K and ACID datasets
demonstrate that RegGS effectively registers local Gaussians with high
fidelity, achieving precise pose estimation and high-quality novel-view
synthesis. Project page: https://3dagentworld.github.io/reggs/.

### [11] [Upsample What Matters: Region-Adaptive Latent Sampling for Accelerated Diffusion Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08422)
*Wongi Jeong,Kyungryeol Lee,Hoigi Seo,Se Young Chun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为RALU的训练免费框架，通过空间维度加速扩散变换器的推理，显著减少计算量同时保持图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器虽然在高保真图像和视频生成中表现出色，但其高计算量限制了实际应用。现有加速方法主要利用时间维度，而RALU则专注于空间维度的优化。

Method: RALU采用三阶段混合分辨率采样：低分辨率去噪、区域自适应上采样和全分辨率细节细化，并通过噪声时间步重调度稳定生成。

Result: 在FLUX上实现了7.0倍加速，在Stable Diffusion 3上实现了3.0倍加速，且图像质量几乎无损。

Conclusion: RALU不仅高效，还能与现有时间维度加速方法互补，进一步降低推理延迟而不影响生成质量。

Abstract: Diffusion transformers have emerged as an alternative to U-net-based
diffusion models for high-fidelity image and video generation, offering
superior scalability. However, their heavy computation remains a major obstacle
to real-world deployment. Existing acceleration methods primarily exploit the
temporal dimension such as reusing cached features across diffusion timesteps.
Here, we propose Region-Adaptive Latent Upsampling (RALU), a training-free
framework that accelerates inference along spatial dimension. RALU performs
mixed-resolution sampling across three stages: 1) low-resolution denoising
latent diffusion to efficiently capture global semantic structure, 2)
region-adaptive upsampling on specific regions prone to artifacts at
full-resolution, and 3) all latent upsampling at full-resolution for detail
refinement. To stabilize generations across resolution transitions, we leverage
noise-timestep rescheduling to adapt the noise level across varying
resolutions. Our method significantly reduces computation while preserving
image quality by achieving up to 7.0$\times$ speed-up on FLUX and 3.0$\times$
on Stable Diffusion 3 with minimal degradation. Furthermore, RALU is
complementary to existing temporal accelerations such as caching methods, thus
can be seamlessly integrated to further reduce inference latency without
compromising generation quality.

*Hyungjun Doh,Dong In Lee,Seunggeun Chi,Pin-Hao Huang,Kwonjoon Lee,Sangpil Kim,Karthik Ramani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种从单目视频重建动态人-物交互的新框架，解决了遮挡和时间不一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D重建方法假设静态物体或完全可见的动态主体，在遮挡场景下性能下降。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用模态补全推断遮挡区域，结合时间上下文增强视频序列一致性，无需模板或预定义模型。

Result: 在单目视频上验证，3D高斯泼溅技术显示优于现有方法，处理遮挡和时间稳定性更精确。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了动态场景中复杂细节的恢复能力，适用于多变条件。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for reconstructing dynamic human-object
interactions from monocular video that overcomes challenges associated with
occlusions and temporal inconsistencies. Traditional 3D reconstruction methods
typically assume static objects or full visibility of dynamic subjects, leading
to degraded performance when these assumptions are violated-particularly in
scenarios where mutual occlusions occur. To address this, our framework
leverages amodal completion to infer the complete structure of partially
obscured regions. Unlike conventional approaches that operate on individual
frames, our method integrates temporal context, enforcing coherence across
video sequences to incrementally refine and stabilize reconstructions. This
template-free strategy adapts to varying conditions without relying on
predefined models, significantly enhancing the recovery of intricate details in
dynamic scenes. We validate our approach using 3D Gaussian Splatting on
challenging monocular videos, demonstrating superior precision in handling
occlusions and maintaining temporal stability compared to existing techniques.

*Frederick Shpilevskiy,Saiyue Lyu,Krishnamurthy Dj Dvijotham,Mathias Lécuyer,Pierre-André Noël*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应扩散去噪平滑方法，用于验证视觉模型对抗对抗样本的预测能力，并适应输入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过重新解释引导去噪扩散模型为一系列自适应高斯差分隐私机制，研究其端到端鲁棒性。

Method: 将引导去噪过程视为自适应GDP机制的序列，通过GDP隐私过滤器分析其鲁棒性。

Result: 在特定引导策略下，ImageNet上的认证准确率和标准准确率均有所提升。

Conclusion: 该方法扩展了自适应随机平滑分析，提供了可证明的认证能力。

Abstract: We propose Adaptive Diffusion Denoised Smoothing, a method for certifying the
predictions of a vision model against adversarial examples, while adapting to
the input. Our key insight is to reinterpret a guided denoising diffusion model
as a long sequence of adaptive Gaussian Differentially Private (GDP) mechanisms
refining a pure noise sample into an image. We show that these adaptive
mechanisms can be composed through a GDP privacy filter to analyze the
end-to-end robustness of the guided denoising process, yielding a provable
certification that extends the adaptive randomized smoothing analysis. We
demonstrate that our design, under a specific guiding strategy, can improve
both certified accuracy and standard accuracy on ImageNet for an $\ell_2$
threat model.

Result: 系统实现了轻量级实时深度估计和物体检测，mAP50为0.801。

Conclusion: 该系统能有效帮助视障人士避免碰撞，提升通勤安全性。

Abstract: Visually impaired people face significant challenges in their day-to-day
commutes in the urban cities of Bangladesh due to the vast number of
obstructions on every path. With many injuries taking place through road
accidents on a daily basis, it is paramount for a system to be developed that
can alert the visually impaired of objects at close distance beforehand. To
overcome this issue, a novel alert system is proposed in this research to
assist the visually impaired in commuting through these busy streets without
colliding with any objects. The proposed system can alert the individual to
objects that are present at a close distance. It utilizes transfer learning to
train models for depth estimation and object detection, and combines both
models to introduce a novel system. The models are optimized through the
utilization of quantization techniques to make them lightweight and efficient,
allowing them to be easily deployed on embedded systems. The proposed solution
achieved a lightweight real-time depth estimation and object detection model
with an mAP50 of 0.801.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CNN和Transformer在医学图像分割中因计算和内存限制导致的分辨率降低问题。

Method: 使用可学习的偏微分方程建模图像分割，通过Hartley变换替换傅里叶变换，提出HNOSeg-XS模型。

Result: 在多个数据集上测试，HNOSeg-XS表现出色，参数少于34.7k，推理时间<0.24秒，内存占用<1.8 GiB。

Conclusion: HNOSeg-XS在分辨率鲁棒性、速度和内存效率上优于CNN和Transformer模型。

Abstract: In medical image segmentation, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and
transformers are dominant. For CNNs, given the local receptive fields of
convolutional layers, long-range spatial correlations are captured through
consecutive convolutions and pooling. However, as the computational cost and
memory footprint can be prohibitively large, 3D models can only afford fewer
layers than 2D models with reduced receptive fields and abstract levels. For
transformers, although long-range correlations can be captured by multi-head
attention, its quadratic complexity with respect to input size is
computationally demanding. Therefore, either model may require input size
reduction to allow more filters and layers for better segmentation.
Nevertheless, given their discrete nature, models trained with patch-wise
training or image downsampling may produce suboptimal results when applied on
higher resolutions. To address this issue, here we propose the
resolution-robust HNOSeg-XS architecture. We model image segmentation by
learnable partial differential equations through the Fourier neural operator
which has the zero-shot super-resolution property. By replacing the Fourier
transform by the Hartley transform and reformulating the problem in the
frequency domain, we created the HNOSeg-XS model, which is resolution robust,
fast, memory efficient, and extremely parameter efficient. When tested on the
BraTS'23, KiTS'23, and MVSeg'23 datasets with a Tesla V100 GPU, HNOSeg-XS
showed its superior resolution robustness with fewer than 34.7k model
parameters. It also achieved the overall best inference time (< 0.24 s) and
memory efficiency (< 1.8 GiB) compared to the tested CNN and transformer
models.

### [16] [SurfDist: Interpretable Three-Dimensional Instance Segmentation Using Curved Surface Patches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08223)
*Jackson Borchardt,Saul Kato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SurfDist是一种用于三维体积实例分割的卷积神经网络架构，通过平滑参数化表面补丁表示实例，解决了StarDist-3D的局限性，并在某些数据集上表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决StarDist-3D中实例参数化维度与体素分辨率的耦合问题，并支持高分辨率预测以避免体素化伪影。

Method: 修改StarDist-3D架构，使用双三次贝塞尔三角形表示实例表面，实现更紧凑的参数化。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，SurfDist表现优于StarDist-3D，尤其在生物医学图像中。

Conclusion: SurfDist证明了可解释的实例表面模型可以与实例成员关系同时有效学习。

Abstract: We present SurfDist, a convolutional neural network architecture for
three-dimensional volumetric instance segmentation. SurfDist enables prediction
of instances represented as closed surfaces composed of smooth parametric
surface patches, specifically bicubic B\'ezier triangles. SurfDist is a
modification of the popular model architecture StarDist-3D which breaks
StarDist-3D's coupling of instance parameterization dimension and instance
voxel resolution, and it produces predictions which may be upsampled to
arbitrarily high resolutions without introduction of voxelization artifacts.
  For datasets with blob-shaped instances, common in biomedical imaging,
SurfDist can outperform StarDist-3D with more compact instance
parameterizations. We detail SurfDist's technical implementation and show one
synthetic and one real-world dataset for which it outperforms StarDist-3D.
These results demonstrate that interpretable instance surface models can be
learned effectively alongside instance membership.

Abstract: Accurate identification of fungi species presents a unique challenge in
computer vision due to fine-grained inter-species variation and high
intra-species variation. This paper presents our approach for the FungiCLEF
2025 competition, which focuses on few-shot fine-grained visual categorization
(FGVC) using the FungiTastic Few-Shot dataset. Our team (DS@GT) experimented
with multiple vision transformer models, data augmentation, weighted sampling,

for zero-shot classification using structured prompting but found them to
significantly underperform relative to vision-based models. Our final model
outperformed both competition baselines and highlighted the effectiveness of
domain specific pretraining and balanced sampling strategies. Our approach
ranked 35/74 on the private test set in post-completion evaluation, this

Motivation: 临床中缺乏客观测量运动的方法，限制了生物力学测量的广泛应用，PBL旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 开发了PBL系统，包括智能手机应用和算法，用于收集和分析运动数据，并在多种临床环境中验证其性能。

Result: PBL的关节角度误差在3度以内，步态指标可靠且能敏感反映临床差异，如与mJOA评分相关。

Conclusion: PBL为临床提供了一种可扩展、低负担的生物力学测量工具，有望广泛应用于运动障碍监测。

Abstract: The way a person moves is a direct reflection of their neurological and
musculoskeletal health, yet it remains one of the most underutilized vital
signs in clinical practice. Although clinicians visually observe movement
impairments, they lack accessible and validated methods to objectively measure
movement in routine care. This gap prevents wider use of biomechanical
measurements in practice, which could enable more sensitive outcome measures or
earlier identification of impairment. We present our Portable Biomechanics
Laboratory (PBL), which includes a secure, cloud-enabled smartphone app for
data collection and a novel algorithm for fitting biomechanical models to this
data. We extensively validated PBL's biomechanical measures using a large,
clinically representative dataset. Next, we tested the usability and utility of
our system in neurosurgery and sports medicine clinics. We found joint angle
errors within 3 degrees across participants with neurological injury,
lower-limb prosthesis users, pediatric inpatients, and controls. In addition to
being easy to use, gait metrics computed from the PBL showed high reliability
and were sensitive to clinical differences. For example, in individuals
undergoing decompression surgery for cervical myelopathy, the mJOA score is a
common patient-reported outcome measure; we found that PBL gait metrics
correlated with mJOA scores and demonstrated greater responsiveness to surgical
intervention than the patient-reported outcomes. These findings support the use
of handheld smartphone video as a scalable, low-burden tool for capturing
clinically meaningful biomechanical data, offering a promising path toward
accessible monitoring of mobility impairments. We release the first clinically
validated method for measuring whole-body kinematics from handheld smartphone
video at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为CR-Net的新方法，通过结合结构先验和证据学习理论，解决了SAR目标检测中因分辨率差异导致的泛化能力问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR分辨率的提升导致散射特性差异增大，影响目标检测模型的泛化能力，现有域适应技术存在盲特征适应和不可靠语义传播的问题。

Method: CR-Net结合了结构诱导的层次特征适应（SHFA）和可靠结构邻接对齐（RSAA）模块，实现结构感知的特征适应和可靠的语义对齐。

Result: 实验表明，CR-Net在跨分辨率SAR目标检测中显著提升了性能，达到了SOTA水平。

Conclusion: CR-Net通过保留域内结构和提升判别能力，有效解决了跨分辨率SAR目标检测的挑战。

Abstract: In recent years, continuous improvements in SAR resolution have significantly
benefited applications such as urban monitoring and target detection. However,
the improvement in resolution leads to increased discrepancies in scattering
characteristics, posing challenges to the generalization ability of target
detection models. While domain adaptation technology is a potential solution,
the inevitable discrepancies caused by resolution differences often lead to
blind feature adaptation and unreliable semantic propagation, ultimately
degrading the domain adaptation performance. To address these challenges, this
paper proposes a novel SAR target detection method (termed CR-Net), that
incorporates structure priors and evidential learning theory into the detection
model, enabling reliable domain adaptation for cross-resolution detection. To
be specific, CR-Net integrates Structure-induced Hierarchical Feature
Adaptation (SHFA) and Reliable Structural Adjacency Alignment (RSAA). SHFA
module is introduced to establish structural correlations between targets and
achieve structure-aware feature adaptation, thereby enhancing the
interpretability of the feature adaptation process. Afterwards, the RSAA module
is proposed to enhance reliable semantic alignment, by leveraging the secure
adjacency set to transfer valuable discriminative knowledge from the source
domain to the target domain. This further improves the discriminability of the
detection model in the target domain. Based on experimental results from
different-resolution datasets,the proposed CR-Net significantly enhances
cross-resolution adaptation by preserving intra-domain structures and improving
discriminability. It achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in
cross-resolution SAR target detection.

Motivation: 现有3D方法在运动建模和内容合成中存在渲染伪影（如运动模糊、时间抖动和局部穿透），限制了稳定、细粒度运动场的表示。

Method: 提出统一框架：视频预处理、运动表示和渲染重建；采用多粒度运动解耦策略独立建模非刚性和刚性运动，并设计运动一致性约束和交替优化策略。

Result: 实验表明，M2DAO-Talker在生成质量和视频真实感上优于TalkingGaussian（PSNR提升2.43 dB，用户评价真实感提升0.64），推理速度达150 FPS。

Conclusion: M2DAO-Talker通过改进的运动建模和优化策略，显著提升了说话头生成的性能和真实感。

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head generation holds significant potential for film
production. While existing 3D methods have advanced motion modeling and content
synthesis, they often produce rendering artifacts, such as motion blur,
temporal jitter, and local penetration, due to limitations in representing
stable, fine-grained motion fields. Through systematic analysis, we reformulate
talking head generation into a unified framework comprising three steps: video
preprocessing, motion representation, and rendering reconstruction. This
framework underpins our proposed M2DAO-Talker, which addresses current
limitations via multi-granular motion decoupling and alternating
optimization.Specifically, we devise a novel 2D portrait preprocessing pipeline
to extract frame-wise deformation control conditions (motion region
segmentation masks, and camera parameters) to facilitate motion representation.
To ameliorate motion modeling, we elaborate a multi-granular motion decoupling
strategy, which independently models non-rigid (oral and facial) and rigid
(head) motions for improved reconstruction accuracy.Meanwhile, a motion
consistency constraint is developed to ensure head-torso kinematic consistency,
thereby mitigating penetration artifacts caused by motion aliasing. In
addition, an alternating optimization strategy is designed to iteratively
refine facial and oral motion parameters, enabling more realistic video
generation.Experiments across multiple datasets show that M2DAO-Talker achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with the 2.43 dB PSNR improvement in generation
quality and 0.64 gain in user-evaluated video realness versus TalkingGaussian
while with 150 FPS inference speed. Our project homepage is

Conclusion: 该方法为头骨X射线图像的身份识别提供了一种有效解决方案。

Abstract: Craniofacial reconstruction in forensic science is crucial for the
identification of the victims of crimes and disasters. The objective is to map
a given skull to its corresponding face in a corpus of faces with known
identities using recent advancements in computer vision, such as deep learning.
In this paper, we presented a framework for the identification of a person
given the X-ray image of a skull using convolutional Siamese networks for
cross-domain identity representation. Siamese networks are twin networks that
share the same architecture and can be trained to discover a feature space
where nearby observations that are similar are grouped and dissimilar
observations are moved apart. To do this, the network is exposed to two sets of
comparable and different data. The Euclidean distance is then minimized between
similar pairs and maximized between dissimilar ones. Since getting pairs of
skull and face images are difficult, we prepared our own dataset of 40
volunteers whose front and side skull X-ray images and optical face images were
collected. Experiments were conducted on the collected cross-domain dataset to
train and validate the Siamese networks. The experimental results provide
satisfactory results on the identification of a person from the given skull.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在医学图像分析中取得显著进展，但模型规模大和缺乏透明度限制了其临床应用。

Method: 引入可解释性指导的剪枝框架，选择性保留每层最相关的部分，实现有针对性的压缩。

Result: 在多个医学图像分类基准测试中，该方法实现了高压缩率且精度损失最小。

Conclusion: 该方法为医疗场景中轻量级、可解释模型的部署铺平了道路。

Abstract: Deep learning has driven significant advances in medical image analysis, yet
its adoption in clinical practice remains constrained by the large size and
lack of transparency in modern models. Advances in interpretability techniques
such as DL-Backtrace, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation, and Integrated
Gradients make it possible to assess the contribution of individual components
within neural networks trained on medical imaging tasks. In this work, we
introduce an interpretability-guided pruning framework that reduces model
complexity while preserving both predictive performance and transparency. By
selectively retaining only the most relevant parts of each layer, our method
enables targeted compression that maintains clinically meaningful
representations. Experiments across multiple medical image classification
benchmarks demonstrate that this approach achieves high compression rates with
minimal loss in accuracy, paving the way for lightweight, interpretable models
suited for real-world deployment in healthcare settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统生成概念瓶颈模型依赖辅助视觉线索的问题，提升模型的解释性和组合性。

Method: 利用扩散能量函数引导，支持后处理干预（如概念组合和否定），仅通过显式概念传递信息。

Result: 在StyleGAN2预训练模型上，CoCo-Bot提升了概念级可控性和可解释性，同时保持视觉质量。

Conclusion: CoCo-Bot通过消除辅助线索，显著提升了生成模型的可解释性和组合性。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) provide interpretable and controllable
generative modeling by routing generation through explicit,
human-understandable concepts. However, previous generative CBMs often rely on
auxiliary visual cues at the bottleneck to compensate for information not
captured by the concepts, which undermines interpretability and
compositionality. We propose CoCo-Bot, a post-hoc, composable concept
bottleneck generative model that eliminates the need for auxiliary cues by
transmitting all information solely through explicit concepts. Guided by
diffusion-based energy functions, CoCo-Bot supports robust post-hoc
interventions-such as concept composition and negation-across arbitrary
concepts. Experiments using StyleGAN2 pre-trained on CelebA-HQ show that
CoCo-Bot improves concept-level controllability and interpretability, while
maintaining competitive visual quality.

Conclusion: 该研究为跨癌症多模态预后提供了实用且稳健的基础。

Abstract: Deep learning has shown remarkable performance in integrating multimodal data
for survival prediction. However, existing multimodal methods mainly focus on
single cancer types and overlook the challenge of generalization across
cancers. In this work, we are the first to reveal that multimodal prognosis
models often generalize worse than unimodal ones in cross-cancer scenarios,
despite the critical need for such robustness in clinical practice. To address
this, we propose a new task: Cross-Cancer Single Domain Generalization for
Multimodal Prognosis, which evaluates whether models trained on a single cancer
type can generalize to unseen cancers. We identify two key challenges: degraded
features from weaker modalities and ineffective multimodal integration. To
tackle these, we introduce two plug-and-play modules: Sparse Dirac Information
Rebalancer (SDIR) and Cancer-aware Distribution Entanglement (CADE). SDIR
mitigates the dominance of strong features by applying Bernoulli-based
sparsification and Dirac-inspired stabilization to enhance weaker modality
signals. CADE, designed to synthesize the target domain distribution, fuses
local morphological cues and global gene expression in latent space.
Experiments on a four-cancer-type benchmark demonstrate superior
generalization, laying the foundation for practical, robust cross-cancer
multimodal prognosis. Code is available at

Result: MRAG在隐写图像的隐蔽性和恢复能力上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: MRAG通过多范围表示和对抗性扰动，有效提升了隐写图像的隐蔽性和恢复能力。

Abstract: Deep hiding has been exploring the hiding capability of deep learning-based
models, aiming to conceal image-level messages into cover images and reveal
them from generated stego images. Existing schemes are easily detected by
steganalyzers due to their large payloads and their limitation to feature
extraction based solely on either pure convolution or pure transformer
operators within a single range, as well as pixel-level loss constraints. To
address the issue, in this paper, we introduce generation-based adversarial
attacks into color JPEG image deep hiding and propose a multi-range
representations-driven adversarial stego generation framework called MRAG from
a steganalysis perspective. Specifically, we integrate the local-range neighbor
reception characteristic of the convolution and the global-range dependency
modeling of the transformer to construct MRAG. Meanwhile, we use the
transformed images obtained through coarse-grained and fine-grained frequency
decomposition as inputs, introducing multi-grained information. Furthermore, a
features angle-norm disentanglement loss is designed to constrain the generated
stegos closer to covers in the angle and norm space of the steganalyzer's
classified features. Consequently, small yet effective adversarial
perturbations can be injected into the process of generating stegos, ensuring
that stegos maintain favorable secret restorability and imperceptibility.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MRAG can achieve state-of-the-art
performance.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Cycle Context Verification (CCV)的新框架，通过自我验证预测和增强上下文对齐，改进了基于上下文学习（ICL）的医学图像分割方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在临床场景中，由于注释医学图像的稀缺性，选择最优的上下文图像-掩码对具有挑战性，且对基础ICL模型进行微调在计算成本和灾难性遗忘风险方面不可行。

Method: CCV采用循环流程，首先生成查询图像的分割掩码，随后交换查询和上下文对角色以验证预测，并通过查询特定提示改进对齐。

Result: 在七个医学图像分割数据集上的实验表明，CCV优于现有方法，显著提升了ICL分割性能。

Conclusion: CCV是一种鲁棒的通用医学图像分割解决方案，能够增强基于ICL的分割效果。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is emerging as a promising technique for achieving
universal medical image segmentation, where a variety of objects of interest
across imaging modalities can be segmented using a single model. Nevertheless,
its performance is highly sensitive to the alignment between the query image
and in-context image-mask pairs. In a clinical scenario, the scarcity of
annotated medical images makes it challenging to select optimal in-context
pairs, and fine-tuning foundation ICL models on contextual data is infeasible
due to computational costs and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address
this challenge, we propose Cycle Context Verification (CCV), a novel framework
that enhances ICL-based medical image segmentation by enabling
self-verification of predictions and accordingly enhancing contextual
alignment. Specifically, CCV employs a cyclic pipeline in which the model
initially generates a segmentation mask for the query image. Subsequently, the
roles of the query and an in-context pair are swapped, allowing the model to
validate its prediction by predicting the mask of the original in-context
image. The accuracy of this secondary prediction serves as an implicit measure
of the initial query segmentation. A query-specific prompt is introduced to
alter the query image and updated to improve the measure, thereby enhancing the
alignment between the query and in-context pairs. We evaluated CCV on seven
medical image segmentation datasets using two ICL foundation models,
demonstrating its superiority over existing methods. Our results highlight
CCV's ability to enhance ICL-based segmentation, making it a robust solution
for universal medical image segmentation. The code will be available at

Motivation: 旨在验证大语言模型在复杂交通场景中的上下文推理能力，为老年驾驶员风险评估提供支持工具。

Method: 采用零样本、少样本和多样本提示策略，以人类标注为基准，评估模型的精确度、召回率和F1分数。

Result: 提示设计显著影响性能，多样本提示下交叉口可见性召回率从21.7%提升至57.0%，交通密度一致性从53.5%增至67.6%。停车标志检测精度高（86.3%），但召回率较低（76.7%）。

Conclusion: 研究表明，精心设计的提示可提升大语言模型在驾驶风险评估中的实用性，未来需扩展数据集和模型架构以优化性能。

Abstract: This study investigates the potential of a multimodal large language model
(LLM), specifically ChatGPT-4o, to perform human-like interpretations of
traffic scenes using static dashcam images. Herein, we focus on three judgment
tasks relevant to elderly driver assessments: evaluating traffic density,
assessing intersection visibility, and recognizing stop signs recognition.
These tasks require contextual reasoning rather than simple object detection.
Using zero-shot, few-shot, and multi-shot prompting strategies, we evaluated
the performance of the model with human annotations serving as the reference
standard. Evaluation metrics included precision, recall, and F1-score. Results
indicate that prompt design considerably affects performance, with recall for
intersection visibility increasing from 21.7% (zero-shot) to 57.0%
(multi-shot). For traffic density, agreement increased from 53.5% to 67.6%. In
stop-sign detection, the model demonstrated high precision (up to 86.3%) but a
lower recall (approximately 76.7%), indicating a conservative response
tendency. Output stability analysis revealed that humans and the model faced
difficulties interpreting structurally ambiguous scenes. However, the model's
explanatory texts corresponded with its predictions, enhancing
interpretability. These findings suggest that, with well-designed prompts, LLMs
hold promise as supportive tools for scene-level driving risk assessments.
Future studies should explore scalability using larger datasets, diverse
annotators, and next-generation model architectures for elderly driver
assessments.

Abstract: Video restoration and enhancement are critical not only for improving visual
quality, but also as essential pre-processing steps to boost the performance of
a wide range of downstream computer vision tasks. This survey presents a
comprehensive review of video restoration and enhancement techniques with a
particular focus on unsupervised approaches. We begin by outlining the most
common video degradations and their underlying causes, followed by a review of
early conventional and deep learning methods-based, highlighting their
strengths and limitations. We then present an in-depth overview of unsupervised
methods, categorise by their fundamental approaches, including domain
translation, self-supervision signal design and blind spot or noise-based
methods. We also provide a categorization of loss functions employed in
unsupervised video restoration and enhancement, and discuss the role of paired
synthetic datasets in enabling objective evaluation. Finally, we identify key
challenges and outline promising directions for future research in this field.

Conclusion: GEFU框架有效提升了低光视觉任务的泛化性和扩展性。

Abstract: Low-level enhancement and high-level visual understanding in low-light vision
have traditionally been treated separately. Low-light enhancement improves
image quality for downstream tasks, but existing methods rely on physical or
geometric priors, limiting generalization. Evaluation mainly focuses on visual
quality rather than downstream performance. Low-light visual understanding,
constrained by scarce labeled data, primarily uses task-specific domain
adaptation, which lacks scalability. To address these challenges, we build a
generalized bridge between low-light enhancement and low-light understanding,
which we term Generalized Enhancement For Understanding (GEFU). This paradigm
improves both generalization and scalability. To address the diverse causes of
low-light degradation, we leverage pretrained generative diffusion models to
optimize images, achieving zero-shot generalization performance. Building on
this, we propose Semantically Consistent Unsupervised Fine-tuning (SCUF).
Specifically, to overcome text prompt limitations, we introduce an
illumination-aware image prompt to explicitly guide image generation and
propose a cycle-attention adapter to maximize its semantic potential. To
mitigate semantic degradation in unsupervised training, we propose caption and
reflectance consistency to learn high-level semantics and image-level spatial
semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method
outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in traditional image quality and
GEFU tasks including classification, detection, and semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Real-world applications of computer vision in the humanities require
algorithms to be robust against artistic abstraction, peripheral objects, and
subtle differences between fine-grained target classes. Existing datasets
provide instance-level annotations on artworks but are generally biased towards
the image centre and limited with regard to detailed object classes. The
proposed ODOR dataset fills this gap, offering 38,116 object-level annotations
across 4712 images, spanning an extensive set of 139 fine-grained categories.
Conducting a statistical analysis, we showcase challenging dataset properties,
such as a detailed set of categories, dense and overlapping objects, and
spatial distribution over the whole image canvas. Furthermore, we provide an
extensive baseline analysis for object detection models and highlight the
challenging properties of the dataset through a set of secondary studies.
Inspiring further research on artwork object detection and broader visual
cultural heritage studies, the dataset challenges researchers to explore the
intersection of object recognition and smell perception.

Motivation: 现有方法在保持主题一致性时牺牲了姿势和布局多样性，限制了视觉叙事的表达力。

Method: 采用两阶段策略：身份传输（IT）在早期去噪步骤中通过最优传输传递身份特征；身份细化（IR）在后期去噪步骤中选择最显著特征细化主题细节。

Result: 实验表明CoDi在主题一致性、姿势多样性和提示保真度上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CoDi框架在保持主题一致性的同时实现了姿势多样性，提升了视觉感知和性能。

Abstract: Subject-consistent generation (SCG)-aiming to maintain a consistent subject
identity across diverse scenes-remains a challenge for text-to-image (T2I)
models. Existing training-free SCG methods often achieve consistency at the
cost of layout and pose diversity, hindering expressive visual storytelling. To
address the limitation, we propose subject-Consistent and pose-Diverse T2I
framework, dubbed as CoDi, that enables consistent subject generation with
diverse pose and layout. Motivated by the progressive nature of diffusion,
where coarse structures emerge early and fine details are refined later, CoDi
adopts a two-stage strategy: Identity Transport (IT) and Identity Refinement
(IR). IT operates in the early denoising steps, using optimal transport to
transfer identity features to each target image in a pose-aware manner. This
promotes subject consistency while preserving pose diversity. IR is applied in
the later denoising steps, selecting the most salient identity features to
further refine subject details. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results
on subject consistency, pose diversity, and prompt fidelity demonstrate that
CoDi achieves both better visual perception and stronger performance across all
metrics. The code is provided in https://github.com/NJU-PCALab/CoDi.

TL;DR: PanMatch是一个通用的基础模型，用于鲁棒的对应匹配，通过统一的2D位移估计框架支持多任务，无需特定任务架构或微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要针对不同任务设计专用架构或微调，而PanMatch旨在通过统一框架实现多任务集成，提升泛化能力。

Method: 提出基于2D位移估计的统一框架，利用跨域特征提取器和大型视觉模型的特征转换管道，预训练于包含180万样本的跨域数据集。

Result: PanMatch在跨任务评估中优于UniMatch和Flow-Anything，在任务特定基准上与SOTA算法相当，并在异常场景（如雨天和卫星图像）中表现出零样本能力。

Conclusion: PanMatch展示了统一框架在多任务对应匹配中的潜力，尤其在泛化和零样本性能方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: This work presents PanMatch, a versatile foundation model for robust
correspondence matching. Unlike previous methods that rely on task-specific
architectures and domain-specific fine-tuning to support tasks like stereo
matching, optical flow or feature matching, our key insight is that any
two-frame correspondence matching task can be addressed within a 2D
displacement estimation framework using the same model weights. Such a
formulation eliminates the need for designing specialized unified architectures
or task-specific ensemble models. Instead, it achieves multi-task integration
by endowing displacement estimation algorithms with unprecedented
generalization capabilities. To this end, we highlight the importance of a
robust feature extractor applicable across multiple domains and tasks, and
propose the feature transformation pipeline that leverage all-purpose features
from Large Vision Models to endow matching baselines with zero-shot cross-view
matching capabilities. Furthermore, we assemble a cross-domain dataset with
near 1.8 million samples from stereo matching, optical flow, and feature
matching domains to pretrain PanMatch. We demonstrate the versatility of
PanMatch across a wide range of domains and downstream tasks using the same
model weights. Our model outperforms UniMatch and Flow-Anything on cross-task
evaluations, and achieves comparable performance to most state-of-the-art
task-specific algorithms on task-oriented benchmarks. Additionally, PanMatch
presents unprecedented zero-shot performance in abnormal scenarios, such as
rainy day and satellite imagery, where most existing robust algorithms fail to
yield meaningful results.

TL;DR: SHC提出了一种基于语义哈希中心的三阶段框架，显著提升了大规模图像检索性能。

Motivation: 现有哈希中心方法忽略了类间语义关系，可能影响检索性能。

Method: 1. 使用分类网络计算类间语义相似性；2. 优化算法生成语义哈希中心；3. 训练深度哈希网络生成二进制哈希码。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上，SHC在MAP@100、MAP@1000和MAP@ALL指标上分别平均提升7.26%、7.62%和11.71%。

Conclusion: SHC通过保留语义结构，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Deep hashing is an effective approach for large-scale image retrieval.
Current methods are typically classified by their supervision types:
point-wise, pair-wise, and list-wise. Recent point-wise techniques (e.g., CSQ,
MDS) have improved retrieval performance by pre-assigning a hash center to each
class, enhancing the discriminability of hash codes across various datasets.
However, these methods rely on data-independent algorithms to generate hash
centers, which neglect the semantic relationships between classes and may
degrade retrieval performance.
  This paper introduces the concept of semantic hash centers, building on the
idea of traditional hash centers. We hypothesize that hash centers of
semantically related classes should have closer Hamming distances, while those
of unrelated classes should be more distant. To this end, we propose a
three-stage framework, SHC, to generate hash codes that preserve semantic
structure.
  First, we develop a classification network to identify semantic similarities
between classes using a data-dependent similarity calculation that adapts to
varying data distributions. Second, we introduce an optimization algorithm to
generate semantic hash centers, preserving semantic relatedness while enforcing
a minimum distance between centers to avoid excessively similar hash codes.
Finally, a deep hashing network is trained using these semantic centers to
convert images into binary hash codes.
  Experimental results on large-scale retrieval tasks across several public
datasets show that SHC significantly improves retrieval performance.
Specifically, SHC achieves average improvements of +7.26%, +7.62%, and +11.71%
in MAP@100, MAP@1000, and MAP@ALL metrics, respectively, over state-of-the-art
methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决提示学习中类别嵌入分布建模不足和跨模态对齐局限于输出层的问题，以提升模型在新类别上的泛化能力和多模态空间的一致性。

Method: 利用多模态大语言模型生成语义条件提示（SCP），引入注意力相互引导模块（AMG）生成视觉条件提示（VCP），并通过多提示融合机制（MPF）整合不同提示。

Result: 在14个数据集上优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: MuGCP通过条件提示生成和多模态交互，显著提升了视觉语言模型的性能，为多模态任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Prompt learning facilitates the efficient adaptation of Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) to various downstream tasks. However, it faces two significant
challenges: (1) inadequate modeling of class embedding distributions for unseen
instances, leading to suboptimal generalization on novel classes; (2)
prevailing methodologies predominantly confine cross-modal alignment to the
final output layer of vision and text encoders, which fundamentally limits
their capacity to preserve topological consistency with pre-trained multi-modal
embedding spaces. To this end, we introduce MuGCP (Multi-modal Mutual-Guidance
Conditional Prompt Learning), a novel paradigm designed for conditional prompt
generation. MuGCP leverages Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as
conditional prompt learners to adaptively generate Semantic Conditional Prompts
(SCP) that incorporate rich, fine-grained high-level semantic knowledge for
image instances. To ensure effective alignment and interaction across the
multi-modal space of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), we introduce the Attention
Mutual-Guidance (AMG) module, which facilitates interactions between visual and
semantic information. Through mutual guidance, the AMG module generates Visual
Conditional Prompts (VCP), enhancing the model's performance in multi-modal
tasks. Additionally, we present a Multi-Prompt Fusion (MPF) mechanism that
integrates SCP and VCP with contextual prompts, ensuring seamless coordination
among the different prompts and enhancing the modeling of class embeddings and
instance-specific knowledge. Our MuGCP outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods on 14 different datasets. The code will be made available after
publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能自然识别和补全遮挡物体，但机器人难以实现类似能力。现有技术将场景视为整体，无法从部分观察中识别完整对象。

Method: 开发了空间对比学习技术，通过追踪实例的视图光栅化增强语义监督；引入原位生成技术，利用观察和几何线索指导3D生成模型。

Result: 在复杂场景分解和对象补全实验中，方法表现出更高的分解准确性和几何完整性。

Conclusion: InstaScene在3D场景感知中实现了精确分解和完整重建，为机器人认知能力提供了新思路。

Abstract: Humans can naturally identify and mentally complete occluded objects in
cluttered environments. However, imparting similar cognitive ability to
robotics remains challenging even with advanced reconstruction techniques,
which models scenes as undifferentiated wholes and fails to recognize complete
object from partial observations. In this paper, we propose InstaScene, a new
paradigm towards holistic 3D perception of complex scenes with a primary goal:
decomposing arbitrary instances while ensuring complete reconstruction. To
achieve precise decomposition, we develop a novel spatial contrastive learning
by tracing rasterization of each instance across views, significantly enhancing
semantic supervision in cluttered scenes. To overcome incompleteness from
limited observations, we introduce in-situ generation that harnesses valuable
observations and geometric cues, effectively guiding 3D generative models to
reconstruct complete instances that seamlessly align with the real world.
Experiments on scene decomposition and object completion across complex
real-world and synthetic scenes demonstrate that our method achieves superior
decomposition accuracy while producing geometrically faithful and visually
intact objects.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在复杂场景中实现了更真实且一致的3D场景修复效果。

Abstract: Radiance field methods, such as Neural Radiance Field or 3D Gaussian
Splatting, have emerged as seminal 3D representations for synthesizing
realistic novel views. For practical applications, there is ongoing research on
flexible scene editing techniques, among which object removal is a
representative task. However, removing objects exposes occluded regions, often
leading to unnatural appearances. Thus, studies have employed image inpainting
techniques to replace such regions with plausible content - a task referred to
as 3D scene inpainting. However, image inpainting methods produce one of many
plausible completions for each view, leading to inconsistencies between
viewpoints. A widely adopted approach leverages perceptual cues to blend
inpainted views smoothly. However, it is prone to detail loss and can fail when
there are perceptual inconsistencies across views. In this paper, we propose a
novel 3D scene inpainting method that reliably produces realistic and
perceptually consistent results even for complex scenes by leveraging a
reference view. Given the inpainted reference view, we estimate the inpainting
similarity of the other views to adjust their contribution in constructing an
accurate geometry tailored to the reference. This geometry is then used to warp
the reference inpainting to other views as pseudo-ground truth, guiding the
optimization to match the reference appearance. Comparative evaluation studies
have shown that our approach improves both the geometric fidelity and
appearance consistency of inpainted scenes.

Conclusion: VFMTok展示了预训练视觉基础模型在图像分词任务中的潜力，为社区提供了高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Leveraging the powerful representations of pre-trained vision foundation
models -- traditionally used for visual comprehension -- we explore a novel
direction: building an image tokenizer directly atop such models, a largely
underexplored area. Specifically, we employ a frozen vision foundation model as
the encoder of our tokenizer. To enhance its effectiveness, we introduce two
key components: (1) a region-adaptive quantization framework that reduces
redundancy in the pre-trained features on regular 2D grids, and (2) a semantic
reconstruction objective that aligns the tokenizer's outputs with the
foundation model's representations to preserve semantic fidelity. Based on
these designs, our proposed image tokenizer, VFMTok, achieves substantial
improvements in image reconstruction and generation quality, while also
enhancing token efficiency. It further boosts autoregressive (AR) generation --
achieving a gFID of 2.07 on ImageNet benchmarks, while accelerating model
convergence by three times, and enabling high-fidelity class-conditional
synthesis without the need for classifier-free guidance (CFG). The code will be
released publicly to benefit the community.

Conclusion: 深度学习为3D重建带来革命性变革，未来需解决模型精度、可扩展性及动态场景处理等问题。

Abstract: 3D reconstruction, which aims to recover the dense three-dimensional
structure of a scene, is a cornerstone technology for numerous applications,
including augmented/virtual reality, autonomous driving, and robotics. While
traditional pipelines like Structure from Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo
(MVS) achieve high precision through iterative optimization, they are limited
by complex workflows, high computational cost, and poor robustness in
challenging scenarios like texture-less regions. Recently, deep learning has
catalyzed a paradigm shift in 3D reconstruction. A new family of models,
exemplified by DUSt3R, has pioneered a feed-forward approach. These models
employ a unified deep network to jointly infer camera poses and dense geometry
directly from an Unconstrained set of images in a single forward pass. This
survey provides a systematic review of this emerging domain. We begin by
dissecting the technical framework of these feed-forward models, including
their Transformer-based correspondence modeling, joint pose and geometry
regression mechanisms, and strategies for scaling from two-view to multi-view
scenarios. To highlight the disruptive nature of this new paradigm, we contrast
it with both traditional pipelines and earlier learning-based methods like
MVSNet. Furthermore, we provide an overview of relevant datasets and evaluation
metrics. Finally, we discuss the technology's broad application prospects and
identify key future challenges and opportunities, such as model accuracy and
scalability, and handling dynamic scenes.

Result: 通过实验验证了方法在复杂文档类型（如乐谱、工程图）中的有效性，首次实现端到端工程图转录。

Conclusion: 该方法为设计文档识别系统提供了新思路，并为未来文档基础模型的统一设计提供了指导。

Abstract: Many document types use intrinsic, convention-driven structures that serve to
encode precise and structured information, such as the conventions governing
engineering drawings. However, state-of-the-art approaches treat document
recognition as a mere computer vision problem, neglecting these underlying
document-type-specific structural properties, making them dependent on
sub-optimal heuristic post-processing and rendering many less frequent or more
complicated document types inaccessible to modern document recognition. We
suggest a novel perspective that frames document recognition as a transcription
task from a document to a record. This implies a natural grouping of documents
based on the intrinsic structure inherent in their transcription, where related
document types can be treated (and learned) similarly. We propose a method to
design structure-specific inductive biases for the underlying machine-learned
end-to-end document recognition systems, and a respective base transformer
architecture that we successfully adapt to different structures. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of the so-found inductive biases in extensive experiments
with progressively complex record structures from monophonic sheet music, shape
drawings, and simplified engineering drawings. By integrating an inductive bias
for unrestricted graph structures, we train the first-ever successful
end-to-end model to transcribe engineering drawings to their inherently
interlinked information. Our approach is relevant to inform the design of
document recognition systems for document types that are less well understood
than standard OCR, OMR, etc., and serves as a guide to unify the design of
future document foundation models.

Conclusion: F3-Net是一种多功能、可扩展的解决方案，填补了深度学习研究与实际临床部署之间的差距。

Abstract: F3-Net is a foundation model designed to overcome persistent challenges in
clinical medical image segmentation, including reliance on complete multimodal
inputs, limited generalizability, and narrow task specificity. Through flexible
synthetic modality training, F3-Net maintains robust performance even in the
presence of missing MRI sequences, leveraging a zero-image strategy to
substitute absent modalities without relying on explicit synthesis networks,
thereby enhancing real-world applicability. Its unified architecture supports
multi-pathology segmentation across glioma, metastasis, stroke, and white
matter lesions without retraining, outperforming CNN-based and
transformer-based models that typically require disease-specific fine-tuning.
Evaluated on diverse datasets such as BraTS 2021, BraTS 2024, and ISLES 2022,
F3-Net demonstrates strong resilience to domain shifts and clinical
heterogeneity. On the whole pathology dataset, F3-Net achieves average Dice
Similarity Coefficients (DSCs) of 0.94 for BraTS-GLI 2024, 0.82 for BraTS-MET
2024, 0.94 for BraTS 2021, and 0.79 for ISLES 2022. This positions it as a
versatile, scalable solution bridging the gap between deep learning research

Abstract: Document image dewarping remains a challenging task in the deep learning era.
While existing methods have improved by leveraging text line awareness, they
typically focus only on a single horizontal dimension. In this paper, we
propose a fine-grained deformation perception model that focuses on Dual
Dimensions of document horizontal-vertical-lines to improve document Dewarping
called D2Dewarp. It can perceive distortion trends in different directions
across document details. To combine the horizontal and vertical granularity
features, an effective fusion module based on X and Y coordinate is designed to
facilitate interaction and constraint between the two dimensions for feature
complementarity. Due to the lack of annotated line features in current public
dewarping datasets, we also propose an automatic fine-grained annotation method
using public document texture images and an automatic rendering engine to build
a new large-scale distortion training dataset. The code and dataset will be
publicly released. On public Chinese and English benchmarks, both quantitative
and qualitative results show that our method achieves better rectification
results compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The dataset will be

the graph can also encode scene-specific information. We also introduce a new
large-scale dataset with 25 partially overlapping views, detailed scene
reconstructions, and extensive occlusions. Experiments show the model achieves
state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks and the new dataset, with
flexibility across diverse conditions. Both the dataset and approach will be
publicly released to advance research in multi-people tracking.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为OGFR的方法，通过强化知识蒸馏解决遮挡行人重识别中的多样遮挡场景和特征污染问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理未训练过的遮挡场景和避免特征污染方面存在不足。

Method: 采用教师-学生蒸馏架构，设计了遮挡感知视觉Transformer和特征擦除与净化模块。

Result: OGFR能够有效学习鲁棒特征表示，减少遮挡干扰。

Conclusion: OGFR在遮挡行人重识别任务中表现出色，解决了多样遮挡和特征污染问题。

Abstract: Occluded person re-identification aims to retrieve holistic images based on
occluded ones. Existing methods often rely on aligning visible body parts,
applying occlusion augmentation, or complementing missing semantics using
holistic images. However, they face challenges in handling diverse occlusion
scenarios not seen during training and the issue of feature contamination from
holistic images. To address these limitations, we propose Occlusion-Guided
Feature Purification Learning via Reinforced Knowledge Distillation (OGFR),
which simultaneously mitigates these challenges. OGFR adopts a teacher-student
distillation architecture that effectively incorporates diverse occlusion
patterns into feature representation while transferring the purified
discriminative holistic knowledge from the holistic to the occluded branch
through reinforced knowledge distillation. Specifically, an Occlusion-Aware
Vision Transformer is designed to leverage learnable occlusion pattern
embeddings to explicitly model such diverse occlusion types, thereby guiding
occlusion-aware robust feature representation. Moreover, we devise a Feature
Erasing and Purification Module within the holistic branch, in which an agent
is employed to identify low-quality patch tokens of holistic images that
contain noisy negative information via deep reinforcement learning, and
substitute these patch tokens with learnable embedding tokens to avoid feature
contamination and further excavate identity-related discriminative clues.
Afterward, with the assistance of knowledge distillation, the student branch
effectively absorbs the purified holistic knowledge to precisely learn robust
representation regardless of the interference of occlusions.

*Inye Na,Nejung Rue,Jiwon Chung,Hyunjin Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RadiomicsRetrieval是一个基于3D内容的医学图像检索框架，结合手工放射组学特征和深度学习嵌入，支持灵活查询，显著提升检索特异性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学图像检索方法主要支持2D图像且需要完全标注的查询，限制了临床灵活性。

Method: 提出RadiomicsRetrieval框架，利用可提示分割模型（如SAM）生成肿瘤特异性图像嵌入，并通过对比学习与放射组学特征对齐，结合解剖位置嵌入（APE）丰富表示。

Result: 在肺CT和脑MRI数据集上的实验表明，放射组学特征显著提升检索特异性，APE为基于位置的搜索提供全局解剖上下文。

Conclusion: 该框架仅需最小用户提示（如单点），支持灵活查询，适用于诊断、治疗规划和大规模医学影像研究。

Abstract: Medical image retrieval is a valuable field for supporting clinical
decision-making, yet current methods primarily support 2D images and require
fully annotated queries, limiting clinical flexibility. To address this, we
propose RadiomicsRetrieval, a 3D content-based retrieval framework bridging
handcrafted radiomics descriptors with deep learning-based embeddings at the
tumor level. Unlike existing 2D approaches, RadiomicsRetrieval fully exploits
volumetric data to leverage richer spatial context in medical images. We employ
a promptable segmentation model (e.g., SAM) to derive tumor-specific image
embeddings, which are aligned with radiomics features extracted from the same
tumor via contrastive learning. These representations are further enriched by
anatomical positional embedding (APE). As a result, RadiomicsRetrieval enables
flexible querying based on shape, location, or partial feature sets. Extensive
experiments on both lung CT and brain MRI public datasets demonstrate that
radiomics features significantly enhance retrieval specificity, while APE
provides global anatomical context essential for location-based searches.
Notably, our framework requires only minimal user prompts (e.g., a single
point), minimizing segmentation overhead and supporting diverse clinical
scenarios. The capability to query using either image embeddings or selected
radiomics attributes highlights its adaptability, potentially benefiting
diagnosis, treatment planning, and research on large-scale medical imaging
repositories. Our code is available at

TL;DR: SAM 2在目标分割任务中表现优异，成为视觉目标跟踪的SOTA。本文提出用强化学习优化其记忆更新，性能提升显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过手工规则优化SAM 2的记忆更新，但效果有限。本文探索强化学习作为替代方案，以更好地处理干扰、遮挡和运动问题。

Method: 将记忆控制建模为序列决策问题，使用强化学习优化SAM 2的记忆更新策略。

Result: 在单视频代理的过拟合实验中，性能提升超过现有启发式方法的三倍。

Conclusion: 强化学习在记忆控制中潜力巨大，是手工规则的有力替代方案。

Abstract: Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) has demonstrated strong performance in
object segmentation tasks and has become the state-of-the-art for visual object
tracking. The model stores information from previous frames in a memory bank,
enabling temporal consistency across video sequences. Recent methods augment
SAM 2 with hand-crafted update rules to better handle distractors, occlusions,
and object motion. We propose a fundamentally different approach using
reinforcement learning for optimizing memory updates in SAM 2 by framing memory
control as a sequential decision-making problem. In an overfitting setup with a
separate agent per video, our method achieves a relative improvement over SAM 2
that exceeds by more than three times the gains of existing heuristics. These
results reveal the untapped potential of the memory bank and highlight
reinforcement learning as a powerful alternative to hand-crafted update rules
for memory control in visual object tracking.

TL;DR: DA-KPN是一种新的图像翻译方法，通过轻量级翻译函数和对抗性判别器，确保合成标签与翻译图像的语义匹配，优于现有GAN方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有无配对图像翻译方法在语义分割中因语义匹配不保证而导致的性能问题。

Method: 提出Domain Adversarial Kernel Prediction Network (DA-KPN)，通过估计像素级输入变换参数，并结合多尺度判别器确保翻译真实性。

Result: 在有限真实标签的语义分割任务中，DA-KPN优于现有GAN方法，在人脸解析任务中表现相当。

Conclusion: DA-KPN在低数据环境下有效提升语义分割性能，为合成数据到真实数据的转换提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation relies on many dense pixel-wise annotations to achieve
the best performance, but owing to the difficulty of obtaining accurate
annotations for real world data, practitioners train on large-scale synthetic
datasets. Unpaired image translation is one method used to address the ensuing
domain gap by generating more realistic training data in low-data regimes.
Current methods for unpaired image translation train generative adversarial
networks (GANs) to perform the translation and enforce pixel-level semantic
matching through cycle consistency. These methods do not guarantee that the
semantic matching holds, posing a problem for semantic segmentation where
performance is sensitive to noisy pixel labels. We propose a novel image
translation method, Domain Adversarial Kernel Prediction Network (DA-KPN), that
guarantees semantic matching between the synthetic label and translation.
DA-KPN estimates pixel-wise input transformation parameters of a lightweight
and simple translation function. To ensure the pixel-wise transformation is
realistic, DA-KPN uses multi-scale discriminators to distinguish between
translated and target samples. We show DA-KPN outperforms previous GAN-based
methods on syn2real benchmarks for semantic segmentation with limited access to
real image labels and achieves comparable performance on face parsing.

TL;DR: DISC提出了一种双流范式，通过分离优化实例和场景类别，提升了3D语义场景补全的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法以体素为基本交互单元，限制了类别级信息的利用，影响了补全结果的精细度。

Method: 使用区分性类别查询替代体素查询，并设计专门的解码模块，促进目标交互和类别级信息流。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI和SSCBench-KITTI-360基准测试中达到SOTA性能，单帧输入甚至优于多帧方法。

Conclusion: DISC通过分离优化实例和场景类别，显著提升了3D语义场景补全的性能和实例类别表现。

Abstract: 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has gained increasing attention due to its
pivotal role in 3D perception. Recent advancements have primarily focused on
refining voxel-level features to construct 3D scenes. However, treating voxels
as the basic interaction units inherently limits the utilization of class-level
information, which is proven critical for enhancing the granularity of
completion results. To address this, we propose \textbf{D}isentangling Instance
and Scene Contexts (DISC), a novel dual-stream paradigm that enhances learning
for both instance and scene categories through separated optimization.
Specifically, we replace voxel queries with discriminative class queries, which
incorporate class-specific geometric and semantic priors. Additionally, we
exploit the intrinsic properties of classes to design specialized decoding
modules, facilitating targeted interactions and efficient class-level
information flow. Experimental results demonstrate that DISC achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both SemanticKITTI and
SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks, with mIoU scores of 17.35 and 20.55,
respectively. Remarkably, DISC even outperforms multi-frame SOTA methods using
only single-frame input and significantly improves instance category
performance, surpassing both single-frame and multi-frame SOTA instance mIoU by
17.9\% and 11.9\%, respectively, on the SemanticKITTI hidden test. The code is

Interactive Visual-semantic Attention (BIVA) enabling iterative information
exchange between modalities. The framework was evaluated on BraTS 2020 dataset

2.8256mm across enhancing tumor, tumor core, and whole tumor regions,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods including SCAU-Net, CA-Net, and 3D
U-Net. Ablation studies confirmed critical contributions of semantic and
spatial modules to boundary precision. Conclusion: Multi-modal semantic fusion
combined with bidirectional interactive attention significantly enhances brain
tumor segmentation performance, establishing new paradigms for integrating
clinical knowledge into medical image analysis.

TL;DR: 论文提出BayesTTA框架，解决视觉语言模型在时间演化分布偏移下的适应问题，通过贝叶斯方法实现时间一致性预测和动态表示对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有持续测试时适应方法忽视时间连续性，导致记忆限制、熵置信度不可靠和静态表示不对齐等问题，需解决时间演化分布偏移的挑战。

Method: 提出BayesTTA，基于贝叶斯框架，增量估计类条件高斯混合分布，自适应选择协方差结构，并通过GDA进行校准推断。

Result: 在四个时间演化数据集和十个标准TTA数据集上，BayesTTA显著优于现有方法，保持高效性。

Conclusion: BayesTTA通过贝叶斯方法有效解决了时间演化分布偏移问题，提升了模型的适应性和性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP achieve strong zero-shot
recognition but degrade significantly under \textit{temporally evolving
distribution shifts} common in real-world scenarios (e.g., gradual illumination
or seasonal changes). Existing continual test-time adaptation (CTTA) methods
are typically built around sudden and severe distribution shifts and neglect
temporal continuity, leading to three core defects: limited memory cache
restricts long-range distribution modeling, causing catastrophic forgetting;
entropy-based confidence becomes unreliable under temporal drift, worsening
error accumulation; and static visual representations misalign with evolving
inputs. We formalize this practical problem as \textit{Continual-Temporal
Test-Time Adaptation (CT-TTA)}, where test distributions evolve gradually over
time. To address it, we propose \textit{BayesTTA}, a Bayesian adaptation
framework that enforces temporally consistent predictions and dynamically
aligns visual representations. Specifically, BayesTTA incrementally estimates
class-conditional Gaussian mixture distributions without storing raw data,
adaptively selects covariance structures through statistical hypothesis
testing, and performs calibrated inference using Gaussian discriminant analysis
(GDA). These calibrated predictions supervise self-paced adaptation of
normalization layers, ensuring efficient and stable representation alignment.
We establish a comprehensive CT-TTA benchmark across four temporally evolving
datasets and further evaluate generalization on ten standard TTA datasets.
Extensive experiments show that BayesTTA consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant gains while maintaining
efficiency. Code is available at

Method: 使用两种不同标注方法的数据集（201份出生证明扫描件），对DAN进行微调。

Result: 标准化标注适用于可标准化字段（如日期、出生地），而外交标注更适用于不可标准化字段（如姓名）。

Conclusion: 不同标注策略适用于不同类型的字段，需根据字段特性选择合适的标注方法。

Abstract: This study evaluates the recently proposed Document Attention Network (DAN)
for extracting key-value information from Uruguayan birth certificates,
handwritten in Spanish. We investigate two annotation strategies for
automatically transcribing handwritten documents, fine-tuning DAN with minimal
training data and annotation effort. Experiments were conducted on two datasets
containing the same images (201 scans of birth certificates written by more
than 15 different writers) but with different annotation methods. Our findings
indicate that normalized annotation is more effective for fields that can be
standardized, such as dates and places of birth, whereas diplomatic annotation
performs much better for fields containing names and surnames, which can not be
standardized.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多帧BEV特征结合时，由于物体运动导致特征动态变化，性能提升受限，需要一种更有效的时序特征对齐方法。

Method: 提出OnlineBEV方法，采用循环结构结合BEV特征，使用MBFNet提取运动特征并动态对齐历史与当前特征，引入时序一致性学习损失。

Result: 在nuScenes测试集上达到63.9% NDS，性能优于当前最佳方法SOLOFusion。

Conclusion: OnlineBEV通过时序特征对齐和循环结构，显著提升了相机3D感知性能，实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Multi-view camera-based 3D perception can be conducted using bird's eye view
(BEV) features obtained through perspective view-to-BEV transformations.
Several studies have shown that the performance of these 3D perception methods
can be further enhanced by combining sequential BEV features obtained from
multiple camera frames. However, even after compensating for the ego-motion of
an autonomous agent, the performance gain from temporal aggregation is limited
when combining a large number of image frames. This limitation arises due to
dynamic changes in BEV features over time caused by object motion. In this
paper, we introduce a novel temporal 3D perception method called OnlineBEV,
which combines BEV features over time using a recurrent structure. This
structure increases the effective number of combined features with minimal
memory usage. However, it is critical to spatially align the features over time
to maintain strong performance. OnlineBEV employs the Motion-guided BEV Fusion
Network (MBFNet) to achieve temporal feature alignment. MBFNet extracts motion
features from consecutive BEV frames and dynamically aligns historical BEV
features with current ones using these motion features. To enforce temporal
feature alignment explicitly, we use Temporal Consistency Learning Loss, which
captures discrepancies between historical and target BEV features. Experiments
conducted on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that OnlineBEV achieves
significant performance gains over the current best method, SOLOFusion.
OnlineBEV achieves 63.9% NDS on the nuScenes test set, recording
state-of-the-art performance in the camera-only 3D object detection task.

Motivation: 传统手动构建图像数据集的方法耗时且低效，而AI生成的数据不如真实数据有价值，因此需要一种自动构建真实世界图像数据集的方法。

Method: 使用多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）协调四个智能体和一个图像优化工具包，根据用户需求自动构建数据集。

Result: 在扩展现有数据集和从头创建新数据集的实验中，DatasetAgent构建的数据集成功用于训练多种视觉模型（分类、检测、分割）。

Conclusion: DatasetAgent能够高效构建高质量的真实世界图像数据集，为视觉任务提供支持。

Abstract: Common knowledge indicates that the process of constructing image datasets
usually depends on the time-intensive and inefficient method of manual
collection and annotation. Large models offer a solution via data generation.
Nonetheless, real-world data are obviously more valuable comparing to
artificially intelligence generated data, particularly in constructing image
datasets. For this reason, we propose a novel method for auto-constructing
datasets from real-world images by a multiagent collaborative system, named as
DatasetAgent. By coordinating four different agents equipped with Multi-modal
Large Language Models (MLLMs), as well as a tool package for image
optimization, DatasetAgent is able to construct high-quality image datasets
according to user-specified requirements. In particular, two types of
experiments are conducted, including expanding existing datasets and creating
new ones from scratch, on a variety of open-source datasets. In both cases,
multiple image datasets constructed by DatasetAgent are used to train various
vision models for image classification, object detection, and image
segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer的模型（7T-Restormer），用于从1.5T或3T T1加权图像合成7T质量的T1图，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 7T MRI具有更高分辨率和对比度，但成本高且稀缺，因此需要一种方法从常规1.5T或3T图像合成7T质量图像。

Method: 使用141例患者数据（1.5T和3T T1W图像及对应的7T T1图），训练并验证7T-Restormer模型，并与ResViT和ResShift模型对比。

Result: 7T-Restormer在1.5T和3T输入下均表现优异，PSNR、SSIM和NMSE指标优于其他模型，且参数更少。

Conclusion: 该方法可从常规1.5T/3T图像高效合成7T质量T1图，使7T MRI的优势更易应用于临床。

Abstract: Purpose: Ultra-high-field 7T MRI offers improved resolution and contrast over
standard clinical field strengths (1.5T, 3T). However, 7T scanners are costly,
scarce, and introduce additional challenges such as susceptibility artifacts.
We propose an efficient transformer-based model (7T-Restormer) to synthesize
7T-quality T1-maps from routine 1.5T or 3T T1-weighted (T1W) images. Methods:
Our model was validated on 35 1.5T and 108 3T T1w MRI paired with corresponding
7T T1 maps of patients with confirmed MS. A total of 141 patient cases (32,128
slices) were randomly divided into 105 (25; 80) training cases (19,204 slices),
19 (5; 14) validation cases (3,476 slices), and 17 (5; 14) test cases (3,145
slices) where (X; Y) denotes the patients with 1.5T and 3T T1W scans,
respectively. The synthetic 7T T1 maps were compared against the ResViT and
ResShift models. Results: The 7T-Restormer model achieved a PSNR of 26.0 +/-
4.6 dB, SSIM of 0.861 +/- 0.072, and NMSE of 0.019 +/- 0.011 for 1.5T inputs,
and 25.9 +/- 4.9 dB, and 0.866 +/- 0.077 for 3T inputs, respectively. Using
10.5 M parameters, our model reduced NMSE by 64 % relative to 56.7M parameter
ResShift (0.019 vs 0.052, p = <.001 and by 41 % relative to 70.4M parameter
ResViT (0.019 vs 0.032, p = <.001) at 1.5T, with similar advantages at 3T
(0.021 vs 0.060 and 0.033; p < .001). Training with a mixed 1.5 T + 3 T corpus
was superior to single-field strategies. Restricting the model to 1.5T
increased the 1.5T NMSE from 0.019 to 0.021 (p = 1.1E-3) while training solely
on 3T resulted in lower performance on input 1.5T T1W MRI. Conclusion: We
propose a novel method for predicting quantitative 7T MP2RAGE maps from 1.5T
and 3T T1W scans with higher quality than existing state-of-the-art methods.
Our approach makes the benefits of 7T MRI more accessible to standard clinical
workflows.

Motivation: 解决MLLMs在空间推理和基础任务中的性能不足问题，无需修改模型参数。

Result: 在POPE和GQA基准测试中，多个MLLMs的性能均得到提升。

Conclusion: 深度感知提示在零训练设置下有效，且方法轻量、模块化，兼容黑盒MLLMs。

Abstract: We introduce ByDeWay, a training-free framework designed to enhance the
performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). ByDeWay uses a novel
prompting strategy called Layered-Depth-Based Prompting (LDP), which improves
spatial reasoning and grounding without modifying any model parameters. It
segments the scene into closest, mid-range, and farthest layers using monocular
depth estimation, then generates region-specific captions with a grounded
vision-language model. These structured, depth-aware captions are appended to
the image-question prompt, enriching it with spatial context. This guides MLLMs
to produce more grounded and less hallucinated responses. Our method is
lightweight, modular, and compatible with black-box MLLMs. Experiments on
hallucination-sensitive (POPE) and reasoning-intensive (GQA) benchmarks show
consistent improvements across multiple MLLMs, validating the effectiveness of
depth-aware prompting in a zero-training setting.

Conclusion: MoSAiC为多模态卫星图像的表示学习提供了更鲁棒和精确的解决方案。

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for learning
transferable representations without the reliance on large labeled datasets.
Its ability to capture intrinsic similarities and differences among data
samples has led to state-of-the-art results in computer vision tasks. These
strengths make CL particularly well-suited for Earth System Observation (ESO),
where diverse satellite modalities such as optical and SAR imagery offer
naturally aligned views of the same geospatial regions. However, ESO presents
unique challenges, including high inter-class similarity, scene clutter, and
ambiguous boundaries, which complicate representation learning -- especially in
low-label, multi-label settings. Existing CL frameworks often focus on
intra-modality self-supervision or lack mechanisms for multi-label alignment
and semantic precision across modalities. In this work, we introduce MoSAiC, a
unified framework that jointly optimizes intra- and inter-modality contrastive
learning with a multi-label supervised contrastive loss. Designed specifically
for multi-modal satellite imagery, MoSAiC enables finer semantic
disentanglement and more robust representation learning across spectrally
similar and spatially complex classes. Experiments on two benchmark datasets,
BigEarthNet V2.0 and Sent12MS, show that MoSAiC consistently outperforms both
fully supervised and self-supervised baselines in terms of accuracy, cluster
coherence, and generalization in low-label and high-class-overlap scenarios.

(CNN)-based methods, while powerful, often suffer from substantial

across diverse populations. This study proposes a training-free segmentation
approach based on keypoint tracking, which integrates keypoint selection with
Lucas-Kanade optical flow. The proposed method achieves a mean Dice similarity
coefficient (DSC) ranging from 0.6 to 0.7, depending on the keypoint selection
strategy, performing comparably to state-of-the-art CNN-based models while
substantially reducing computational demands and enhancing interpretability.
This scalable framework presents a robust and explainable alternative for
muscle segmentation in clinical and research applications.

*Li Li,Yingzhe Peng,Xu Yang,Ruoxi Cheng,Haiyang Xu,Ming Yan,Fei Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于轻量级CLIP（L-CLIP）的嵌入式字幕评价指标L-CLIPScore，用于高效评估字幕质量和训练字幕模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有字幕评价指标效率不足，需要一种轻量且高效的替代方案。

Method: 通过权重复用和矩阵分解压缩CLIP模型，设计多模态相似性调节器（SR）损失进行知识蒸馏。

Result: L-CLIPScore在保持多模态对齐能力的同时，减少了计算资源和时间消耗。

Conclusion: L-CLIPScore作为评价指标高效有效，但训练时需与n-gram指标混合使用以避免失败。

Abstract: We propose a novel embedding-based captioning metric termed as L-CLIPScore
that can be used for efficiently evaluating caption quality and training
captioning model. L-CLIPScore is calculated from a lightweight CLIP (L-CLIP),
which is a dual-encoder architecture compressed and distilled from CLIP. To
compress, we apply two powerful techniques which are weight multiplexing and
matrix decomposition for reducing the parameters of encoders and word embedding
matrix, respectively. To distill, we design a novel multi-modal Similarity
Regulator (SR) loss to transfer more vision-language alignment knowledge.
Specifically, SR loss amplifies the multi-modal embedding similarity if the
given image-text pair is matched and diminishes the similarity if the pair is
non-matched. By compressing and distilling by this novel SR loss, our L-CLIP
achieves comparable multi-modal alignment ability to the original CLIP while it
requires fewer computation resources and running time. We carry out exhaustive
experiments to validate the efficiency and effectiveness of L-CLIPScore when
using it as the judge to evaluate caption quality. We also discover that when
using L-CLIPScore as the supervisor to train the captioning model, it should be
mixed up by an n-gram-based metric and meanwhile analyze why using L-CLIPScore
only will cause fail training.

TL;DR: SGPMIL是一种基于稀疏高斯过程的概率注意力多实例学习框架，通过量化实例注意力的不确定性，提升了预测的可靠性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统注意力多实例学习方法在实例级不确定性量化上的不足，特别是在数字病理学中。

Method: 提出SGPMIL框架，利用稀疏高斯过程学习注意力得分的后验分布，并引入特征缩放以优化性能。

Result: 在多个数字病理学数据集上，SGPMIL在袋级和实例级评估中均表现出色，提升了训练效率和预测质量。

Conclusion: SGPMIL不仅保持了袋级性能，还通过不确定性量化显著提升了实例级预测的可靠性和可解释性。

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) offers a natural solution for settings where
only coarse, bag-level labels are available, without having access to
instance-level annotations. This is usually the case in digital pathology,
which consists of gigapixel sized images. While deterministic attention-based
MIL approaches achieve strong bag-level performance, they often overlook the
uncertainty inherent in instance relevance. In this paper, we address the lack
of uncertainty quantification in instance-level attention scores by introducing
\textbf{SGPMIL}, a new probabilistic attention-based MIL framework grounded in
Sparse Gaussian Processes (SGP). By learning a posterior distribution over
attention scores, SGPMIL enables principled uncertainty estimation, resulting
in more reliable and calibrated instance relevance maps. Our approach not only
preserves competitive bag-level performance but also significantly improves the
quality and interpretability of instance-level predictions under uncertainty.
SGPMIL extends prior work by introducing feature scaling in the SGP predictive
mean function, leading to faster training, improved efficiency, and enhanced
instance-level performance. Extensive experiments on multiple well-established
digital pathology datasets highlight the effectiveness of our approach across
both bag- and instance-level evaluations. Our code will be made publicly
available.

Method: 提出RoundaboutHD数据集，包含40分钟4K分辨率视频，512辆车的标注数据，支持多任务分析。

Result: 提供了车辆检测、单摄像头跟踪、车辆重识别和多摄像头跟踪的基线结果。

Conclusion: RoundaboutHD为多摄像头车辆跟踪研究提供了更接近真实场景的数据支持。

Abstract: The multi-camera vehicle tracking (MCVT) framework holds significant
potential for smart city applications, including anomaly detection, traffic
density estimation, and suspect vehicle tracking. However, current publicly
available datasets exhibit limitations, such as overly simplistic scenarios,
low-resolution footage, and insufficiently diverse conditions, creating a
considerable gap between academic research and real-world scenario. To fill
this gap, we introduce RoundaboutHD, a comprehensive, high-resolution
multi-camera vehicle tracking benchmark dataset specifically designed to
represent real-world roundabout scenarios. RoundaboutHD provides a total of 40
minutes of labelled video footage captured by four non-overlapping,
high-resolution (4K resolution, 15 fps) cameras. In total, 512 unique vehicle
identities are annotated across different camera views, offering rich
cross-camera association data. RoundaboutHD offers temporal consistency video
footage and enhanced challenges, including increased occlusions and nonlinear
movement inside the roundabout. In addition to the full MCVT dataset, several
subsets are also available for object detection, single camera tracking, and
image-based vehicle re-identification (ReID) tasks. Vehicle model information
and camera modelling/ geometry information are also included to support further
analysis. We provide baseline results for vehicle detection, single-camera
tracking, image-based vehicle re-identification, and multi-camera tracking. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机视觉任务中常面临训练数据不足的问题，需要一种有效的方法来提升模型性能。

Method: 使用基于STV特征的弱学习器集成方法，利用STV特征的多尺度纹理表征能力。

Result: 在医学影像任务中，STV学习器表现最佳（AUC=0.87），优于神经网络（AUC=0.75）和Radiomics（AUC=0.79）。

Conclusion: STV特征，尤其是精细尺度的特征，对医学影像中的高摄取预测具有显著效果。

Abstract: Solving computer vision problems through machine learning, one often
encounters lack of sufficient training data. To mitigate this we propose the
use of ensembles of weak learners based on spectral total-variation (STV)
features (Gilboa 2014). The features are related to nonlinear eigenfunctions of
the total-variation subgradient and can characterize well textures at various
scales. It was shown (Burger et-al 2016) that, in the one-dimensional case,
orthogonal features are generated, whereas in two-dimensions the features are
empirically lowly correlated. Ensemble learning theory advocates the use of
lowly correlated weak learners. We thus propose here to design ensembles using
learners based on STV features. To show the effectiveness of this paradigm we
examine a hard real-world medical imaging problem: the predictive value of
computed tomography (CT) data for high uptake in positron emission tomography
(PET) for patients suspected of skeletal metastases. The database consists of
457 scans with 1524 unique pairs of registered CT and PET slices. Our approach
is compared to deep-learning methods and to Radiomics features, showing STV
learners perform best (AUC=0.87), compared to neural nets (AUC=0.75) and
Radiomics (AUC=0.79). We observe that fine STV scales in CT images are
especially indicative for the presence of high uptake in PET.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在层次分类和跨域迁移中存在局限性，限制了模型的灵活性和泛化能力。

Result: 构建MM-5B数据集，验证方法在语义一致性和分类准确性上的提升。

Conclusion: HieraRS有效解决了层次分类和跨域迁移问题，提升了模型的实用性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Hierarchical land cover and land use (LCLU) classification aims to assign
pixel-wise labels with multiple levels of semantic granularity to remote
sensing (RS) imagery. However, existing deep learning-based methods face two
major challenges: 1) They predominantly adopt a flat classification paradigm,
which limits their ability to generate end-to-end multi-granularity
hierarchical predictions aligned with tree-structured hierarchies used in
practice. 2) Most cross-domain studies focus on performance degradation caused
by sensor or scene variations, with limited attention to transferring LCLU
models to cross-domain tasks with heterogeneous hierarchies (e.g., LCLU to crop
classification). These limitations hinder the flexibility and generalization of
LCLU models in practical applications. To address these challenges, we propose
HieraRS, a novel hierarchical interpretation paradigm that enables
multi-granularity predictions and supports the efficient transfer of LCLU
models to cross-domain tasks with heterogeneous tree-structured hierarchies. We
introduce the Bidirectional Hierarchical Consistency Constraint Mechanism
(BHCCM), which can be seamlessly integrated into mainstream flat classification
models to generate hierarchical predictions, while improving both semantic
consistency and classification accuracy. Furthermore, we present TransLU, a
dual-branch cross-domain transfer framework comprising two key components:
Cross-Domain Knowledge Sharing (CDKS) and Cross-Domain Semantic Alignment
(CDSA). TransLU supports dynamic category expansion and facilitates the
effective adaptation of LCLU models to heterogeneous hierarchies. In addition,
we construct MM-5B, a large-scale multi-modal hierarchical land use dataset
featuring pixel-wise annotations. The code and MM-5B dataset will be released
at: https://github.com/AI-Tianlong/HieraRS.

Result: 实验表明FedMeta-GeoLane在几何误差和泛化能力上优于基线方法，显著降低通信开销。

Conclusion: Geo-ORBIT为灵活、上下文感知的基础设施建模奠定了基础，框架已开源。

Abstract: Digital Twins (DT) have the potential to transform traffic management and
operations by creating dynamic, virtual representations of transportation
systems that sense conditions, analyze operations, and support decision-making.
A key component for DT of the transportation system is dynamic roadway geometry
sensing. However, existing approaches often rely on static maps or costly
sensors, limiting scalability and adaptability. Additionally, large-scale DTs
that collect and analyze data from multiple sources face challenges in privacy,
communication, and computational efficiency. To address these challenges, we
introduce Geo-ORBIT (Geometrical Operational Roadway Blueprint with Integrated
Twin), a unified framework that combines real-time lane detection, DT
synchronization, and federated meta-learning. At the core of Geo-ORBIT is
GeoLane, a lightweight lane detection model that learns lane geometries from
vehicle trajectory data using roadside cameras. We extend this model through
Meta-GeoLane, which learns to personalize detection parameters for local
entities, and FedMeta-GeoLane, a federated learning strategy that ensures
scalable and privacy-preserving adaptation across roadside deployments. Our
system is integrated with CARLA and SUMO to create a high-fidelity DT that
renders highway scenarios and captures traffic flows in real-time. Extensive
experiments across diverse urban scenes show that FedMeta-GeoLane consistently
outperforms baseline and meta-learning approaches, achieving lower geometric
error and stronger generalization to unseen locations while drastically
reducing communication overhead. This work lays the foundation for flexible,
context-aware infrastructure modeling in DTs. The framework is publicly
available at https://github.com/raynbowy23/FedMeta-GeoLane.git.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Birkhoff的无数据压缩算法，用于压缩Segment Anything Model (SAM)及其变体，具有高效、通用和紧凑的特点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于SAM及其变体在零样本分割中的卓越表现，压缩这些模型成为迫切需求。

Method: Birkhoff采用超压缩算法，将高维参数向量转化为低维标量，并设计了HyperLinear算子加速推理。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，Birkhoff在压缩时间、压缩比、性能和推理速度上表现优异。

Conclusion: Birkhoff是一种高效、通用的压缩方法，适用于SAM及其变体，无需微调数据即可实现高性能压缩。

Abstract: Due to the excellent performance in yielding high-quality, zero-shot
segmentation, Segment Anything Model (SAM) and its variants have been widely
applied in diverse scenarios such as healthcare and intelligent manufacturing.
Therefore, effectively compressing SAMs has become an increasingly pressing
practical need. In this study, we propose Birkhoff, a novel data-free
compression algorithm for SAM and its variants. Unlike quantization, pruning,
distillation, and other compression methods, Birkhoff embodies versatility
across model types, agility in deployment, faithfulness to the original model,
and compactness in model size. Specifically, Birkhoff introduces a novel
compression algorithm: Hyper-Compression, whose core principle is to find a
dense trajectory to turn a high-dimensional parameter vector into a
low-dimensional scalar. Furthermore, Birkhoff designs a dedicated linear layer
operator, HyperLinear, to fuse decompression and matrix multiplication to
significantly accelerate inference of the compressed SAMs. Extensive
experiments on 18 SAMs in the COCO, LVIS, and SA-1B datasets show that Birkhoff
performs consistently and competitively in compression time, compression ratio,
post-compression performance, and inference speed. For example, Birkhoff can
achieve a compression ratio of 5.17x on SAM2-B, with less than 1% performance
drop without using any fine-tuning data. Moreover, the compression is finished
within 60 seconds for all models.

Abstract: This study presents a hybrid model for classifying handwritten digits in the
MNIST dataset, combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with a multi-well
Hopfield network. The approach employs a CNN to extract high-dimensional
features from input images, which are then clustered into class-specific
prototypes using k-means clustering. These prototypes serve as attractors in a
multi-well energy landscape, where a Hopfield network performs classification
by minimizing an energy function that balances feature similarity and class
assignment.The model's design enables robust handling of intraclass
variability, such as diverse handwriting styles, while providing an
interpretable framework through its energy-based decision process. Through
systematic optimization of the CNN architecture and the number of wells, the
model achieves a high test accuracy of 99.2% on 10,000 MNIST images,
demonstrating its effectiveness for image classification tasks. The findings
highlight the critical role of deep feature extraction and sufficient prototype
coverage in achieving high performance, with potential for broader applications
in pattern recognition.

Conclusion: CoPart通过部分感知设计显著提升了3D生成的细节表现和可控性，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D generation have transitioned from multi-view 2D
rendering approaches to 3D-native latent diffusion frameworks that exploit
geometric priors in ground truth data. Despite progress, three key limitations
persist: (1) Single-latent representations fail to capture complex multi-part
geometries, causing detail degradation; (2) Holistic latent coding neglects
part independence and interrelationships critical for compositional design; (3)
Global conditioning mechanisms lack fine-grained controllability. Inspired by
human 3D design workflows, we propose CoPart - a part-aware diffusion framework
that decomposes 3D objects into contextual part latents for coherent multi-part
generation. This paradigm offers three advantages: i) Reduces encoding
complexity through part decomposition; ii) Enables explicit part relationship
modeling; iii) Supports part-level conditioning. We further develop a mutual
guidance strategy to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion models for joint part
latent denoising, ensuring both geometric coherence and foundation model
priors. To enable large-scale training, we construct Partverse - a novel 3D
part dataset derived from Objaverse through automated mesh segmentation and
human-verified annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate CoPart's superior
capabilities in part-level editing, articulated object generation, and scene
composition with unprecedented controllability.

Conclusion: CLiFTs方法在高效渲染和灵活性方面表现优异，为场景表示和渲染提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper proposes a neural rendering approach that represents a scene as
"compressed light-field tokens (CLiFTs)", retaining rich appearance and
geometric information of a scene. CLiFT enables compute-efficient rendering by
compressed tokens, while being capable of changing the number of tokens to
represent a scene or render a novel view with one trained network. Concretely,
given a set of images, multi-view encoder tokenizes the images with the camera
poses. Latent-space K-means selects a reduced set of rays as cluster centroids
using the tokens. The multi-view ``condenser'' compresses the information of
all the tokens into the centroid tokens to construct CLiFTs. At test time,
given a target view and a compute budget (i.e., the number of CLiFTs), the
system collects the specified number of nearby tokens and synthesizes a novel
view using a compute-adaptive renderer. Extensive experiments on RealEstate10K
and DL3DV datasets quantitatively and qualitatively validate our approach,
achieving significant data reduction with comparable rendering quality and the
highest overall rendering score, while providing trade-offs of data size,
rendering quality, and rendering speed.

Result: 在48个GPU上预训练的Lumos-1性能与EMU3、COSMOS-Video2World和OpenSoraPlan相当。

Conclusion: Lumos-1通过最小化架构修改和高效训练技术，实现了高性能的自回归视频生成。

Abstract: Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) have unified a vast range of
language tasks, inspiring preliminary efforts in autoregressive video
generation. Existing autoregressive video generators either diverge from
standard LLM architectures, depend on bulky external text encoders, or incur
prohibitive latency due to next-token decoding. In this paper, we introduce
Lumos-1, an autoregressive video generator that retains the LLM architecture
with minimal architectural modifications. To inject spatiotemporal correlations
in LLMs, we identify the efficacy of incorporating 3D RoPE and diagnose its
imbalanced frequency spectrum ranges. Therefore, we propose MM-RoPE, a RoPE
scheme that preserves the original textual RoPE while providing comprehensive
frequency spectra and scaled 3D positions for modeling multimodal
spatiotemporal data. Moreover, Lumos-1 resorts to a token dependency strategy
that obeys intra-frame bidirectionality and inter-frame temporal causality.
Based on this dependency strategy, we identify the issue of frame-wise loss
imbalance caused by spatial information redundancy and solve it by proposing
Autoregressive Discrete Diffusion Forcing (AR-DF). AR-DF introduces temporal
tube masking during training with a compatible inference-time masking policy to
avoid quality degradation. By using memory-efficient training techniques, we
pre-train Lumos-1 on only 48 GPUs, achieving performance comparable to EMU3 on
GenEval, COSMOS-Video2World on VBench-I2V, and OpenSoraPlan on VBench-T2V. Code

Motivation: 森林资源保护和决策需要定期森林调查，传统方法耗时耗力，而多光谱LiDAR技术提供了非破坏性、高效的解决方案。

Method: 研究使用HeliALS系统获取高密度多光谱点云数据，并采用三种点云深度学习模型和一种机器学习模型进行森林成分分割。

Abstract: Conservation and decision-making regarding forest resources necessitate
regular forest inventory. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) in laser scanning
systems has gained significant attention over the past two decades as a remote
and non-destructive solution to streamline the labor-intensive and
time-consuming procedure of forest inventory. Advanced multispectral (MS) LiDAR
systems simultaneously acquire three-dimensional (3D) spatial and spectral
information across multiple wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum.
Consequently, MS-LiDAR technology enables the estimation of both the
biochemical and biophysical characteristics of forests. Forest component
segmentation is crucial for forest inventory. The synergistic use of spatial
and spectral laser information has proven to be beneficial for achieving
precise forest semantic segmentation. Thus, this study aims to investigate the
potential of MS-LiDAR data, captured by the HeliALS system, providing
high-density multispectral point clouds to segment forests into six components:
ground, low vegetation, trunks, branches, foliage, and woody debris. Three
point-wise 3D deep learning models and one machine learning model, including
kernel point convolution, superpoint transformer, point transformer V3, and
random forest, are implemented. Our experiments confirm the superior accuracy
of the KPConv model. Additionally, various geometric and spectral feature
vector scenarios are examined. The highest accuracy is achieved by feeding all

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于实例拼图任务的新型MIL方法，通过恢复实例顺序来捕捉空间相关性，优于现有MIL方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MIL方法依赖置换不变性，限制了其在WSI分析中捕捉实例间语义相关性的能力。

Method: 提出学习从随机打乱的实例中恢复顺序的任务（实例拼图问题），并设计了一种基于最优传输理论的Siamese网络解决方案。

Result: 在WSI分类和生存预测任务中，该方法优于现有MIL方法。

Conclusion: 通过捕捉实例间的空间相关性，该方法为WSI分析提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: While multiple instance learning (MIL) has shown to be a promising approach
for histopathological whole slide image (WSI) analysis, its reliance on
permutation invariance significantly limits its capacity to effectively uncover
semantic correlations between instances within WSIs. Based on our empirical and
theoretical investigations, we argue that approaches that are not
permutation-invariant but better capture spatial correlations between instances
can offer more effective solutions. In light of these findings, we propose a
novel alternative to existing MIL for WSI analysis by learning to restore the
order of instances from their randomly shuffled arrangement. We term this task
as cracking an instance jigsaw puzzle problem, where semantic correlations
between instances are uncovered. To tackle the instance jigsaw puzzles, we
propose a novel Siamese network solution, which is theoretically justified by
optimal transport theory. We validate the proposed method on WSI classification
and survival prediction tasks, where the proposed method outperforms the recent
state-of-the-art MIL competitors. The code is available at

### [74] [Depth-Sequence Transformer (DST) for Segment-Specific ICA Calcification Mapping on Non-Contrast CT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08214)
*Xiangjian Hou,Ebru Yaman Akcicek,Xin Wang,Kazem Hashemizadeh,Scott Mcnally,Chun Yuan,Xiaodong Ma*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Depth-Sequence Transformer (DST)的框架，用于解决颅内颈动脉钙化(ICAC)分段量化问题，通过并行概率地标定位任务在1D轴向维度上实现高精度定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D模型在处理ICAC时因分辨率或全局上下文限制无法实现分段量化，而ICAC的位置对预后和手术风险有重要影响。

Method: 将3D挑战重新定义为1D轴向维度的并行概率地标定位任务，提出DST框架处理全分辨率CT体积，预测6个独立概率分布以定位关键解剖地标。

Result: 在100名患者的临床队列中，DST实现了0.1切片的平均绝对误差(MAE)，96%的预测在±1切片容差内，并在公开基准测试中取得最佳结果。

Conclusion: DST是首个实用的自动化分段ICAC分析工具，为研究位置特异性生物标志物在诊断、预后和手术规划中的作用奠定了基础。

Abstract: While total intracranial carotid artery calcification (ICAC) volume is an
established stroke biomarker, growing evidence shows this aggregate metric
ignores the critical influence of plaque location, since calcification in
different segments carries distinct prognostic and procedural risks. However, a
finer-grained, segment-specific quantification has remained technically
infeasible. Conventional 3D models are forced to process downsampled volumes or
isolated patches, sacrificing the global context required to resolve anatomical
ambiguity and render reliable landmark localization. To overcome this, we
reformulate the 3D challenge as a \textbf{Parallel Probabilistic Landmark
Localization} task along the 1D axial dimension. We propose the
\textbf{Depth-Sequence Transformer (DST)}, a framework that processes
full-resolution CT volumes as sequences of 2D slices, learning to predict $N=6$
independent probability distributions that pinpoint key anatomical landmarks.
Our DST framework demonstrates exceptional accuracy and robustness. Evaluated
on a 100-patient clinical cohort with rigorous 5-fold cross-validation, it
achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of \textbf{0.1 slices}, with \textbf{96\%}
of predictions falling within a $\pm1$ slice tolerance. Furthermore, to
validate its architectural power, the DST backbone establishes the best result
on the public Clean-CC-CCII classification benchmark under an end-to-end
evaluation protocol. Our work delivers the first practical tool for automated
segment-specific ICAC analysis. The proposed framework provides a foundation
for further studies on the role of location-specific biomarkers in diagnosis,
prognosis, and procedural planning. Our code will be made publicly available.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Raptor是一种无需训练的医学体积数据嵌入方法，通过随机投影压缩2D基础模型的视觉标记，显著降低计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前在开发体积成像数据（如MRI）的基础模型时，面临高维训练和大数据集构建的挑战。

Method: 利用预训练的2D基础模型提取医学体积的视觉标记，并通过随机投影进行空间压缩。

Result: 在十个医学体积任务中，Raptor性能优于现有方法（提升3%-14%），且无需训练。

Conclusion: Raptor为医学体积的深度学习提供了高效、通用的基础。

Abstract: Current challenges in developing foundational models for volumetric imaging
data, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), stem from the computational
complexity of training state-of-the-art architectures in high dimensions and
curating sufficiently large datasets of volumes. To address these challenges,
we introduce Raptor (Random Planar Tensor Reduction), a train-free method for
generating semantically rich embeddings for volumetric data. Raptor leverages a
frozen 2D foundation model, pretrained on natural images, to extract visual
tokens from individual cross-sections of medical volumes. These tokens are then
spatially compressed using random projections, significantly reducing
computational complexity while retaining semantic information. Extensive
experiments on ten diverse medical volume tasks verify the superior performance
of Raptor over state-of-the-art methods, including those pretrained exclusively
on medical volumes (+3% SuPreM, +6% MISFM, +10% Merlin, +13% VoCo, and +14%
SLIViT), while entirely bypassing the need for costly training. Our results
highlight the effectiveness and versatility of Raptor as a foundation for
advancing deep learning-based methods for medical volumes.

Conclusion: 该系统为联合HDR和超光谱成像提供了高效的解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: We present a metasurface camera that jointly performs high-dynamic range
(HDR) and hyperspectral imaging in a snapshot. The system integrates exposure
bracketing and computed tomography imaging spectrometry (CTIS) by
simultaneously forming multiple spatially multiplexed projections with unique
power ratios and chromatic aberrations on a photosensor. The measurements are
subsequently processed through a deep reconstruction model to generate an HDR
image and a hyperspectral datacube. Our simulation studies show that the
proposed system achieves higher reconstruction accuracy than previous snapshot
hyperspectral imaging methods on benchmark datasets. We assemble a working
prototype and demonstrate snapshot reconstruction of 60 dB dynamic range and 10
nm spectral resolution from 600 nm to 700 nm on real-world scenes from a
monochrome photosensor.

Method: 采用动态视觉传感器和SNN编码器进行事件驱动感知，核心卫星使用SNN解码器进行推理，并通过光学链路直接传输。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在分类任务中达到与现代视觉管道相当的精度，同时能效优于现有轻量级实现。

Conclusion: 神经形态计算在LEO遥感任务中具有高效能分步计算的潜力。

Abstract: Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations increasingly require onboard
intelligence under strict power and communication constraints. This paper
proposes a neuromorphic split computing framework tailored for hierarchical LEO
systems, where edge satellites perform event-driven sensing using dynamic
vision sensors (DVS) and lightweight spiking neural network (SNN) encoders,
while core satellites conduct inference using a powerful SNN decoder. A learned
spike mapping scheme enables direct transmission over optical inter-satellite
links (OISLs) without conventional modulation overhead. Experimental results on
synthetic aerial scene classification demonstrate that the proposed
architecture achieves accuracy on par with modern large vision-based pipelines,
while offering energy efficiency comparable to that of existing lightweight
implementations. These findings highlight the potential of neuromorphic
computing for energy-efficient inter-satellite split computing in LEO remote
sensing missions.

TL;DR: FlowDrag通过结合几何信息改进拖拽编辑，解决了现有方法因忽视整体几何导致的几何不一致问题，并在新基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有拖拽编辑方法仅关注用户定义的点匹配，忽视整体几何，导致编辑结果不稳定或出现伪影。

Method: FlowDrag构建3D网格，通过能量函数指导变形，并将位移投影到2D，结合UNet去噪过程实现精确编辑。

Result: FlowDrag在VFD Bench和DragBench上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FlowDrag通过几何信息提升了拖拽编辑的准确性和一致性，并提供了新的基准测试数据集。

Abstract: Drag-based editing allows precise object manipulation through point-based
control, offering user convenience. However, current methods often suffer from
a geometric inconsistency problem by focusing exclusively on matching
user-defined points, neglecting the broader geometry and leading to artifacts
or unstable edits. We propose FlowDrag, which leverages geometric information
for more accurate and coherent transformations. Our approach constructs a 3D
mesh from the image, using an energy function to guide mesh deformation based
on user-defined drag points. The resulting mesh displacements are projected
into 2D and incorporated into a UNet denoising process, enabling precise
handle-to-target point alignment while preserving structural integrity.
Additionally, existing drag-editing benchmarks provide no ground truth, making
it difficult to assess how accurately the edits match the intended
transformations. To address this, we present VFD (VidFrameDrag) benchmark
dataset, which provides ground-truth frames using consecutive shots in a video
dataset. FlowDrag outperforms existing drag-based editing methods on both VFD
Bench and DragBench.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在图像训练中缺乏多样化的相机-物体关系及对应文本描述，导致其在物体方向、相机视角和镜头捕捉方面表现不佳。

Method: 通过3D资产输入，结合渲染和扩散模型生成逼真图像，并利用大语言模型（LLMs）生成文本提示，创建了包含24万VQA的Ultimate3D数据集。

Result: 在相机-物体关系识别任务中，基于该数据集微调的MLLMs比商业模型平均准确率提高了33.4%。

Conclusion: 提出的数据集和框架为MLLMs的广泛应用提供了支持，代码和基准将公开。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with accurately capturing
camera-object relations, especially for object orientation, camera viewpoint,
and camera shots. This stems from the fact that existing MLLMs are trained on
images with limited diverse camera-object relations and corresponding textual
descriptions. To address this, we propose a synthetic generation pipeline to
create large-scale 3D visual instruction datasets. Our framework takes 3D
assets as input and uses rendering and diffusion-based image generation models
to create photorealistic images preserving precise camera-object relations.
Additionally, large language models (LLMs) are used to generate text prompts
for guiding visual instruction tuning and controlling image generation. We
create Ultimate3D, a dataset of 240K VQAs with precise camera-object
annotations, and corresponding benchmark. MLLMs fine-tuned on our proposed
dataset outperform commercial models by a large margin, achieving an average
accuracy improvement of 33.4% on camera-object relation recognition tasks. Our
code, dataset, and benchmark will contribute to broad MLLM applications.

TL;DR: 论文评估了木卫三（Ganymede）地下海洋流动产生的磁场（OIMF）的强度和可测量性，并探讨了OIMF如何约束海洋流动及内部结构，提出了一种适合的度量方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究目的是评估OIMF的强度和可测量性，并探索其对木卫三海洋流动和内部结构的约束作用。

Method: 通过简化电磁感应（EMI）方程计算OIMF，忽略海洋感应场的对流项和静止感应。

Result: OIMF主要由流动的环形分量与木卫三内部磁场相互作用产生，是可测量的信号，幅度为几纳特斯拉。OIMF可用于识别海洋流动模式并确定海洋厚度。

Conclusion: OIMF是研究木卫三海洋流动和内部结构的有效工具，其测量可提供海洋厚度和流动模式的信息。

Abstract: This paper has two main objectives. First, we assess the strength and
measurability of Ganymede's ocean-induced magnetic field (OIMF) generated by
the flow in the subsurface ocean. Second, we inspect how the OIMF constrains
the ocean flow and Ganymede's internal structure and suggest a suitable metric
for this purpose. We calculate the OIMF by solving the electromagnetic
induction (EMI) equation in the simplified form, where we neglect the
ocean-induced field in the advection term and the motionless induction. We show
that this approach is sufficiently accurate by comparison with the solution of
the full EMI equation. We also demonstrate that the OIMF is predominantly a
stationary signal generated by the interaction of the toroidal component of the
flow with Ganymede's internal field. The contributions to the OIMF due to the
poloidal component of the flow and Jupiter's magnetic field can be neglected as
second-order effects. The stationary OIMF is a measurable quantity with a few
nT amplitude on Ganymede's surface if the ocean is sufficiently thick
(approximately 400 km) and conductive (approximately 5 S/m). In this case, the
specific footprint of the measured OIMF could be used to identify the flow
regime (mode) of the convecting ocean. Additionally, the OIMF can be used to
determine the ocean thickness since the OIMF pattern is shifted towards low
latitudes if the ocean thickness is reduced.

Abstract: We contribute a comprehensive dataset to study user attention and purchasing
behavior on Search Engine Result Pages (SERPs). Previous work has relied on
mouse movements as a low-cost large-scale behavioral proxy but also has relied
on self-reported ground-truth labels, collected at post-task, which can be
inaccurate and prone to biases. To address this limitation, we use an eye
tracker to construct an objective ground-truth of continuous visual attention.
Our dataset comprises 2,776 transactional queries on Google SERPs, collected

(2) rendered SERP screenshots; (3) eye movement data; (4) mouse movement data;
(5) bounding boxes of direct display and organic advertisements; and (6)

Motivation: 现有方法在重建精度、计算成本和验证方面存在问题，主要由于手工标记数据难以获取。

Method: 采用半监督学习框架，从基于最小抖动原则生成的合成数据中学习，并通过适应未标记的人类运动数据迭代优化。

Abstract: This paper introduces a SSSUMO, semi-supervised deep learning approach for
submovement decomposition that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and speed.
While submovement analysis offers valuable insights into motor control,
existing methods struggle with reconstruction accuracy, computational cost, and
validation, due to the difficulty of obtaining hand-labeled data. We address
these challenges using a semi-supervised learning framework. This framework
learns from synthetic data, initially generated from minimum-jerk principles
and then iteratively refined through adaptation to unlabeled human movement
data. Our fully convolutional architecture with differentiable reconstruction
significantly surpasses existing methods on both synthetic and diverse human
motion datasets, demonstrating robustness even in high-noise conditions.
Crucially, the model operates in real-time (less than a millisecond per input
second), a substantial improvement over optimization-based techniques. This
enhanced performance facilitates new applications in human-computer
interaction, rehabilitation medicine, and motor control studies. We demonstrate
the model's effectiveness across diverse human-performed tasks such as
steering, rotation, pointing, object moving, handwriting, and mouse-controlled
gaming, showing notable improvements particularly on challenging datasets where
traditional methods largely fail. Training and benchmarking source code, along
with pre-trained model weights, are made publicly available at

Result: 使用预训练VLMs和LLM时，BLEU得分达46，优于基线方法；轻量级组件方案在无监督设置下得31分，优于现有方法10分。

Conclusion: LoGIC方法在无监督图像描述任务中表现出色，为提升性能提供了新思路。

Abstract: Image captioning is an important problem in developing various AI systems,
and these tasks require large volumes of annotated images to train the models.
Since all existing labelled datasets are already used for training the large
Vision Language Models (VLMs), it becomes challenging to improve the
performance of the same. Considering this, it is essential to consider the
unsupervised image captioning performance, which remains relatively
under-explored. To that end, we propose LoGIC (Lewis Communication Game for
Image Captioning), a Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning game. The proposed
method consists of two agents, a 'speaker' and a 'listener', with the objective
of learning a strategy for communicating in natural language. We train agents
in the cooperative common-reward setting using the GRPO algorithm and show that
improvement in image captioning performance emerges as a consequence of the
agents learning to play the game. We show that using pre-trained VLMs as the
'speaker' and Large Language Model (LLM) for language understanding in the
'listener', we achieved a $46$ BLEU score after fine-tuning using LoGIC without
additional labels, a $2$ units advantage in absolute metrics compared to the
$44$ BLEU score of the vanilla VLM. Additionally, we replace the VLM from the
'speaker' with lightweight components: (i) a ViT for image perception and (ii)
a GPT2 language generation, and train them from scratch using LoGIC, obtaining
a $31$ BLEU score in the unsupervised setting, a $10$ points advantage over
existing unsupervised image-captioning methods.

Motivation: 研究多晶材料在变形过程中的能量存储和耗散机制，特别是扩散辅助的晶界滑动（瞬态扩散蠕变）。

Method: 使用有限元计算，基于简单晶粒形状（2D六边形和3D十四面体），建立瞬态扩散蠕变的参考模型。

Conclusion: 简单模型为实验观测的衰减提供了下限，但实验室实验中还存在其他耗散机制未被模型描述。

Abstract: Polycrystalline materials have a viscoelastic rheology where the strains
produced by stresses depend on the timescale of deformation. Energy can be
stored elastically within grain interiors and dissipated by a variety of
different mechanisms. One such dissipation mechanism is
diffusionally-accommodated/-assisted grain boundary sliding, also known as
transient diffusion creep. Here we detail a simple reference model of transient
diffusion creep, based on finite element calculations with simple grain shapes:
a regular hexagon in 2D and a tetrakaidecadedron in 3D. The linear viscoelastic
behaviour of the finite element models can be well described by a parameterised
extended Burgers model, which behaves as a Maxwell model at low frequencies and
as an Andrade model at high frequencies. The parametrisation has a specific
relaxation strength, Andrade exponent and Andrade time. The Andrade exponent
depends only on the angles at which grains meet at triple junctions, and can be
related to the exponents of stress singularities that occur at triple junctions
in purely elastic models without diffusion. A comparison with laboratory
experiments shows that the simple models here provide a lower bound on the
observed attenuation. However, there are also clearly additional dissipative
processes occurring in laboratory experiments that are not described by these
simple models.

Conclusion: CL3R通过3D预训练框架有效解决了现有方法的局限性，为机器人操作提供了更鲁棒的感知模块。

Abstract: Building a robust perception module is crucial for visuomotor policy
learning. While recent methods incorporate pre-trained 2D foundation models
into robotic perception modules to leverage their strong semantic
understanding, they struggle to capture 3D spatial information and generalize
across diverse camera viewpoints. These limitations hinder the policy's
effectiveness, especially in fine-grained robotic manipulation scenarios. To
address these challenges, we propose CL3R, a novel 3D pre-training framework
designed to enhance robotic manipulation policies. Our method integrates both
spatial awareness and semantic understanding by employing a point cloud Masked
Autoencoder to learn rich 3D representations while leveraging pre-trained 2D
foundation models through contrastive learning for efficient semantic knowledge
transfer. Additionally, we propose a 3D visual representation pre-training
framework for robotic tasks. By unifying coordinate systems across datasets and
introducing random fusion of multi-view point clouds, we mitigate camera view
ambiguity and improve generalization, enabling robust perception from novel
viewpoints at test time. Extensive experiments in both simulation and the real
world demonstrate the superiority of our method, highlighting its effectiveness
in visuomotor policy learning for robotic manipulation.

Conclusion: H2RH-SGS为人类-机器人交接任务提供了一种新的有效表示方法。

Abstract: Learning robot manipulation policies from raw, real-world image data requires
a large number of robot-action trials in the physical environment. Although
training using simulations offers a cost-effective alternative, the visual
domain gap between simulation and robot workspace remains a major limitation.
Gaussian Splatting visual reconstruction methods have recently provided new
directions for robot manipulation by generating realistic environments. In this
paper, we propose the first method for learning supervised-based robot
handovers solely from RGB images without the need of real-robot training or
real-robot data collection. The proposed policy learner, Human-to-Robot
Handover using Sparse-View Gaussian Splatting (H2RH-SGS), leverages sparse-view
Gaussian Splatting reconstruction of human-to-robot handover scenes to generate
robot demonstrations containing image-action pairs captured with a camera
mounted on the robot gripper. As a result, the simulated camera pose changes in
the reconstructed scene can be directly translated into gripper pose changes.
We train a robot policy on demonstrations collected with 16 household objects
and {\em directly} deploy this policy in the real environment. Experiments in
both Gaussian Splatting reconstructed scene and real-world human-to-robot
handover experiments demonstrate that H2RH-SGS serves as a new and effective
representation for the human-to-robot handover task.

Method: 1. 结构上采用层剪枝自蒸馏，保留浅层并蒸馏深层特征；2. 学习上引入模态自适应对比学习损失，区分模态内和模态间负样本。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著减少资源使用，同时保持强性能。

Conclusion: PUMA通过结构和学习优化，高效解决了统一多模态检索问题。

Abstract: As multimedia content expands, the demand for unified multimodal retrieval
(UMR) in real-world applications increases. Recent work leverages multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) to tackle this task. However, their large
parameter size results in high training costs and low inference efficiency. To
address this, we propose PUMA: a Layer-Pruned Language Model for Efficient
Unified Multimodal Retrieval with Modality-Adaptive Learning. Our approach
improves UMR from both structural and learning perspectives. (1) Structurally,
we propose Layer-Pruned Self-Distillation, which prunes MLLMs by keeping only
shallow layers while distilling features from dropped deep layers as teacher
signals. This reduces parameters and preserves representation capability. (2)
On the learning side, we introduce Modality-Adaptive Contrastive Learning Loss
(MAC-Loss), which separates in-batch negatives into harder intra-modality and
easier inter-modality groups based on the target modality, assigning different
temperature strategies to enhance learning efficiency. Experiments show our
method significantly reduces resource usage while maintaining strong
performance.

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 论文研究了社交媒体上金融影响者（finfluencers）的多模态信号对股票推荐的影响，并提出了VideoConviction数据集用于评估多模态和文本模型的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解金融影响者在社交媒体上的多模态信号（如语气、表达方式和面部表情）如何影响股票推荐，以及这些信号是否能被模型有效捕捉。

Method: 构建了包含6000+专家标注的VideoConviction数据集，通过457小时的人工标注工作，对比了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）和文本大语言模型（LLMs）的表现。

Result: 多模态输入提高了股票代码提取的准确性，但模型难以区分投资行为和信念强度。高信念推荐表现优于低信念推荐，但仍不及S&P 500指数基金。反向策略（与推荐相反）年回报率高出6.8%，但风险更高。

Conclusion: VideoConviction数据集为多模态金融研究提供了基准，展示了多模态信号的重要性，但模型仍需改进以更好地捕捉信念强度。

Abstract: Social media has amplified the reach of financial influencers known as
"finfluencers," who share stock recommendations on platforms like YouTube.
Understanding their influence requires analyzing multimodal signals like tone,
delivery style, and facial expressions, which extend beyond text-based
financial analysis. We introduce VideoConviction, a multimodal dataset with
6,000+ expert annotations, produced through 457 hours of human effort, to
benchmark multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and text-based large
language models (LLMs) in financial discourse. Our results show that while
multimodal inputs improve stock ticker extraction (e.g., extracting Apple's
ticker AAPL), both MLLMs and LLMs struggle to distinguish investment actions
and conviction--the strength of belief conveyed through confident delivery and
detailed reasoning--often misclassifying general commentary as definitive
recommendations. While high-conviction recommendations perform better than
low-conviction ones, they still underperform the popular S\&P 500 index fund.
An inverse strategy--betting against finfluencer recommendations--outperforms
the S\&P 500 by 6.8\% in annual returns but carries greater risk (Sharpe ratio
of 0.41 vs. 0.65). Our benchmark enables a diverse evaluation of multimodal
tasks, comparing model performance on both full video and segmented video
inputs. This enables deeper advancements in multimodal financial research. Our
code, dataset, and evaluation leaderboard are available under the CC BY-NC 4.0

### [89] [Visual Semantic Description Generation with MLLMs for Image-Text Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08590)
*Junyu Chen,Yihua Gao,Mingyong Li*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）作为视觉语义解析器的新框架，通过生成视觉语义描述（VSD）来弥合图像和文本模态的差异，提升图像文本匹配性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图像和文本模态在表示上的根本差异（连续高维图像特征与离散结构化文本），实现跨模态对齐。

Method: 结合实例级对齐（融合视觉特征与VSD）和原型级对齐（VSD聚类），增强图像表示的语义表达能力。

Result: 在Flickr30K和MSCOCO上表现显著提升，并展示出在新闻和遥感图像文本匹配任务中的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过VSD框架有效提升图像文本匹配性能，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Image-text matching (ITM) aims to address the fundamental challenge of
aligning visual and textual modalities, which inherently differ in their
representations, continuous, high-dimensional image features vs. discrete,
structured text. We propose a novel framework that bridges the modality gap by
leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as visual semantic parsers.
By generating rich Visual Semantic Descriptions (VSD), MLLMs provide semantic
anchor that facilitate cross-modal alignment. Our approach combines: (1)
Instance-level alignment by fusing visual features with VSD to enhance the
linguistic expressiveness of image representations, and (2) Prototype-level
alignment through VSD clustering to ensure category-level consistency. These
modules can be seamlessly integrated into existing ITM models. Extensive
experiments on Flickr30K and MSCOCO demonstrate substantial performance
improvements. The approach also exhibits remarkable zero-shot generalization to
cross-domain tasks, including news and remote sensing ITM. The code and model
checkpoints are available at https://github.com/Image-Text-Matching/VSD.

### [90] [Barriers in Integrating Medical Visual Question Answering into Radiology Workflows: A Scoping Review and Clinicians' Insights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08036)
*Deepali Mishra,Chaklam Silpasuwanchai,Ashutosh Modi,Madhumita Sushil,Sorayouth Chumnanvej*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究系统回顾了68篇关于医学视觉问答（MedVQA）的文献，并调查了50名临床医生，发现MedVQA在临床工作流中的实际效用有限，主要问题包括数据集和模型的不足、评估指标与临床需求的不匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨MedVQA在临床工作流中的实际应用潜力，识别其挑战和差距，以促进其更好地融入临床实践。

Method: 采用Arksey和O'Malley的范围综述框架，结合文献综述和临床医生调查，分析MedVQA的现状和临床需求。

Result: 研究发现60%的问答对缺乏临床相关性，数据集和模型不支持多视图或多分辨率成像、电子健康记录（EHR）集成或领域知识。临床医生中仅29.8%认为MedVQA高度有用。

Conclusion: MedVQA具有潜力，但需解决多模态分析不足、缺乏患者背景和评估方法不匹配等问题，以实现有效的临床集成。

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) is a promising tool to assist
radiologists by automating medical image interpretation through question
answering. Despite advances in models and datasets, MedVQA's integration into
clinical workflows remains limited. This study systematically reviews 68
publications (2018-2024) and surveys 50 clinicians from India and Thailand to
examine MedVQA's practical utility, challenges, and gaps. Following the Arksey
and O'Malley scoping review framework, we used a two-pronged approach: (1)
reviewing studies to identify key concepts, advancements, and research gaps in
radiology workflows, and (2) surveying clinicians to capture their perspectives
on MedVQA's clinical relevance. Our review reveals that nearly 60% of QA pairs
are non-diagnostic and lack clinical relevance. Most datasets and models do not
support multi-view, multi-resolution imaging, EHR integration, or domain
knowledge, features essential for clinical diagnosis. Furthermore, there is a
clear mismatch between current evaluation metrics and clinical needs. The
clinician survey confirms this disconnect: only 29.8% consider MedVQA systems
highly useful. Key concerns include the absence of patient history or domain
knowledge (87.2%), preference for manually curated datasets (51.1%), and the
need for multi-view image support (78.7%). Additionally, 66% favor models
focused on specific anatomical regions, and 89.4% prefer dialogue-based
interactive systems. While MedVQA shows strong potential, challenges such as
limited multimodal analysis, lack of patient context, and misaligned evaluation
approaches must be addressed for effective clinical integration.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SSR的新微调范式，通过同步自检OCR能力，解决多模态大语言模型在文档图像机器翻译任务中的遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在文档图像任务中表现优异，但在跨模态和跨语言的文档图像机器翻译任务中存在能力遗忘问题。

Method: 提出SSR微调范式，模型在生成翻译文本前先生成OCR文本，利用其单语OCR能力辅助跨语言翻译。

Result: 实验表明SSR能有效缓解灾难性遗忘，提升模型在OCR和DIMT任务上的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SSR方法为多模态大语言模型在复杂任务中的能力平衡提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown strong performance in
document image tasks, especially Optical Character Recognition (OCR). However,
they struggle with Document Image Machine Translation (DIMT), which requires
handling both cross-modal and cross-lingual challenges. Previous efforts to
enhance DIMT capability through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on the DIMT
dataset often result in the forgetting of the model's existing monolingual
abilities, such as OCR. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
fine-tuning paradigm, named Synchronously Self-Reviewing (SSR) its OCR
proficiency, inspired by the concept "Bilingual Cognitive Advantage".
Specifically, SSR prompts the model to generate OCR text before producing
translation text, which allows the model to leverage its strong monolingual OCR
ability while learning to translate text across languages. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate the proposed SSR learning helps mitigate catastrophic
forgetting, improving the generalization ability of MLLMs on both OCR and DIMT
tasks.

TL;DR: M2-Reasoning-7B模型通过创新的数据管道和动态多任务训练策略，解决了MLLMs在动态空间交互上的不足，并在8个基准测试中取得SOTA表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在动态空间交互能力上存在不足，限制了其在实际应用中的表现。

Method: 1. 构建包含29.4万高质量样本的数据管道；2. 采用动态多任务训练策略，结合任务特定奖励。

Result: M2-Reasoning-7B在8个基准测试中达到SOTA，尤其在通用和空间推理领域表现优异。

Conclusion: M2-Reasoning-7B通过数据与训练策略的创新，显著提升了MLLMs的动态空间交互能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), particularly
through Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), have
significantly enhanced their reasoning abilities. However, a critical gap
persists: these models struggle with dynamic spatial interactions, a capability
essential for real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce
M2-Reasoning-7B, a model designed to excel in both general and spatial
reasoning. Our approach integrates two key innovations: (1) a novel data
pipeline that generates 294.2K high-quality data samples (168K for cold-start
fine-tuning and 126.2K for RLVR), which feature logically coherent reasoning
trajectories and have undergone comprehensive assessment; and (2) a dynamic
multi-task training strategy with step-wise optimization to mitigate conflicts
between data, and task-specific rewards for delivering tailored incentive
signals. This combination of curated data and advanced training allows
M2-Reasoning-7B to set a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) across 8 benchmarks,
showcasing superior performance in both general and spatial reasoning domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自然历史收藏中大量未地理参考的生物样本记录问题，现有自动化方法未充分利用地图信息。

Method: 采用网格化方法，在多模态大模型中零样本设置下视觉化空间关系。

Result: 实验显示，该方法在手动标注的小数据集上表现优异，平均距离误差约1公里，优于单模态语言模型和现有工具。

Conclusion: 多模态大模型能有效理解精细地图，提出将其整合到地理参考工作流程的实用框架。

Abstract: Millions of biological sample records collected in the last few centuries
archived in natural history collections are un-georeferenced. Georeferencing
complex locality descriptions associated with these collection samples is a
highly labour-intensive task collection agencies struggle with. None of the
existing automated methods exploit maps that are an essential tool for
georeferencing complex relations. We present preliminary experiments and
results of a novel method that exploits multi-modal capabilities of recent
Large Multi-Modal Models (LMM). This method enables the model to visually
contextualize spatial relations it reads in the locality description. We use a
grid-based approach to adapt these auto-regressive models for this task in a
zero-shot setting. Our experiments conducted on a small manually annotated
dataset show impressive results for our approach ($\sim$1 km Average distance
error) compared to uni-modal georeferencing with Large Language Models and
existing georeferencing tools. The paper also discusses the findings of the
experiments in light of an LMM's ability to comprehend fine-grained maps.
Motivated by these results, a practical framework is proposed to integrate this
method into a georeferencing workflow.

### [94] [Fast and Efficient Merge of Sorted Input Lists in Hardware Using List Offset Merge Sorters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08658)
*Robert B. Kent,Marios S. Pattichis*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: 论文介绍了一种新型硬件合并排序设备LOMS，通过偏移输入列表顺序和最小化排序阶段，显著提高了合并排序的速度和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有合并排序设备如Batcher的Bitonic和Odd-Even合并排序器在设计和效率上存在限制，尤其是在输入列表大小不等时。LOMS旨在解决这些问题。

Method: LOMS采用输入列表偏移排列和交替的列排序与行排序阶段，结合S2MS设备实现高效合并。

Result: LOMS 2-way设备在FPGA上实现了2.63倍的速度提升，且资源占用更少；LOMS 3-way设备也有1.36倍的速度提升。

Conclusion: LOMS设备在速度和资源效率上优于现有技术，适用于FPGA实现，尤其适合输入列表大小不等的情况。

Abstract: A new set of hardware merge sort devices are introduced here, which merge
multiple sorted input lists into a single sorted output list in a fast and
efficient manner. In each merge sorter, the values from the sorted input lists
are arranged in an input 2-D setup array, but with the order of each sorted
input list offset from the order of each of the other sorted input lists. In
these new devices, called List Offset Merge Sorters (LOMS), a minimal set of
column sort stages alternating with row sort stages process the input setup
array into a final output array, now in the defined sorted order. LOMS 2-way
sorters, which merge 2 sorted input lists, require only 2 merge stages and are
significantly faster than Kenneth Batcher's previous state-of-the-art 2-way
merge devices, Bitonic Merge Sorters and Odd-Even Merge Sorters. LOMS 2-way
sorters utilize the recently-introduced Single-Stage 2-way Merge Sorters (S2MS)
in their first stage. Both LOMS and S2MS devices can merge any mixture of input
list sizes, while Batcher's merge sorters are difficult to design unless the 2
input lists are equal, and a power-of-2. By themselves, S2MS devices are the
fastest 2-way merge sorters when implemented in this study's target FPGA
devices, but they tend to use a large number of LUT resources. LOMS 2-way
devices use fewer resources than comparable S2MS devices, enabling some large
LOMS devices to be implemented in a given FPGA when comparable S2MS devices
cannot fit in that FPGA. A List Offset 2-way sorter merges 2 lists, each with
32 values, into a sorted output list of those 64 values in 2.24 nS, a speedup
of 2.63 versus a comparable Batcher device. A LOMS 3-way merge sorter, merging
3 sorted input lists with 7 values, fully merges the 21 values in 3.4 nS, a
speedup of 1.36 versus the comparable state-of-the-art 3-way merge device.
