### [1] [Using Cross-Domain Detection Loss to Infer Multi-Scale Information for Improved Tiny Head Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22677)
*Jisu Kim,Alex Mattingly,Eung-Joo Lee,Benjamin S. Riggan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种优化性能与效率平衡的框架，用于增强微小头部检测与跟踪，通过跨域检测损失、多尺度模块和小感受野检测机制提升效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法计算成本高，导致延迟和资源占用问题，需优化性能与效率的平衡。

Method: 集成跨域检测损失、多尺度模块和小感受野检测机制。

Result: 在CroHD和CrowdHuman数据集上表现优异，提升了MOTA和mAP。

Conclusion: 该框架在拥挤场景中有效提升了微小头部检测与跟踪的性能。

Abstract: Head detection and tracking are essential for downstream tasks, but current
methods often require large computational budgets, which increase latencies and
ties up resources (e.g., processors, memory, and bandwidth). To address this,
we propose a framework to enhance tiny head detection and tracking by
optimizing the balance between performance and efficiency. Our framework
integrates (1) a cross-domain detection loss, (2) a multi-scale module, and (3)
a small receptive field detection mechanism. These innovations enhance
detection by bridging the gap between large and small detectors, capturing
high-frequency details at multiple scales during training, and using filters
with small receptive fields to detect tiny heads. Evaluations on the CroHD and
CrowdHuman datasets show improved Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) and
mean Average Precision (mAP), demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach
in crowded scenes.

### [2] [Frequency-Adaptive Discrete Cosine-ViT-ResNet Architecture for Sparse-Data Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22701)
*Ziyue Kang,Weichuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合深度学习框架，结合自适应DCT预处理模块、ViT-B16和ResNet50主干网络以及贝叶斯线性分类头，用于解决稀有动物图像分类中数据稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀有动物图像分类面临数据稀缺的挑战，许多物种仅有少量标注样本。

Method: 设计了一种自适应频率域选择机制，结合ViT-B16和ResNet50提取全局和局部特征，并通过交叉融合策略整合频率域和空间域特征，最后使用贝叶斯线性分类器进行分类。

Result: 在自建的50类野生动物数据集上，该方法优于传统CNN和固定频带DCT方法，在样本稀缺情况下达到最先进准确率。

Conclusion: 该框架通过自适应频率域选择和混合特征提取，有效解决了稀有动物图像分类中的数据稀缺问题。

Abstract: A major challenge in rare animal image classification is the scarcity of
data, as many species usually have only a small number of labeled samples.
  To address this challenge, we designed a hybrid deep-learning framework
comprising a novel adaptive DCT preprocessing module, ViT-B16 and ResNet50
backbones, and a Bayesian linear classification head. To our knowledge, we are
the first to introduce an adaptive frequency-domain selection mechanism that
learns optimal low-, mid-, and high-frequency boundaries suited to the
subsequent backbones.
  Our network first captures image frequency-domain cues via this adaptive DCT
partitioning. The adaptively filtered frequency features are then fed into
ViT-B16 to model global contextual relationships, while ResNet50 concurrently
extracts local, multi-scale spatial representations from the original image. A
cross-level fusion strategy seamlessly integrates these frequency- and
spatial-domain embeddings, and the fused features are passed through a Bayesian
linear classifier to output the final category predictions. On our self-built
50-class wildlife dataset, this approach outperforms conventional CNN and
fixed-band DCT pipelines, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy under extreme
sample scarcity.

### [3] [HiDream-I1: A High-Efficient Image Generative Foundation Model with Sparse Diffusion Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22705)
*Qi Cai,Jingwen Chen,Yang Chen,Yehao Li,Fuchen Long,Yingwei Pan,Zhaofan Qiu,Yiheng Zhang,Fengbin Gao,Peihan Xu,Yimeng Wang,Kai Yu,Wenxuan Chen,Ziwei Feng,Zijian Gong,Jianzhuang Pan,Yi Peng,Rui Tian,Siyu Wang,Bo Zhao,Ting Yao,Tao Mei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiDream-I1是一个17B参数的开源图像生成基础模型，通过稀疏扩散Transformer和动态MoE架构实现高质量快速生成，并提供三种变体。此外，HiDream-E1支持基于指令的图像编辑，最终形成交互式图像代理HiDream-A1。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有图像生成模型在计算复杂度和推理延迟上的问题，同时提升生成质量。

Method: 采用双流解耦设计的稀疏DiT和动态MoE架构，分阶段处理图像和文本令牌，并通过单流稀疏DiT实现多模态交互。

Result: 实现了高质量图像生成和基于指令的编辑功能，形成全面的图像代理。

Conclusion: HiDream系列模型为多模态AIGC研究提供了高效工具，并开源了代码和模型权重。

Abstract: Recent advancements in image generative foundation models have prioritized
quality improvements but often at the cost of increased computational
complexity and inference latency. To address this critical trade-off, we
introduce HiDream-I1, a new open-source image generative foundation model with
17B parameters that achieves state-of-the-art image generation quality within
seconds. HiDream-I1 is constructed with a new sparse Diffusion Transformer
(DiT) structure. Specifically, it starts with a dual-stream decoupled design of
sparse DiT with dynamic Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, in which two
separate encoders are first involved to independently process image and text
tokens. Then, a single-stream sparse DiT structure with dynamic MoE
architecture is adopted to trigger multi-model interaction for image generation
in a cost-efficient manner. To support flexiable accessibility with varied
model capabilities, we provide HiDream-I1 in three variants: HiDream-I1-Full,
HiDream-I1-Dev, and HiDream-I1-Fast.
  Furthermore, we go beyond the typical text-to-image generation and remould
HiDream-I1 with additional image conditions to perform precise,
instruction-based editing on given images, yielding a new instruction-based
image editing model namely HiDream-E1. Ultimately, by integrating text-to-image
generation and instruction-based image editing, HiDream-I1 evolves to form a
comprehensive image agent (HiDream-A1) capable of fully interactive image
creation and refinement. To accelerate multi-modal AIGC research, we have
open-sourced all the codes and model weights of HiDream-I1-Full,
HiDream-I1-Dev, HiDream-I1-Fast, HiDream-E1 through our project websites:
https://github.com/HiDream-ai/HiDream-I1 and
https://github.com/HiDream-ai/HiDream-E1. All features can be directly
experienced via https://vivago.ai/studio.

### [4] [MIAS-SAM: Medical Image Anomaly Segmentation without thresholding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22762)
*Marco Colussi,Dragan Ahmetovic,Sergio Mascetti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MIAS-SAM是一种用于医学图像异常区域分割的新方法，利用基于补丁的记忆库和SAM编码器提取特征，无需阈值即可获得精确分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学图像异常区域分割问题，避免传统方法中需要手动设定阈值的不便。

Method: 使用基于补丁的记忆库存储正常数据的特征，通过SAM编码器提取嵌入补丁并与记忆库比较生成异常图，最终通过异常图的重心提示SAM解码器完成分割。

Result: 在三个公开数据集（脑MRI、肝脏CT和视网膜OCT）上表现出高精度的异常分割能力，DICE评分验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: MIAS-SAM无需阈值设定即可实现精确的异常分割，适用于多种医学成像模态。

Abstract: This paper presents MIAS-SAM, a novel approach for the segmentation of
anomalous regions in medical images. MIAS-SAM uses a patch-based memory bank to
store relevant image features, which are extracted from normal data using the
SAM encoder. At inference time, the embedding patches extracted from the SAM
encoder are compared with those in the memory bank to obtain the anomaly map.
Finally, MIAS-SAM computes the center of gravity of the anomaly map to prompt
the SAM decoder, obtaining an accurate segmentation from the previously
extracted features. Differently from prior works, MIAS-SAM does not require to
define a threshold value to obtain the segmentation from the anomaly map.
Experimental results conducted on three publicly available datasets, each with
a different imaging modality (Brain MRI, Liver CT, and Retina OCT) show
accurate anomaly segmentation capabilities measured using DICE score. The code
is available at: https://github.com/warpcut/MIAS-SAM

### [5] [Rhetorical Text-to-Image Generation via Two-layer Diffusion Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22792)
*Yuxi Zhang,Yueting Li,Xinyu Du,Sibo Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Rhet2Pix是一个解决修辞语言生成图像问题的框架，通过多步策略优化和双层MDP扩散模块，显著优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像模型在生成修辞语言对应的图像时表现不佳，主要因为模型过于关注字面意义的对齐，而忽略了隐含的语义。

Method: Rhet2Pix将问题建模为多步策略优化，包含双层MDP扩散模块：外层逐步细化子句并生成图像，内层通过奖励稀疏性优化扩散轨迹。

Result: 实验表明，Rhet2Pix在修辞文本到图像生成任务中优于GPT-4o、Grok-3等SOTA模型和学术基线。

Conclusion: Rhet2Pix通过多步优化和双层扩散模块，有效解决了修辞语言生成图像的挑战，为相关领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Generating images from rhetorical languages remains a critical challenge for
text-to-image models. Even state-of-the-art (SOTA) multimodal large language
models (MLLM) fail to generate images based on the hidden meaning inherent in
rhetorical language--despite such content being readily mappable to visual
representations by humans. A key limitation is that current models emphasize
object-level word embedding alignment, causing metaphorical expressions to
steer image generation towards their literal visuals and overlook the intended
semantic meaning. To address this, we propose Rhet2Pix, a framework that
formulates rhetorical text-to-image generation as a multi-step policy
optimization problem, incorporating a two-layer MDP diffusion module. In the
outer layer, Rhet2Pix converts the input prompt into incrementally elaborated
sub-sentences and executes corresponding image-generation actions, constructing
semantically richer visuals. In the inner layer, Rhet2Pix mitigates reward
sparsity during image generation by discounting the final reward and optimizing
every adjacent action pair along the diffusion denoising trajectory. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Rhet2Pix in rhetorical
text-to-image generation. Our model outperforms SOTA MLLMs such as GPT-4o,
Grok-3 and leading academic baselines across both qualitative and quantitative
evaluations. The code and dataset used in this work are publicly available.

### [6] [Cultural Evaluations of Vision-Language Models Have a Lot to Learn from Cultural Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22793)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出视觉语言模型（VLMs）在文化能力评估中存在不足，建议结合视觉文化研究的方法论，提出五个文化维度框架以系统分析VLMs的文化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代视觉语言模型在文化能力评估中表现不佳，缺乏系统分析图像中文化维度的框架。

Method: 基于视觉文化研究（文化研究、符号学、视觉研究）的方法论，提出五个文化维度框架。

Result: 提出了一套系统化的文化维度框架，用于更全面地分析VLMs的文化能力。

Conclusion: 结合视觉文化研究的理论，可以为VLMs的文化能力分析提供更全面的方法论支持。

Abstract: Modern vision-language models (VLMs) often fail at cultural competency
evaluations and benchmarks. Given the diversity of applications built upon
VLMs, there is renewed interest in understanding how they encode cultural
nuances. While individual aspects of this problem have been studied, we still
lack a comprehensive framework for systematically identifying and annotating
the nuanced cultural dimensions present in images for VLMs. This position paper
argues that foundational methodologies from visual culture studies (cultural
studies, semiotics, and visual studies) are necessary for cultural analysis of
images. Building upon this review, we propose a set of five frameworks,
corresponding to cultural dimensions, that must be considered for a more
complete analysis of the cultural competencies of VLMs.

### [7] [One Trajectory, One Token: Grounded Video Tokenization via Panoptic Sub-object Trajectory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23617)
*Chenhao Zheng,Jieyu Zhang,Mohammadreza Salehi,Ziqi Gao,Vishnu Iyengar,Norimasa Kobori,Quan Kong,Ranjay Krishna*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TrajViT提出了一种基于物体轨迹的视频标记化方法，显著减少了冗余标记并提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用时空块标记视频，导致标记过多且计算效率低下，而最佳标记减少策略在相机移动时性能下降且标记减少有限。

Method: 提出基于全景子物体轨迹的标记化方法，并开发TrajViT视频编码器，通过对比学习训练。

Result: TrajViT在多个视频理解任务中显著优于ViT3D，例如在视频-文本检索任务中平均提升6% top-5召回率，标记减少10倍。

Conclusion: TrajViT是首个在多样化视频分析任务中一致优于ViT3D的高效编码器，具有鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Effective video tokenization is critical for scaling transformer models for
long videos. Current approaches tokenize videos using space-time patches,
leading to excessive tokens and computational inefficiencies. The best token
reduction strategies degrade performance and barely reduce the number of tokens
when the camera moves. We introduce grounded video tokenization, a paradigm
that organizes tokens based on panoptic sub-object trajectories rather than
fixed patches. Our method aligns with fundamental perceptual principles,
ensuring that tokenization reflects scene complexity rather than video
duration. We propose TrajViT, a video encoder that extracts object trajectories
and converts them into semantically meaningful tokens, significantly reducing
redundancy while maintaining temporal coherence. Trained with contrastive
learning, TrajViT significantly outperforms space-time ViT (ViT3D) across
multiple video understanding benchmarks, e.g., TrajViT outperforms ViT3D by a
large margin of 6% top-5 recall in average at video-text retrieval task with
10x token deduction. We also show TrajViT as a stronger model than ViT3D for
being the video encoder for modern VideoLLM, obtaining an average of 5.2%
performance improvement across 6 VideoQA benchmarks while having 4x faster
training time and 18x less inference FLOPs. TrajViT is the first efficient
encoder to consistently outperform ViT3D across diverse video analysis tasks,
making it a robust and scalable solution.

### [8] [Fast Trajectory-Independent Model-Based Reconstruction Algorithm for Multi-Dimensional Magnetic Particle Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22797)
*Vladyslav Gapyak,Thomas März,Andreas Weinmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种轨迹无关的模型重建算法，用于二维磁粒子成像（MPI），并通过零样本即插即用（PnP）算法解决了去卷积问题，展示了在不同扫描场景下的强大重建能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MPI重建方法依赖于耗时的校准或特定轨迹的模拟，限制了其灵活性和通用性。本文旨在开发一种不受轨迹限制的模型重建方法。

Method: 采用轨迹无关的模型重建算法，结合零样本PnP算法（带自动噪声估计），利用自然图像训练的降噪器，无需针对MPI数据重新训练。

Result: 在公开的2D FFP MPI数据集和自定义数据上验证了算法，展示了在不同扫描场景下的强大重建能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为通用、灵活的模型重建MPI技术奠定了基础。

Abstract: Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) is a promising tomographic technique for
visualizing the spatio-temporal distribution of superparamagnetic
nanoparticles, with applications ranging from cancer detection to real-time
cardiovascular monitoring. Traditional MPI reconstruction relies on either
time-consuming calibration (measured system matrix) or model-based simulation
of the forward operator. Recent developments have shown the applicability of
Chebyshev polynomials to multi-dimensional Lissajous Field-Free Point (FFP)
scans. This method is bound to the particular choice of sinusoidal scanning
trajectories. In this paper, we present the first reconstruction on real 2D MPI
data with a trajectory-independent model-based MPI reconstruction algorithm. We
further develop the zero-shot Plug-and-Play (PnP) algorithm of the authors --
with automatic noise level estimation -- to address the present deconvolution
problem, leveraging a state-of-the-art denoiser trained on natural images
without retraining on MPI-specific data. We evaluate our method on the publicly
available 2D FFP MPI dataset ``MPIdata: Equilibrium Model with Anisotropy",
featuring scans of six phantoms acquired using a Bruker preclinical scanner.
Moreover, we show reconstruction performed on custom data on a 2D scanner with
additional high-frequency excitation field and partial data. Our results
demonstrate strong reconstruction capabilities across different scanning
scenarios -- setting a precedent for general-purpose, flexible model-based MPI
reconstruction.

### [9] [VidText: Towards Comprehensive Evaluation for Video Text Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22810)
*Zhoufaran Yang,Yan Shu,Zhifei Yang,Yan Zhang,Yu Li,Keyang Lu,Gangyan Zeng,Shaohui Liu,Yu Zhou,Nicu Sebe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VidText是一个新的视频文本理解基准，填补了现有视频理解和OCR基准的不足，支持多语言和分层评估，实验表明当前模型仍有改进空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频理解基准忽视文本信息，OCR基准局限于静态图像，无法捕捉文本与动态视觉的交互。

Method: 提出VidText基准，覆盖多场景和多语言，采用分层评估框架（视频级、片段级、实例级任务）和感知推理任务。

Result: 在18个大型多模态模型上实验，发现模型表现不佳，改进空间大。

Conclusion: VidText填补了视频理解基准的空白，为未来动态环境中的多模态推理研究奠定基础。

Abstract: Visual texts embedded in videos carry rich semantic information, which is
crucial for both holistic video understanding and fine-grained reasoning about
local human actions. However, existing video understanding benchmarks largely
overlook textual information, while OCR-specific benchmarks are constrained to
static images, limiting their ability to capture the interaction between text
and dynamic visual contexts. To address this gap, we propose VidText, a new
benchmark designed for comprehensive and in-depth evaluation of video text
understanding. VidText offers the following key features: 1) It covers a wide
range of real-world scenarios and supports multilingual content, encompassing
diverse settings where video text naturally appears. 2) It introduces a
hierarchical evaluation framework with video-level, clip-level, and
instance-level tasks, enabling assessment of both global summarization and
local retrieval capabilities. 3) The benchmark also introduces a set of paired
perception reasoning tasks, ranging from visual text perception to cross-modal
reasoning between textual and visual information. Extensive experiments on 18
state-of-the-art Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) reveal that current models
struggle across most tasks, with significant room for improvement. Further
analysis highlights the impact of both model-intrinsic factors, such as input
resolution and OCR capability, and external factors, including the use of
auxiliary information and Chain-of-Thought reasoning strategies. We hope
VidText will fill the current gap in video understanding benchmarks and serve
as a foundation for future research on multimodal reasoning with video text in
dynamic environments.

### [10] [IMTS is Worth Time $\times$ Channel Patches: Visual Masked Autoencoders for Irregular Multivariate Time Series Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22815)
*Zhangyi Hu,Jiemin Wu,Hua Xu,Mingqian Liao,Ninghui Feng,Bo Gao,Songning Lai,Yutao Yue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VIMTS是一个基于视觉MAE的框架，用于解决不规则多变量时间序列（IMTS）预测问题，通过特征补全和自监督学习提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IMTS预测因多通道信号未对齐和大量缺失数据而困难，现有方法难以捕捉可靠的时间模式。视觉MAE在稀疏多通道数据处理上的成功激发了将其应用于IMTS的动机。

Method: VIMTS将IMTS沿时间线划分为等间隔特征块，利用跨通道依赖补全缺失值，并通过视觉MAE进行块重建，结合粗到细技术生成预测。

Result: 实验表明VIMTS在性能和少样本能力上表现优异，推动了视觉基础模型在更广泛时间序列任务中的应用。

Conclusion: VIMTS成功将视觉MAE应用于IMTS预测，通过特征补全和自监督学习显著提升了预测能力。

Abstract: Irregular Multivariate Time Series (IMTS) forecasting is challenging due to
the unaligned nature of multi-channel signals and the prevalence of extensive
missing data. Existing methods struggle to capture reliable temporal patterns
from such data due to significant missing values. While pre-trained foundation
models show potential for addressing these challenges, they are typically
designed for Regularly Sampled Time Series (RTS). Motivated by the visual Mask
AutoEncoder's (MAE) powerful capability for modeling sparse multi-channel
information and its success in RTS forecasting, we propose VIMTS, a framework
adapting Visual MAE for IMTS forecasting. To mitigate the effect of missing
values, VIMTS first processes IMTS along the timeline into feature patches at
equal intervals. These patches are then complemented using learned
cross-channel dependencies. Then it leverages visual MAE's capability in
handling sparse multichannel data for patch reconstruction, followed by a
coarse-to-fine technique to generate precise predictions from focused contexts.
In addition, we integrate self-supervised learning for improved IMTS modeling
by adapting the visual MAE to IMTS data. Extensive experiments demonstrate
VIMTS's superior performance and few-shot capability, advancing the application
of visual foundation models in more general time series tasks. Our code is
available at https://github.com/WHU-HZY/VIMTS.

*Xiaojuan Wang,Aleksander Holynski,Brian Curless,Ira Kemelmacher,Steve Seitz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于关键帧的框架，用于生成音乐同步、舞蹈感知的动物舞蹈视频，通过优化关键帧结构和视频扩散模型实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从少量关键帧生成高质量、音乐同步的动物舞蹈视频的挑战。

Method: 将舞蹈合成建模为图优化问题，结合关键帧结构和视频扩散模型生成中间帧。

Result: 仅需6个输入关键帧即可生成长达30秒的舞蹈视频，适用于多种动物和音乐。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且灵活，适用于多样化的舞蹈视频生成需求。

Abstract: We present a keyframe-based framework for generating music-synchronized,
choreography aware animal dance videos. Starting from a few keyframes
representing distinct animal poses -- generated via text-to-image prompting or
GPT-4o -- we formulate dance synthesis as a graph optimization problem: find
the optimal keyframe structure that satisfies a specified choreography pattern
of beats, which can be automatically estimated from a reference dance video. We
also introduce an approach for mirrored pose image generation, essential for
capturing symmetry in dance. In-between frames are synthesized using an video
diffusion model. With as few as six input keyframes, our method can produce up
to 30 second dance videos across a wide range of animals and music tracks.

### [12] [Improving Contrastive Learning for Referring Expression Counting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22850)
*Kostas Triaridis,Panagiotis Kaliosis,E-Ro Nguyen,Jingyi Xu,Hieu Le,Dimitris Samaras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出C-REX，一种基于对比学习的框架，用于解决Referring Expression Counting (REC)任务，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在区分视觉相似但属于不同指代表达的对象时表现不佳，需改进。

Method: 提出C-REX框架，基于监督对比学习，完全在图像空间操作，避免图像-文本对比学习的错位问题，并提供更多负样本。

Result: C-REX在REC任务中MAE提升22%，RMSE提升10%，并在类无关计数中表现优异。

Conclusion: C-REX通过对比学习显著提升REC任务性能，且具有通用性，适用于其他类似任务。

Abstract: Object counting has progressed from class-specific models, which count only
known categories, to class-agnostic models that generalize to unseen
categories. The next challenge is Referring Expression Counting (REC), where
the goal is to count objects based on fine-grained attributes and contextual
differences. Existing methods struggle with distinguishing visually similar
objects that belong to the same category but correspond to different referring
expressions. To address this, we propose C-REX, a novel contrastive learning
framework, based on supervised contrastive learning, designed to enhance
discriminative representation learning. Unlike prior works, C-REX operates
entirely within the image space, avoiding the misalignment issues of image-text
contrastive learning, thus providing a more stable contrastive signal. It also
guarantees a significantly larger pool of negative samples, leading to improved
robustness in the learned representations. Moreover, we showcase that our
framework is versatile and generic enough to be applied to other similar tasks
like class-agnostic counting. To support our approach, we analyze the key
components of sota detection-based models and identify that detecting object
centroids instead of bounding boxes is the key common factor behind their
success in counting tasks. We use this insight to design a simple yet effective
detection-based baseline to build upon. Our experiments show that C-REX
achieves state-of-the-art results in REC, outperforming previous methods by
more than 22\% in MAE and more than 10\% in RMSE, while also demonstrating
strong performance in class-agnostic counting. Code is available at

### [13] [LayerPeeler: Autoregressive Peeling for Layer-wise Image Vectorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23740)
*Ronghuan Wu,Wanchao Su,Jing Liao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LayerPeeler是一种新颖的分层图像矢量化方法，通过渐进式简化策略解决现有工具在遮挡区域处理上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像矢量化工具在处理遮挡区域时生成不完整或碎片化的形状，限制了可编辑性。

Method: 采用自回归剥离策略，结合视觉语言模型构建层图，利用图像扩散模型移除非遮挡层。

Result: 实验表明，LayerPeeler在路径语义、几何规则性和视觉保真度上显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: LayerPeeler通过创新的分层剥离方法，显著提升了图像矢量化的质量和灵活性。

Abstract: Image vectorization is a powerful technique that converts raster images into
vector graphics, enabling enhanced flexibility and interactivity. However,
popular image vectorization tools struggle with occluded regions, producing
incomplete or fragmented shapes that hinder editability. While recent
advancements have explored rule-based and data-driven layer-wise image
vectorization, these methods face limitations in vectorization quality and
flexibility. In this paper, we introduce LayerPeeler, a novel layer-wise image
vectorization approach that addresses these challenges through a progressive
simplification paradigm. The key to LayerPeeler's success lies in its
autoregressive peeling strategy: by identifying and removing the topmost
non-occluded layers while recovering underlying content, we generate vector
graphics with complete paths and coherent layer structures. Our method
leverages vision-language models to construct a layer graph that captures
occlusion relationships among elements, enabling precise detection and
description for non-occluded layers. These descriptive captions are used as
editing instructions for a finetuned image diffusion model to remove the
identified layers. To ensure accurate removal, we employ localized attention
control that precisely guides the model to target regions while faithfully
preserving the surrounding content. To support this, we contribute a
large-scale dataset specifically designed for layer peeling tasks. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that LayerPeeler
significantly outperforms existing techniques, producing vectorization results
with superior path semantics, geometric regularity, and visual fidelity.

TL;DR: CLIPGaussians是一种统一风格迁移框架，支持文本和图像引导的多模态风格化，包括2D图像、视频、3D对象和4D场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高斯泼溅（GS）在3D场景渲染中表现高效，但风格迁移（尤其是复杂风格）仍具挑战性。

Method: 直接在GS基元上操作，作为插件模块集成到现有流程中，无需大型生成模型或从头训练。

Result: 在3D和4D场景中实现颜色与几何的联合优化，视频中保持时间一致性，模型尺寸小。

Conclusion: CLIPGaussians是多模态风格迁移的通用高效解决方案。

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS) has recently emerged as an efficient representation
for rendering 3D scenes from 2D images and has been extended to images, videos,
and dynamic 4D content. However, applying style transfer to GS-based
representations, especially beyond simple color changes, remains challenging.
In this work, we introduce CLIPGaussians, the first unified style transfer
framework that supports text- and image-guided stylization across multiple
modalities: 2D images, videos, 3D objects, and 4D scenes. Our method operates
directly on Gaussian primitives and integrates into existing GS pipelines as a
plug-in module, without requiring large generative models or retraining from
scratch. CLIPGaussians approach enables joint optimization of color and
geometry in 3D and 4D settings, and achieves temporal coherence in videos,
while preserving a model size. We demonstrate superior style fidelity and
consistency across all tasks, validating CLIPGaussians as a universal and
efficient solution for multimodal style transfer.

TL;DR: GeoMan是一种新颖的架构，用于从单目视频中生成准确且时间一致的3D人体几何估计，解决了现有方法在时间一致性和细节捕捉上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要针对单帧图像优化，导致时间不一致和动态细节丢失。GeoMan旨在解决这些问题，同时应对高质量4D训练数据稀缺和人体尺寸准确建模的挑战。

Method: GeoMan结合图像模型和视频扩散模型，首帧通过图像模型估计深度和法线，视频模型专注于细节生成。采用根相对深度表示以保留人体尺寸信息。

Result: GeoMan在定性和定量评估中均达到最先进性能，显著提升了时间一致性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: GeoMan通过创新架构和表示方法，有效解决了3D人体几何估计中的长期挑战。

Abstract: Estimating accurate and temporally consistent 3D human geometry from videos
is a challenging problem in computer vision. Existing methods, primarily
optimized for single images, often suffer from temporal inconsistencies and
fail to capture fine-grained dynamic details. To address these limitations, we
present GeoMan, a novel architecture designed to produce accurate and
temporally consistent depth and normal estimations from monocular human videos.
GeoMan addresses two key challenges: the scarcity of high-quality 4D training
data and the need for metric depth estimation to accurately model human size.
To overcome the first challenge, GeoMan employs an image-based model to
estimate depth and normals for the first frame of a video, which then
conditions a video diffusion model, reframing video geometry estimation task as
an image-to-video generation problem. This design offloads the heavy lifting of
geometric estimation to the image model and simplifies the video model's role
to focus on intricate details while using priors learned from large-scale video
datasets. Consequently, GeoMan improves temporal consistency and
generalizability while requiring minimal 4D training data. To address the
challenge of accurate human size estimation, we introduce a root-relative depth
representation that retains critical human-scale details and is easier to be
estimated from monocular inputs, overcoming the limitations of traditional
affine-invariant and metric depth representations. GeoMan achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations,
demonstrating its effectiveness in overcoming longstanding challenges in 3D
human geometry estimation from videos.

TL;DR: ProbRes是一个基于跳跃扩散的概率残差搜索框架，用于开放世界的自我中心活动识别，通过平衡先验引导的探索和似然驱动的利用，高效导航搜索空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放世界的自我中心活动识别因其无约束性质而具有挑战性，需要模型从部分观察的广阔搜索空间中推断未见活动。

Method: ProbRes整合了结构化常识先验以构建语义一致的搜索空间，利用视觉语言模型（VLMs）自适应细化预测，并采用随机搜索机制高效定位高似然活动标签。

Result: 在多个开放级别（L0-L3）上系统评估ProbRes，其在基准数据集（GTEA Gaze、GTEA Gaze+、EPIC-Kitchens和Charades-Ego）上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: ProbRes不仅提升了开放世界识别的性能，还建立了清晰的分类法，为自我中心活动理解指明了挑战和方法论进展。

Abstract: Open-world egocentric activity recognition poses a fundamental challenge due
to its unconstrained nature, requiring models to infer unseen activities from
an expansive, partially observed search space. We introduce ProbRes, a
Probabilistic Residual search framework based on jump-diffusion that
efficiently navigates this space by balancing prior-guided exploration with
likelihood-driven exploitation. Our approach integrates structured commonsense
priors to construct a semantically coherent search space, adaptively refines
predictions using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and employs a stochastic search
mechanism to locate high-likelihood activity labels while minimizing exhaustive
enumeration efficiently. We systematically evaluate ProbRes across multiple
openness levels (L0--L3), demonstrating its adaptability to increasing search
space complexity. In addition to achieving state-of-the-art performance on
benchmark datasets (GTEA Gaze, GTEA Gaze+, EPIC-Kitchens, and Charades-Ego), we
establish a clear taxonomy for open-world recognition, delineating the
challenges and methodological advancements necessary for egocentric activity
understanding.

TL;DR: 提出首个基于可微分渲染的4D跟踪与建图方法，联合优化相机定位与非刚性表面重建，并引入新数据集和评估协议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决4D-SLAM中因高维优化空间和复杂非刚性运动导致的挑战，填补该领域的研究空白。

Method: 基于高斯表面基元优化深度信号，利用MLP表示变形场，提出相机位姿估计和表面正则化技术。

Result: 实现了准确的表面重建和非刚性变形建模，并提供了合成数据集支持研究。

Conclusion: 为4D-SLAM研究提供了新方法和评估基准，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: We propose the first 4D tracking and mapping method that jointly performs
camera localization and non-rigid surface reconstruction via differentiable
rendering. Our approach captures 4D scenes from an online stream of color
images with depth measurements or predictions by jointly optimizing scene
geometry, appearance, dynamics, and camera ego-motion. Although natural
environments exhibit complex non-rigid motions, 4D-SLAM remains relatively
underexplored due to its inherent challenges; even with 2.5D signals, the
problem is ill-posed because of the high dimensionality of the optimization
space. To overcome these challenges, we first introduce a SLAM method based on
Gaussian surface primitives that leverages depth signals more effectively than
3D Gaussians, thereby achieving accurate surface reconstruction. To further
model non-rigid deformations, we employ a warp-field represented by a
multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and introduce a novel camera pose estimation
technique along with surface regularization terms that facilitate
spatio-temporal reconstruction. In addition to these algorithmic challenges, a
significant hurdle in 4D SLAM research is the lack of reliable ground truth and
evaluation protocols, primarily due to the difficulty of 4D capture using
commodity sensors. To address this, we present a novel open synthetic dataset
of everyday objects with diverse motions, leveraging large-scale object models
and animation modeling. In summary, we open up the modern 4D-SLAM research by
introducing a novel method and evaluation protocols grounded in modern vision
and rendering techniques.

Motivation: 解决现有深度学习方法在图像篡改检测中解释性和定位能力不足的问题，同时克服真实场景中缺乏像素级标注的限制。

Method: 基于WCBnet生成多视角特征图进行粗定位，再结合预训练分割模型（如DeepLab、SegmentAnything和PSPnet）的分割图，通过贝叶斯推理细化定位结果。

Result: 实验证明该方法有效，能够在没有像素级标签的情况下实现篡改区域的定位。

Conclusion: 提出的弱监督方法在图像篡改定位中具有可行性，为实际应用提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The explosive growth of digital images and the widespread availability of
image editing tools have made image manipulation detection an increasingly
critical challenge. Current deep learning-based manipulation detection methods
excel in achieving high image-level classification accuracy, they often fall
short in terms of interpretability and localization of manipulated regions.
Additionally, the absence of pixel-wise annotations in real-world scenarios
limits the existing fully-supervised manipulation localization techniques. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel weakly-supervised approach that
integrates activation maps generated by image-level manipulation detection
networks with segmentation maps from pre-trained models. Specifically, we build
on our previous image-level work named WCBnet to produce multi-view feature
maps which are subsequently fused for coarse localization. These coarse maps
are then refined using detailed segmented regional information provided by
pre-trained segmentation models (such as DeepLab, SegmentAnything and PSPnet),
with Bayesian inference employed to enhance the manipulation localization.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,
highlighting the feasibility to localize image manipulations without relying on
pixel-level labels.

Motivation: 现有PLM仅基于单一模态条件生成蛋白质序列，难以同时满足多模态约束。

Method: 引入AGFM模块动态调整蛋白质特征分布，RCFE模块捕获残基间相互作用，并集成3D结构编码器施加几何约束。

Result: CFP-Gen能够高效生成功能与天然蛋白质相当的新型蛋白质，并在设计多功能蛋白质时具有高成功率。

Conclusion: CFP-Gen为多模态约束下的蛋白质设计提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Existing PLMs generate protein sequences based on a single-condition
constraint from a specific modality, struggling to simultaneously satisfy
multiple constraints across different modalities. In this work, we introduce
CFP-Gen, a novel diffusion language model for Combinatorial Functional Protein
GENeration. CFP-Gen facilitates the de novo protein design by integrating
multimodal conditions with functional, sequence, and structural constraints.
Specifically, an Annotation-Guided Feature Modulation (AGFM) module is
introduced to dynamically adjust the protein feature distribution based on
composable functional annotations, e.g., GO terms, IPR domains and EC numbers.
Meanwhile, the Residue-Controlled Functional Encoding (RCFE) module captures
residue-wise interaction to ensure more precise control. Additionally,
off-the-shelf 3D structure encoders can be seamlessly integrated to impose
geometric constraints. We demonstrate that CFP-Gen enables high-throughput
generation of novel proteins with functionality comparable to natural proteins,
while achieving a high success rate in designing multifunctional proteins. Code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SHTC是一种端到端优化的变换编码框架，用于3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）压缩，通过联合优化3DGS、变换和轻量级上下文模型，显著提升了率失真性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS因其快速高质量渲染而流行，但内存占用大，传输和存储开销高。现有神经压缩方法未采用端到端优化的分析-合成变换，导致性能不佳。

Method: SHTC框架包括使用KLT进行数据去相关的基础层和稀疏编码的增强层，通过ISTA算法重建残差，所有组件可解释且参数少。

Result: SHTC显著提升了率失真性能，同时参数和计算开销最小。

Conclusion: SHTC是首个端到端优化的3DGS压缩框架，通过可解释设计和联合优化实现了高效压缩。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained popularity for its fast and
high-quality rendering, but it has a very large memory footprint incurring high
transmission and storage overhead. Recently, some neural compression methods,
such as Scaffold-GS, were proposed for 3DGS but they did not adopt the approach
of end-to-end optimized analysis-synthesis transforms which has been proven
highly effective in neural signal compression. Without an appropriate analysis
transform, signal correlations cannot be removed by sparse representation.
Without such transforms the only way to remove signal redundancies is through
entropy coding driven by a complex and expensive context modeling, which
results in slower speed and suboptimal rate-distortion (R-D) performance. To
overcome this weakness, we propose Sparsity-guided Hierarchical Transform
Coding (SHTC), the first end-to-end optimized transform coding framework for
3DGS compression. SHTC jointly optimizes the 3DGS, transforms and a lightweight
context model. This joint optimization enables the transform to produce
representations that approach the best R-D performance possible. The SHTC
framework consists of a base layer using KLT for data decorrelation, and a
sparsity-coded enhancement layer that compresses the KLT residuals to refine
the representation. The enhancement encoder learns a linear transform to
project high-dimensional inputs into a low-dimensional space, while the decoder
unfolds the Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA) to reconstruct
the residuals. All components are designed to be interpretable, allowing the
incorporation of signal priors and fewer parameters than black-box transforms.
This novel design significantly improves R-D performance with minimal
additional parameters and computational overhead.

Motivation: 现有CAD重建方法通常仅支持单一输入模态，限制了通用性和鲁棒性。多模态输入可以提升设计的民主化。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：监督微调（SFT）和强化学习（RL）微调，利用在线反馈优化模型。

Result: 在DeepCAD基准测试中，SFT模型优于单模态方法，RL微调后进一步提升了性能，达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: 多模态输入结合RL微调显著提升了CAD重建的性能和通用性。

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a central role in engineering and
manufacturing, making it possible to create precise and editable 3D models.
Using a variety of sensor or user-provided data as inputs for CAD
reconstruction can democratize access to design applications. However, existing
methods typically focus on a single input modality, such as point clouds,
images, or text, which limits their generalizability and robustness. Leveraging
recent advances in vision-language models (VLM), we propose a multi-modal CAD
reconstruction model that simultaneously processes all three input modalities.
Inspired by large language model (LLM) training paradigms, we adopt a two-stage
pipeline: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on large-scale procedurally generated
data, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning using online
feedback, obtained programatically. Furthermore, we are the first to explore RL
fine-tuning of LLMs for CAD tasks demonstrating that online RL algorithms such
as Group Relative Preference Optimization (GRPO) outperform offline
alternatives. In the DeepCAD benchmark, our SFT model outperforms existing
single-modal approaches in all three input modalities simultaneously. More
importantly, after RL fine-tuning, cadrille sets new state-of-the-art on three
challenging datasets, including a real-world one.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏注意力技术在极高稀疏度下无法保持视觉质量，且可能带来计算开销。

Method: Re-ttention通过基于历史softmax分布重塑注意力分数，克服注意力机制中的概率归一化偏移。

Result: 实验表明，Re-ttention仅需3.1%的token，性能优于FastDiTAttn等方法，并在H100 GPU上实现显著延迟降低。

Conclusion: Re-ttention在保持视觉质量的同时，显著降低了计算复杂度和延迟。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have become the de-facto model for generating
high-quality visual content like videos and images. A huge bottleneck is the
attention mechanism where complexity scales quadratically with resolution and
video length. One logical way to lessen this burden is sparse attention, where
only a subset of tokens or patches are included in the calculation. However,
existing techniques fail to preserve visual quality at extremely high sparsity
levels and might even incur non-negligible compute overheads. % To address this
concern, we propose Re-ttention, which implements very high sparse attention
for visual generation models by leveraging the temporal redundancy of Diffusion
Models to overcome the probabilistic normalization shift within the attention
mechanism. Specifically, Re-ttention reshapes attention scores based on the
prior softmax distribution history in order to preserve the visual quality of
the full quadratic attention at very high sparsity levels. % Experimental
results on T2V/T2I models such as CogVideoX and the PixArt DiTs demonstrate
that Re-ttention requires as few as 3.1\% of the tokens during inference,
outperforming contemporary methods like FastDiTAttn, Sparse VideoGen and
MInference. Further, we measure latency to show that our method can attain over
45\% end-to-end % and over 92\% self-attention latency reduction on an H100 GPU
at negligible overhead cost.

Abstract: We investigate whether synthetic images generated by diffusion models can
enhance multi-label classification of protein subcellular localization.
Specifically, we implement a simplified class-conditional denoising diffusion
probabilistic model (DDPM) to produce label-consistent samples and explore
their integration with real data via two hybrid training strategies: Mix Loss
and Mix Representation. While these approaches yield promising validation
performance, our proposed MixModel exhibits poor generalization to unseen test
data, underscoring the challenges of leveraging synthetic data effectively. In
contrast, baseline classifiers built on ResNet backbones with conventional loss
functions demonstrate greater stability and test-time performance. Our findings
highlight the importance of realistic data generation and robust supervision
when incorporating generative augmentation into biomedical image
classification.

Motivation: 传统中值滤波算法存在对图像位深、滤波器核大小和形状的限制，导致实际应用受限。

Method: 提出一种新方法，支持任意位深数据、任意核大小和任意凸核形状（包括圆形）。

Result: 该方法高效且无传统算法的限制，避免了方形核导致的条纹交叉影线伪影。

Conclusion: 新方法解决了传统中值滤波的局限性，为图像处理提供了更灵活的工具。

Abstract: Median filtering is a cornerstone of computational image processing. It
provides an effective means of image smoothing, with minimal blurring or
softening of edges, invariance to monotonic transformations such as gamma
adjustment, and robustness to noise and outliers. However, known algorithms
have all suffered from practical limitations: the bit depth of the image data,
the size of the filter kernel, or the kernel shape itself. Square-kernel
implementations tend to produce streaky cross-hatching artifacts, and nearly
all known efficient algorithms are in practice limited to square kernels. We
present for the first time a method that overcomes all of these limitations.
Our method operates efficiently on arbitrary bit-depth data, arbitrary kernel
sizes, and arbitrary convex kernel shapes, including circular shapes.

Abstract: We propose a unified framework for motion control in video generation that
seamlessly integrates camera movement, object-level translation, and
fine-grained local motion using trajectory-based inputs. In contrast to prior
methods that address these motion types through separate modules or
task-specific designs, our approach offers a cohesive solution by projecting
user-defined trajectories into the latent space of pre-trained image-to-video
generation models via a lightweight motion injector. Users can specify
keypoints and their motion paths to control localized deformations, entire
object motion, virtual camera dynamics, or combinations of these. The injected
trajectory signals guide the generative process to produce temporally
consistent and semantically aligned motion sequences. Our framework
demonstrates superior performance across multiple video motion control tasks,
including stylized motion effects (e.g., motion brushes), dynamic viewpoint
changes, and precise local motion manipulation. Experiments show that our
method provides significantly better controllability and visual quality
compared to prior approaches and commercial solutions, while remaining broadly
compatible with various state-of-the-art video generation backbones. Project

Method: 构建了一个包含150个Minecraft位置的导航视频数据集（20百万帧），采用课程设计逐步增加序列长度，并评估了四种世界模型基线。

Result: 提供了可扩展的数据收集流程和开源数据集，支持未来研究。

Conclusion: 该数据集填补了空间一致性学习的空白，为世界模型的发展提供了重要资源。

Abstract: The ability to simulate the world in a spatially consistent manner is a
crucial requirements for effective world models. Such a model enables
high-quality visual generation, and also ensures the reliability of world
models for downstream tasks such as simulation and planning. Designing a memory
module is a crucial component for addressing spatial consistency: such a model
must not only retain long-horizon observational information, but also enables
the construction of explicit or implicit internal spatial representations.
However, there are no dataset designed to promote the development of memory
modules by explicitly enforcing spatial consistency constraints. Furthermore,
most existing benchmarks primarily emphasize visual coherence or generation
quality, neglecting the requirement of long-range spatial consistency. To
bridge this gap, we construct a dataset and corresponding benchmark by sampling
150 distinct locations within the open-world environment of Minecraft,
collecting about 250 hours (20 million frames) of loop-based navigation videos
with actions. Our dataset follows a curriculum design of sequence lengths,
allowing models to learn spatial consistency on increasingly complex navigation
trajectories. Furthermore, our data collection pipeline is easily extensible to
new Minecraft environments and modules. Four representative world model
baselines are evaluated on our benchmark. Dataset, benchmark, and code are
open-sourced to support future research.

Result: 显著提高了高度动态人体运动序列的结构稳定性和外观一致性。

Conclusion: 提出的数据集和方法有效提升了复杂人体运动图像动画的生成质量。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved conditional
video generation, particularly in the pose-guided human image animation task.
Although existing methods are capable of generating high-fidelity and
time-consistent animation sequences in regular motions and static scenes, there
are still obvious limitations when facing complex human body motions
(Hypermotion) that contain highly dynamic, non-standard motions, and the lack
of a high-quality benchmark for evaluation of complex human motion animations.
To address this challenge, we introduce the \textbf{Open-HyperMotionX Dataset}
and \textbf{HyperMotionX Bench}, which provide high-quality human pose
annotations and curated video clips for evaluating and improving pose-guided
human image animation models under complex human motion conditions.
Furthermore, we propose a simple yet powerful DiT-based video generation
baseline and design spatial low-frequency enhanced RoPE, a novel module that
selectively enhances low-frequency spatial feature modeling by introducing
learnable frequency scaling. Our method significantly improves structural
stability and appearance consistency in highly dynamic human motion sequences.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our dataset and proposed
approach in advancing the generation quality of complex human motion image
animations. Code and dataset will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在真实场景中，获取精确的相机姿态具有挑战性，导致噪声姿态估计和几何错位，影响了3D高斯溅射的效果。

Method: SHARE通过构建姿态感知的规范体积表示，整合多视角信息，减少姿态不准确带来的错位；同时采用锚对齐的高斯预测优化局部几何。

Result: 在多样化真实数据集上的实验表明，SHARE在无需姿态的情况下实现了鲁棒的高斯溅射性能。

Conclusion: SHARE通过创新的姿态无关方法，显著提升了3D高斯溅射在姿态不准确场景下的表现。

Abstract: While generalizable 3D Gaussian splatting enables efficient, high-quality
rendering of unseen scenes, it heavily depends on precise camera poses for
accurate geometry. In real-world scenarios, obtaining accurate poses is
challenging, leading to noisy pose estimates and geometric misalignments. To
address this, we introduce SHARE, a pose-free, feed-forward Gaussian splatting
framework that overcomes these ambiguities by joint shape and camera rays
estimation. Instead of relying on explicit 3D transformations, SHARE builds a
pose-aware canonical volume representation that seamlessly integrates
multi-view information, reducing misalignment caused by inaccurate pose
estimates. Additionally, anchor-aligned Gaussian prediction enhances scene
reconstruction by refining local geometry around coarse anchors, allowing for
more precise Gaussian placement. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world
datasets show that our method achieves robust performance in pose-free
generalizable Gaussian splatting.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的多对象视频生成方法，利用扩散模型和大型语言模型（LLM）的开放世界知识，显著提升了多对象生成的动态性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散基文本到视频（T2V）模型在多对象生成中面临挑战，如对象交互不准确、对象特征混淆等。

Method: 使用LLM作为对象轨迹的“导演”，通过噪声重新初始化和注意力机制优化，实现多对象的精确控制和特征分离。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在运动动态和对象生成准确性上提升了42%，同时保持了高保真度和运动平滑性。

Conclusion: 该方法为多对象视频生成提供了一种高效且无需额外训练的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based text-to-video (T2V) models have
demonstrated remarkable progress, but these models still face challenges in
generating videos with multiple objects. Most models struggle with accurately
capturing complex object interactions, often treating some objects as static
background elements and limiting their movement. In addition, they often fail
to generate multiple distinct objects as specified in the prompt, resulting in
incorrect generations or mixed features across objects. In this paper, we
present a novel training-free approach for multi-object video generation that
leverages the open world knowledge of diffusion models and large language
models (LLMs). We use an LLM as the ``director'' of object trajectories, and
apply the trajectories through noise re-initialization to achieve precise
control of realistic movements. We further refine the generation process by
manipulating the attention mechanism to better capture object-specific features
and motion patterns, and prevent cross-object feature interference. Extensive
experiments validate the effectiveness of our training free approach in
significantly enhancing the multi-object generation capabilities of existing
video diffusion models, resulting in 42% absolute improvement in motion
dynamics and object generation accuracy, while also maintaining high fidelity
and motion smoothness.

Motivation: 解决低资源语言（如匈牙利语）在文档VQA任务中缺乏训练和评估数据的问题。

Method: 通过人工和合成方法从Common Crawl中筛选和去重数据，构建高质量数据集。

Result: 微调Llama 3.2 11B Instruct模型后，在HuDocVQA上的准确率提高了7.2%。

Conclusion: 数据集和代码将公开，以促进多语言DocVQA的研究。

Abstract: Modern VLMs have achieved near-saturation accuracy in English document visual
question-answering (VQA). However, this task remains challenging in lower
resource languages due to a dearth of suitable training and evaluation data. In
this paper we present scalable methods for curating such datasets by focusing
on Hungarian, approximately the 17th highest resource language on the internet.
Specifically, we present HuDocVQA and HuDocVQA-manual, document VQA datasets
that modern VLMs significantly underperform on compared to English DocVQA.
HuDocVQA-manual is a small manually curated dataset based on Hungarian
documents from Common Crawl, while HuDocVQA is a larger synthetically generated
VQA data set from the same source. We apply multiple rounds of quality
filtering and deduplication to HuDocVQA in order to match human-level quality
in this dataset. We also present HuCCPDF, a dataset of 117k pages from
Hungarian Common Crawl PDFs along with their transcriptions, which can be used
for training a model for Hungarian OCR. To validate the quality of our
datasets, we show how finetuning on a mixture of these datasets can improve
accuracy on HuDocVQA for Llama 3.2 11B Instruct by +7.2%. Our datasets and code
will be released to the public to foster further research in multilingual
DocVQA.

Conclusion: SeG-SR通过引入语义知识，显著提升了遥感图像超分辨率的效果，具有广泛的适用性和推广价值。

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) remote sensing imagery plays a vital role in a wide
range of applications, including urban planning and environmental monitoring.
However, due to limitations in sensors and data transmission links, the images
acquired in practice often suffer from resolution degradation. Remote Sensing
Image Super-Resolution (RSISR) aims to reconstruct HR images from
low-resolution (LR) inputs, providing a cost-effective and efficient
alternative to direct HR image acquisition. Existing RSISR methods primarily
focus on low-level characteristics in pixel space, while neglecting the
high-level understanding of remote sensing scenes. This may lead to
semantically inconsistent artifacts in the reconstructed results. Motivated by
this observation, our work aims to explore the role of high-level semantic
knowledge in improving RSISR performance. We propose a Semantic-Guided
Super-Resolution framework, SeG-SR, which leverages Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) to extract semantic knowledge from input images and uses it to guide the
super resolution (SR) process. Specifically, we first design a Semantic Feature
Extraction Module (SFEM) that utilizes a pretrained VLM to extract semantic
knowledge from remote sensing images. Next, we propose a Semantic Localization
Module (SLM), which derives a series of semantic guidance from the extracted
semantic knowledge. Finally, we develop a Learnable Modulation Module (LMM)
that uses semantic guidance to modulate the features extracted by the SR
network, effectively incorporating high-level scene understanding into the SR
pipeline. We validate the effectiveness and generalizability of SeG-SR through
extensive experiments: SeG-SR achieves state-of-the-art performance on two
datasets and consistently delivers performance improvements across various SR
architectures. Codes can be found at https://github.com/Mr-Bamboo/SeG-SR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的空间-时间关节密度（STJD）测量方法，用于量化骨骼序列中动态与静态关节的交互作用，并通过STJD-CL和STJD-MP方法提升自监督学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法主要关注骨骼序列的动态特征，而忽略了动态与静态关节交互的判别潜力。本文旨在挖掘这种潜力以改进动作分类。

Method: 提出STJD测量方法，识别关键关节（prime joints），并设计STJD-CL对比学习策略和STJD-MP重建框架。

Result: 在NTU RGB+D 60、120和PKUMMD数据集上表现优异，NTU RGB+D 120上分别提升3.5和3.6个百分点。

Conclusion: STJD方法有效利用了动态与静态关节的交互，显著提升了动作分类性能。

Abstract: Traditional approaches in unsupervised or self supervised learning for
skeleton-based action classification have concentrated predominantly on the
dynamic aspects of skeletal sequences. Yet, the intricate interaction between
the moving and static elements of the skeleton presents a rarely tapped
discriminative potential for action classification. This paper introduces a
novel measurement, referred to as spatial-temporal joint density (STJD), to
quantify such interaction. Tracking the evolution of this density throughout an
action can effectively identify a subset of discriminative moving and/or static
joints termed "prime joints" to steer self-supervised learning. A new
contrastive learning strategy named STJD-CL is proposed to align the
representation of a skeleton sequence with that of its prime joints while
simultaneously contrasting the representations of prime and nonprime joints. In
addition, a method called STJD-MP is developed by integrating it with a
reconstruction-based framework for more effective learning. Experimental
evaluations on the NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and PKUMMD datasets in various
downstream tasks demonstrate that the proposed STJD-CL and STJD-MP improved
performance, particularly by 3.5 and 3.6 percentage points over the
state-of-the-art contrastive methods on the NTU RGB+D 120 dataset using X-sub
and X-set evaluations, respectively.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于分层细粒度标签比例学习（LHFGLP）的框架，用于隐私敏感的细粒度视觉分类任务，无需实例级标签，仅需包级标签即可高效训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有细粒度视觉分类方法依赖实例级标签，不适用于隐私敏感场景（如医学图像分析），因此需要一种无需直接访问实例标签的方法。

Method: 提出LHFGLP框架，结合分层稀疏字典学习和分层比例损失，通过包级标签实现渐进式特征细化。

Result: 在三个细粒度数据集上的实验表明，LHFGLP优于现有基于标签比例学习的方法。

Conclusion: LHFGLP为隐私保护下的细粒度分类提供了有效解决方案，并计划公开代码和数据集以促进研究。

Abstract: In recent years, Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) has achieved
impressive recognition accuracy, despite minimal inter-class variations.
However, existing methods heavily rely on instance-level labels, making them
impractical in privacy-sensitive scenarios such as medical image analysis. This
paper aims to enable accurate fine-grained recognition without direct access to
instance labels. To achieve this, we leverage the Learning from Label
Proportions (LLP) paradigm, which requires only bag-level labels for efficient
training. Unlike existing LLP-based methods, our framework explicitly exploits
the hierarchical nature of fine-grained datasets, enabling progressive feature
granularity refinement and improving classification accuracy. We propose
Learning from Hierarchical Fine-Grained Label Proportions (LHFGLP), a framework
that incorporates Unrolled Hierarchical Fine-Grained Sparse Dictionary
Learning, transforming handcrafted iterative approximation into learnable
network optimization. Additionally, our proposed Hierarchical Proportion Loss
provides hierarchical supervision, further enhancing classification
performance. Experiments on three widely-used fine-grained datasets, structured
in a bag-based manner, demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms
existing LLP-based methods. We will release our code and datasets to foster
further research in privacy-preserving fine-grained classification.

Result: MaxViT在HAM10000数据集中表现最佳（AVG=87.03%），ConvNeXt_L在FL模型中F1-score达83.98%，SVM提升Swin Transformer系列性能约2%。

Conclusion: 改进的CLIP变体和联邦学习技术有效解决了医学图像分类中的数据隐私和泛化问题，传统机器学习方法进一步提升了性能。

Abstract: Deep models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision
transformer (ViT), demonstrate remarkable performance in image classification.
However, those deep models require large data to fine-tune, which is
impractical in the medical domain due to the data privacy issue. Furthermore,
despite the feasible performance of contrastive language image pre-training
(CLIP) in the natural domain, the potential of CLIP has not been fully
investigated in the medical field. To face these challenges, we considered
three scenarios: 1) we introduce a novel CLIP variant using four CNNs and eight
ViTs as image encoders for the classification of brain cancer and skin cancer,
2) we combine 12 deep models with two federated learning techniques to protect
data privacy, and 3) we involve traditional machine learning (ML) methods to
improve the generalization ability of those deep models in unseen domain data.
The experimental results indicate that maxvit shows the highest averaged (AVG)
test metrics (AVG = 87.03\%) in HAM10000 dataset with multimodal learning,
while convnext\_l demonstrates remarkable test with an F1-score of 83.98\%
compared to swin\_b with 81.33\% in FL model. Furthermore, the use of support
vector machine (SVM) can improve the overall test metrics with AVG of $\sim
2\%$ for swin transformer series in ISIC2018. Our codes are available at

Motivation: 探索统一视觉语言模型（VLMs）中理解和生成任务的相互增强假设，填补现有研究的空白。

Result: 混合数据训练带来相互增强效果，多模态对齐提升泛化能力，生成任务知识可迁移至理解任务。

Conclusion: 统一理解和生成任务对VLMs至关重要，为模型设计和优化提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Recent advancements in unified vision-language models (VLMs), which integrate
both visual understanding and generation capabilities, have attracted
significant attention. The underlying hypothesis is that a unified architecture
with mixed training on both understanding and generation tasks can enable
mutual enhancement between understanding and generation. However, this
hypothesis remains underexplored in prior works on unified VLMs. To address
this gap, this paper systematically investigates the generalization across
understanding and generation tasks in unified VLMs. Specifically, we design a
dataset closely aligned with real-world scenarios to facilitate extensive
experiments and quantitative evaluations. We evaluate multiple unified VLM
architectures to validate our findings. Our key findings are as follows. First,
unified VLMs trained with mixed data exhibit mutual benefits in understanding
and generation tasks across various architectures, and this mutual benefits can
scale up with increased data. Second, better alignment between multimodal input
and output spaces will lead to better generalization. Third, the knowledge
acquired during generation tasks can transfer to understanding tasks, and this
cross-task generalization occurs within the base language model, beyond
modality adapters. Our findings underscore the critical necessity of unifying
understanding and generation in VLMs, offering valuable insights for the design
and optimization of unified VLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在压缩语义特征时牺牲了表达能力，且像素级预测导致冗余，增加了内存开销。

Method: 采用双场语义表示（粗粒度特征场和细粒度特征场）和选择性高斯机制，消除冗余高斯。

Result: 实验显示参数减少60%，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SpatialSplat通过更紧凑的高斯表示，实现了高效且精确的语义3D重建。

Abstract: A major breakthrough in 3D reconstruction is the feedforward paradigm to
generate pixel-wise 3D points or Gaussian primitives from sparse, unposed
images. To further incorporate semantics while avoiding the significant memory
and storage costs of high-dimensional semantic features, existing methods
extend this paradigm by associating each primitive with a compressed semantic
feature vector. However, these methods have two major limitations: (a) the
naively compressed feature compromises expressiveness, affecting the model's
ability to capture fine-grained semantics, and (b) the pixel-wise primitive
prediction introduces redundancy in overlapping areas, causing unnecessary
memory overhead. To this end, we introduce \textbf{SpatialSplat}, a feedforward
framework that produces redundancy-aware Gaussians and capitalizes on a
dual-field semantic representation. Particularly, with the insight that
primitives within the same instance exhibit high semantic consistency, we
decompose the semantic representation into a coarse feature field that encodes
uncompressed semantics with minimal primitives, and a fine-grained yet
low-dimensional feature field that captures detailed inter-instance
relationships. Moreover, we propose a selective Gaussian mechanism, which
retains only essential Gaussians in the scene, effectively eliminating
redundant primitives. Our proposed Spatialsplat learns accurate semantic
information and detailed instances prior with more compact 3D Gaussians, making
semantic 3D reconstruction more applicable. We conduct extensive experiments to
evaluate our method, demonstrating a remarkable 60\% reduction in scene
representation parameters while achieving superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods. The code will be made available for future
investigation.

Result: 构建了GQA-MSCG数据集，实验证明所提框架有效提升了模型的MSCG能力。

Conclusion: 论文为多源组合泛化问题提供了新的解决方案，并公开了数据集以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Compositional generalization is the ability of generalizing novel
compositions from seen primitives, and has received much attention in
vision-and-language (V\&L) recently. Due to the multi-modal nature of V\&L
tasks, the primitives composing compositions source from different modalities,
resulting in multi-sourced novel compositions. However, the generalization
ability over multi-sourced novel compositions, \textit{i.e.}, multi-sourced
compositional generalization (MSCG) remains unexplored. In this paper, we
explore MSCG in the context of visual question answering (VQA), and propose a
retrieval-augmented training framework to enhance the MSCG ability of VQA
models by learning unified representations for primitives from different
modalities. Specifically, semantically equivalent primitives are retrieved for
each primitive in the training samples, and the retrieved features are
aggregated with the original primitive to refine the model. This process helps
the model learn consistent representations for the same semantic primitives
across different modalities. To evaluate the MSCG ability of VQA models, we
construct a new GQA-MSCG dataset based on the GQA dataset, in which samples
include three types of novel compositions composed of primitives from different
modalities. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
framework. We release GQA-MSCG at https://github.com/NeverMoreLCH/MSCG.

Conclusion: \method通过融合先验和迭代细化，有效解决了部分观测下的3D重建问题，尤其在不可见区域表现优异。

Abstract: Generative 3D reconstruction shows strong potential in incomplete
observations. While sparse-view and single-image reconstruction are
well-researched, partial observation remains underexplored. In this context,
dense views are accessible only from a specific angular range, with other
perspectives remaining inaccessible. This task presents two main challenges:
(i) limited View Range: observations confined to a narrow angular scope prevent
effective traditional interpolation techniques that require evenly distributed
perspectives. (ii) inconsistent Generation: views created for invisible regions
often lack coherence with both visible regions and each other, compromising
reconstruction consistency. To address these challenges, we propose \method, a
novel training-free approach that integrates the local dense observations and
multi-source priors for reconstruction. Our method introduces a fusion-based
strategy to effectively align these priors in DDIM sampling, thereby generating
multi-view consistent images to supervise invisible views. We further design an
iterative refinement strategy, which uses the geometric structures of the
object to enhance reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments on multiple
datasets show the superiority of our method over SOTAs, especially in invisible
regions.

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优于现有模型，且参数和计算资源需求更低。

Conclusion: URWKV模型通过多状态感知和动态融合，显著提升了低光图像处理的效果和效率。

Abstract: Existing low-light image enhancement (LLIE) and joint LLIE and deblurring
(LLIE-deblur) models have made strides in addressing predefined degradations,
yet they are often constrained by dynamically coupled degradations. To address
these challenges, we introduce a Unified Receptance Weighted Key Value (URWKV)
model with multi-state perspective, enabling flexible and effective degradation
restoration for low-light images. Specifically, we customize the core URWKV
block to perceive and analyze complex degradations by leveraging multiple
intra- and inter-stage states. First, inspired by the pupil mechanism in the
human visual system, we propose Luminance-adaptive Normalization (LAN) that
adjusts normalization parameters based on rich inter-stage states, allowing for
adaptive, scene-aware luminance modulation. Second, we aggregate multiple
intra-stage states through exponential moving average approach, effectively
capturing subtle variations while mitigating information loss inherent in the
single-state mechanism. To reduce the degradation effects commonly associated
with conventional skip connections, we propose the State-aware Selective Fusion
(SSF) module, which dynamically aligns and integrates multi-state features
across encoder stages, selectively fusing contextual information. In comparison
to state-of-the-art models, our URWKV model achieves superior performance on
various benchmarks, while requiring significantly fewer parameters and
computational resources.

Abstract: Lightweight semantic segmentation is essential for many downstream vision
tasks. Unfortunately, existing methods often struggle to balance efficiency and
performance due to the complexity of feature modeling. Many of these existing
approaches are constrained by rigid architectures and implicit representation
learning, often characterized by parameter-heavy designs and a reliance on
computationally intensive Vision Transformer-based frameworks. In this work, we
introduce an efficient paradigm by synergizing explicit and implicit modeling
to balance computational efficiency with representational fidelity. Our method
combines well-defined Cartesian directions with explicitly modeled views and
implicitly inferred intermediate representations, efficiently capturing global
dependencies through a nested attention mechanism. Extensive experiments on
challenging datasets, including ADE20K, CityScapes, Pascal Context, and
COCO-Stuff, demonstrate that LeMoRe strikes an effective balance between
performance and efficiency.

learning-based Visual image Enhancement (CURVE). CURVE employs a simple image
processing module which adjusts global image tone based on B\'ezier curve and
estimates its processing parameters iteratively. The estimator is trained by
reinforcement learning with rewards designed using CLIP text embeddings.
Experiments on low-light and multi-exposure datasets demonstrate the
performance of CURVE in terms of enhancement quality and processing speed

Conclusion: EAD框架有效解决了EEG信号分类中的设备依赖问题，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: While electroencephalography (EEG) has been a popular modality for neural
decoding, it often involves task specific acquisition of the EEG data. This
poses challenges for the development of a unified pipeline to learn embeddings
for various EEG signal classification, which is often involved in various
decoding tasks. Traditionally, EEG classification involves the step of signal
preprocessing and the use of deep learning techniques, which are highly
dependent on the number of EEG channels in each sample. However, the same
pipeline cannot be applied even if the EEG data is collected for the same
experiment but with different acquisition devices. This necessitates the
development of a framework for learning EEG embeddings, which could be highly
beneficial for tasks involving multiple EEG samples for the same task but with
varying numbers of EEG channels. In this work, we propose EEG Adapter (EAD), a
flexible framework compatible with any signal acquisition device. More
specifically, we leverage a recent EEG foundational model with significant
adaptations to learn robust representations from the EEG data for the
classification task. We evaluate EAD on two publicly available datasets
achieving state-of-the-art accuracies 99.33% and 92.31% on EEG-ImageNet and
BrainLat respectively. This illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed
framework across diverse EEG datasets containing two different perception
tasks: stimulus and resting-state EEG signals. We also perform zero-shot EEG
classification on EEG-ImageNet task to demonstrate the generalization
capability of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Early detection of dementia is crucial to devise effective interventions.
Comprehensive cognitive tests, while being the most accurate means of
diagnosis, are long and tedious, thus limiting their applicability to a large
population, especially when periodic assessments are needed. The problem is
compounded by the fact that people have differing patterns of cognitive
impairment as they progress to different forms of dementia. This paper presents
a novel scheme by which individual-specific patterns of impairment can be
identified and used to devise personalized tests for periodic follow-up.
Patterns of cognitive impairment are initially learned from a population
cluster of combined normals and MCIs, using a set of standardized cognitive
tests. Impairment patterns in the population are identified using a 2-step
procedure involving an ensemble wrapper feature selection followed by cluster
identification and analysis. These patterns have been shown to correspond to
clinically accepted variants of MCI, a prodrome of dementia. The learned
clusters of patterns can subsequently be used to identify the most likely route
of cognitive impairment, even for pre-symptomatic and apparently normal people.
Baseline data of 24,000 subjects from the NACC database was used for the study.

Abstract: Accurately predicting 3D occupancy grids from visual inputs is critical for
autonomous driving, but current discriminative methods struggle with noisy
data, incomplete observations, and the complex structures inherent in 3D
scenes. In this work, we reframe 3D occupancy prediction as a generative
modeling task using diffusion models, which learn the underlying data
distribution and incorporate 3D scene priors. This approach enhances prediction
consistency, noise robustness, and better handles the intricacies of 3D spatial
structures. Our extensive experiments show that diffusion-based generative
models outperform state-of-the-art discriminative approaches, delivering more
realistic and accurate occupancy predictions, especially in occluded or
low-visibility regions. Moreover, the improved predictions significantly
benefit downstream planning tasks, highlighting the practical advantages of our
method for real-world autonomous driving applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在场景文本图像超分辨率中存在文本区域定位不准确和字符形状建模效果差的问题，导致生成图像质量下降。

Method: TextSR利用文本检测器和OCR提取多语言文本，通过UTF-8编码器和交叉注意力将字符转换为视觉形状，并结合两种创新方法增强模型鲁棒性。

Result: 模型在TextZoom和TextVQA数据集上表现优异，为STISR设立了新基准。

Conclusion: TextSR通过整合文本字符先验和低分辨率图像，显著提升了文本超分辨率的细节和可读性。

Abstract: While recent advancements in Image Super-Resolution (SR) using diffusion
models have shown promise in improving overall image quality, their application
to scene text images has revealed limitations. These models often struggle with
accurate text region localization and fail to effectively model image and
multilingual character-to-shape priors. This leads to inconsistencies, the
generation of hallucinated textures, and a decrease in the perceived quality of
the super-resolved text.
  To address these issues, we introduce TextSR, a multimodal diffusion model
specifically designed for Multilingual Scene Text Image Super-Resolution.
TextSR leverages a text detector to pinpoint text regions within an image and
then employs Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract multilingual text
from these areas. The extracted text characters are then transformed into
visual shapes using a UTF-8 based text encoder and cross-attention. Recognizing
that OCR may sometimes produce inaccurate results in real-world scenarios, we
have developed two innovative methods to enhance the robustness of our model.
By integrating text character priors with the low-resolution text images, our
model effectively guides the super-resolution process, enhancing fine details
within the text and improving overall legibility. The superior performance of
our model on both the TextZoom and TextVQA datasets sets a new benchmark for
STISR, underscoring the efficacy of our approach.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于运动掩码的两阶段网络（MMGT），通过音频、运动掩码和运动特征联合驱动，生成高质量的同步语音手势视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅依赖音频控制信号难以捕捉大幅手势动作，导致视频中出现明显失真和伪影，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出MMGT网络，第一阶段通过SMGA网络从音频生成高质量姿势视频和运动掩码；第二阶段结合MM-HAA模块，改进细粒度运动生成和区域细节控制。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在视频质量、唇同步和手势生成方面均有提升。

Conclusion: MMGT通过两阶段设计，有效解决了传统方法在细节控制和运动生成上的不足，实现了高质量的语音手势视频生成。

Abstract: Co-Speech Gesture Video Generation aims to generate vivid speech videos from
audio-driven still images, which is challenging due to the diversity of
different parts of the body in terms of amplitude of motion, audio relevance,
and detailed features. Relying solely on audio as the control signal often
fails to capture large gesture movements in video, leading to more pronounced
artifacts and distortions. Existing approaches typically address this issue by
introducing additional a priori information, but this can limit the practical
application of the task. Specifically, we propose a Motion Mask-Guided
Two-Stage Network (MMGT) that uses audio, as well as motion masks and motion
features generated from the audio signal to jointly drive the generation of
synchronized speech gesture videos. In the first stage, the Spatial Mask-Guided
Audio Pose Generation (SMGA) Network generates high-quality pose videos and
motion masks from audio, effectively capturing large movements in key regions
such as the face and gestures. In the second stage, we integrate the Motion
Masked Hierarchical Audio Attention (MM-HAA) into the Stabilized Diffusion
Video Generation model, overcoming limitations in fine-grained motion
generation and region-specific detail control found in traditional methods.
This guarantees high-quality, detailed upper-body video generation with
accurate texture and motion details. Evaluations show improved video quality,
lip-sync, and gesture. The model and code are available at

Result: 在CVPR 2025测试集上达到44.5%的驾驶分数。

Conclusion: HMAD展示了将轨迹生成与安全评分分离的优势，为高级自动驾驶提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving faces persistent challenges in both generating
diverse, rule-compliant trajectories and robustly selecting the optimal path
from these options via learned, multi-faceted evaluation. To address these
challenges, we introduce HMAD, a framework integrating a distinctive
Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) based trajectory proposal mechanism with learned
multi-criteria scoring. HMAD leverages BEVFormer and employs learnable anchored
queries, initialized from a trajectory dictionary and refined via iterative
offset decoding (inspired by DiffusionDrive), to produce numerous diverse and
stable candidate trajectories. A key innovation, our simulation-supervised
scorer module, then evaluates these proposals against critical metrics
including no at-fault collisions, drivable area compliance, comfortableness,
and overall driving quality (i.e., extended PDM score). Demonstrating its
efficacy, HMAD achieves a 44.5% driving score on the CVPR 2025 private test
set. This work highlights the benefits of effectively decoupling robust
trajectory generation from comprehensive, safety-aware learned scoring for
advanced autonomous driving.

Motivation: 专业艺术家通过照片修图增强情感表达和叙事深度，而现有自动化工具缺乏解释性和互动性。

Method: 结合视觉语言模型和自然语言推理，分析艺术需求，制定修图策略，并通过API输出参数到Lightroom，迭代优化结果。

Result: PhotoArtAgent在用户研究中优于现有自动化工具，结果接近专业艺术家水平。

Conclusion: PhotoArtAgent通过透明解释和用户控制，实现了高质量且交互性强的照片修图。

Abstract: Photo retouching is integral to photographic art, extending far beyond simple
technical fixes to heighten emotional expression and narrative depth. While
artists leverage expertise to create unique visual effects through deliberate
adjustments, non-professional users often rely on automated tools that produce
visually pleasing results but lack interpretative depth and interactive
transparency. In this paper, we introduce PhotoArtAgent, an intelligent system
that combines Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with advanced natural language
reasoning to emulate the creative process of a professional artist. The agent
performs explicit artistic analysis, plans retouching strategies, and outputs
precise parameters to Lightroom through an API. It then evaluates the resulting
images and iteratively refines them until the desired artistic vision is
achieved. Throughout this process, PhotoArtAgent provides transparent,
text-based explanations of its creative rationale, fostering meaningful
interaction and user control. Experimental results show that PhotoArtAgent not
only surpasses existing automated tools in user studies but also achieves
results comparable to those of professional human artists.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Zero-to-Hero的参考视频编辑方法，通过分解编辑过程为两个阶段，解决了现有文本引导方法的模糊性和控制不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本引导的视频编辑方法存在用户意图模糊和细粒度控制不足的问题，需要一种更精确和一致的方法。

Method: 方法分为两个阶段：Zero阶段通过编辑锚帧作为参考图像，并利用原始帧的对应关系引导注意力机制；Hero阶段学习条件生成模型以修复视频。

Result: 方法在PSNR上比最佳基线提高了2.6 dB，并通过Blender构建的数据集验证了外观一致性。

Conclusion: Zero-to-Hero方法在视频编辑中实现了更高的准确性和时间一致性，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Appearance editing according to user needs is a pivotal task in video
editing. Existing text-guided methods often lead to ambiguities regarding user
intentions and restrict fine-grained control over editing specific aspects of
objects. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a novel approach
named {Zero-to-Hero}, which focuses on reference-based video editing that
disentangles the editing process into two distinct problems. It achieves this
by first editing an anchor frame to satisfy user requirements as a reference
image and then consistently propagating its appearance across other frames. We
leverage correspondence within the original frames to guide the attention
mechanism, which is more robust than previously proposed optical flow or
temporal modules in memory-friendly video generative models, especially when
dealing with objects exhibiting large motions. It offers a solid ZERO-shot
initialization that ensures both accuracy and temporal consistency. However,
intervention in the attention mechanism results in compounded imaging
degradation with over-saturated colors and unknown blurring issues. Starting
from Zero-Stage, our Hero-Stage Holistically learns a conditional generative
model for vidEo RestOration. To accurately evaluate the consistency of the
appearance, we construct a set of videos with multiple appearances using
Blender, enabling a fine-grained and deterministic evaluation. Our method
outperforms the best-performing baseline with a PSNR improvement of 2.6 dB. The

Motivation: 现有医学AI模型在胸片解读中采用简单的输入-输出范式，忽略了诊断推理的序列性和上下文依赖性，导致与临床场景不匹配。

Method: 构建CXRTrek数据集，包含8个诊断阶段的42.8万样本和1100万问答对；提出CXRTrekNet模型，将临床推理流程融入视觉语言大模型框架。

Conclusion: CXRTrek数据集和模型填补了医学AI在胸片解读中缺乏上下文推理的空白，为临床实践提供了更贴合的工具。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)-based chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation
assistants have demonstrated significant progress and are increasingly being
applied in clinical settings. However, contemporary medical AI models often
adhere to a simplistic input-to-output paradigm, directly processing an image
and an instruction to generate a result, where the instructions may be integral
to the model's architecture. This approach overlooks the modeling of the
inherent diagnostic reasoning in chest X-ray interpretation. Such reasoning is
typically sequential, where each interpretive stage considers the images, the
current task, and the contextual information from previous stages. This
oversight leads to several shortcomings, including misalignment with clinical
scenarios, contextless reasoning, and untraceable errors. To fill this gap, we
construct CXRTrek, a new multi-stage visual question answering (VQA) dataset
for CXR interpretation. The dataset is designed to explicitly simulate the
diagnostic reasoning process employed by radiologists in real-world clinical
settings for the first time. CXRTrek covers 8 sequential diagnostic stages,
comprising 428,966 samples and over 11 million question-answer (Q&A) pairs,
with an average of 26.29 Q&A pairs per sample. Building on the CXRTrek dataset,
we propose a new vision-language large model (VLLM), CXRTrekNet, specifically
designed to incorporate the clinical reasoning flow into the VLLM framework.
CXRTrekNet effectively models the dependencies between diagnostic stages and
captures reasoning patterns within the radiological context. Trained on our
dataset, the model consistently outperforms existing medical VLLMs on the
CXRTrek benchmarks and demonstrates superior generalization across multiple
tasks on five diverse external datasets. The dataset and model can be found in
our repository (https://github.com/guanjinquan/CXRTrek).

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于流的图像编辑方法（如FlowEdit）因缺乏精确潜在反演而导致的编辑轨迹不稳定和源一致性差的问题。

Method: 引入流匹配损失作为正则化机制，平衡编辑提示的语义对齐和源图像的结构一致性，支持反向编辑。

Result: 实验表明，FlowAlign在源图像保留和编辑可控性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FlowAlign通过流匹配损失实现了更稳定和一致的图像编辑，支持反向操作，提升了编辑效果。

Abstract: Recent inversion-free, flow-based image editing methods such as FlowEdit
leverages a pre-trained noise-to-image flow model such as Stable Diffusion 3,
enabling text-driven manipulation by solving an ordinary differential equation
(ODE). While the lack of exact latent inversion is a core advantage of these
methods, it often results in unstable editing trajectories and poor source
consistency. To address this limitation, we propose FlowAlign, a novel
inversion-free flow-based framework for consistent image editing with
principled trajectory control. FlowAlign introduces a flow-matching loss as a
regularization mechanism to promote smoother and more stable trajectories
during the editing process. Notably, the flow-matching loss is shown to
explicitly balance semantic alignment with the edit prompt and structural
consistency with the source image along the trajectory. Furthermore, FlowAlign
naturally supports reverse editing by simply reversing the ODE trajectory,
highlighting the reversible and consistent nature of the transformation.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlowAlign outperforms existing methods
in both source preservation and editing controllability.

Result: 在UnAV-100和LLP数据集上，PreFM显著优于现有方法，且参数更少。

Conclusion: PreFM为实时多模态视频理解提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Audio-visual event parsing plays a crucial role in understanding multimodal
video content, but existing methods typically rely on offline processing of
entire videos with huge model sizes, limiting their real-time applicability. We
introduce Online Audio-Visual Event Parsing (On-AVEP), a novel paradigm for
parsing audio, visual, and audio-visual events by sequentially analyzing
incoming video streams. The On-AVEP task necessitates models with two key
capabilities: (1) Accurate online inference, to effectively distinguish events
with unclear and limited context in online settings, and (2) Real-time
efficiency, to balance high performance with computational constraints. To
cultivate these, we propose the Predictive Future Modeling (PreFM) framework
featured by (a) predictive multimodal future modeling to infer and integrate
beneficial future audio-visual cues, thereby enhancing contextual understanding
and (b) modality-agnostic robust representation along with focal temporal
prioritization to improve precision and generalization. Extensive experiments
on the UnAV-100 and LLP datasets show PreFM significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods by a large margin with significantly fewer parameters,
offering an insightful approach for real-time multimodal video understanding.

Abstract: In this work, we present a novel level-of-detail (LOD) method for 3D Gaussian
Splatting that enables real-time rendering of large-scale scenes on
memory-constrained devices. Our approach introduces a hierarchical LOD
representation that iteratively selects optimal subsets of Gaussians based on
camera distance, thus largely reducing both rendering time and GPU memory
usage. We construct each LOD level by applying a depth-aware 3D smoothing
filter, followed by importance-based pruning and fine-tuning to maintain visual
fidelity. To further reduce memory overhead, we partition the scene into
spatial chunks and dynamically load only relevant Gaussians during rendering,
employing an opacity-blending mechanism to avoid visual artifacts at chunk
boundaries. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both outdoor
(Hierarchical 3DGS) and indoor (Zip-NeRF) datasets, delivering high-quality
renderings with reduced latency and memory requirements.

Method: 使用频率感知隐式神经表示、对抗鲁棒初始化、正交Procrustes投影和混合损失。

Result: 实现了文本到图像生成、风格迁移和图像重建等功能。

Conclusion: 判别模型可能隐藏未开发的生成潜力。

Abstract: CLIP is a discriminative model trained to align images and text in a shared
embedding space. Due to its multimodal structure, it serves as the backbone of
many generative pipelines, where a decoder is trained to map from the shared
space back to images. In this work, we show that image synthesis is
nevertheless possible using CLIP alone -- without any decoder, training, or
fine-tuning. Our approach optimizes a frequency-aware implicit neural
representation that encourages coarse-to-fine generation by stratifying
frequencies across network layers. To stabilize this inverse mapping, we
introduce adversarially robust initialization, a lightweight Orthogonal
Procrustes projection to align local text and image embeddings, and a blending
loss that anchors outputs to natural image statistics. Without altering CLIP's
weights, this framework unlocks capabilities such as text-to-image generation,
style transfer, and image reconstruction. These findings suggest that
discriminative models may hold untapped generative potential, hidden in plain
sight.

Abstract: Imitation Learning has become a fundamental approach in robotic manipulation.
However, collecting large-scale real-world robot demonstrations is
prohibitively expensive. Simulators offer a cost-effective alternative, but the
sim-to-real gap make it extremely challenging to scale. Therefore, we introduce
RoboTransfer, a diffusion-based video generation framework for robotic data
synthesis. Unlike previous methods, RoboTransfer integrates multi-view geometry
with explicit control over scene components, such as background and object
attributes. By incorporating cross-view feature interactions and global
depth/normal conditions, RoboTransfer ensures geometry consistency across
views. This framework allows fine-grained control, including background edits
and object swaps. Experiments demonstrate that RoboTransfer is capable of
generating multi-view videos with enhanced geometric consistency and visual
fidelity. In addition, policies trained on the data generated by RoboTransfer
achieve a 33.3% relative improvement in the success rate in the DIFF-OBJ
setting and a substantial 251% relative improvement in the more challenging
DIFF-ALL scenario. Explore more demos on our project page:

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant visual
understanding capabilities, yet their fine-grained visual perception in complex
real-world scenarios, such as densely crowded public areas, remains limited.
Inspired by the recent success of reinforcement learning (RL) in both LLMs and
MLLMs, in this paper, we explore how RL can enhance visual perception ability
of MLLMs. Then we develop a novel RL-based framework, Deep Inspection and
Perception with RL (DIP-R1) designed to enhance the visual perception
capabilities of MLLMs, by comprehending complex scenes and looking through
visual instances closely. DIP-R1 guides MLLMs through detailed inspection of
visual scene via three simply designed rule-based reward modelings. First, we
adopt a standard reasoning reward encouraging the model to include three
step-by-step processes: 1) reasoning for understanding visual scenes, 2)
observing for looking through interested but ambiguous regions, and 3)
decision-making for predicting answer. Second, a variance-guided looking reward
is designed to examine uncertain regions for the second observing process. It
explicitly enables the model to inspect ambiguous areas, improving its ability
to mitigate perceptual uncertainties. Third, we model a weighted
precision-recall accuracy reward enhancing accurate decision-making. We explore
its effectiveness across diverse fine-grained object detection data consisting
of challenging real-world environments, such as densely crowded scenes. Built
upon existing MLLMs, DIP-R1 achieves consistent and significant improvement
across various in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios. It also outperforms
various existing baseline models and supervised fine-tuning methods. Our
findings highlight the substantial potential of integrating RL into MLLMs for
enhancing capabilities in complex real-world perception tasks.

Conclusion: HiGarment成功解决了FS2RG任务中的挑战，为服装合成提供了新方法。

Abstract: Diffusion-based garment synthesis tasks primarily focus on the design phase
in the fashion domain, while the garment production process remains largely
underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new task: Flat Sketch to
Realistic Garment Image (FS2RG), which generates realistic garment images by
integrating flat sketches and textual guidance. FS2RG presents two key
challenges: 1) fabric characteristics are solely guided by textual prompts,
providing insufficient visual supervision for diffusion-based models, which
limits their ability to capture fine-grained fabric details; 2) flat sketches
and textual guidance may provide conflicting information, requiring the model
to selectively preserve or modify garment attributes while maintaining
structural coherence. To tackle this task, we propose HiGarment, a novel
framework that comprises two core components: i) a multi-modal semantic
enhancement mechanism that enhances fabric representation across textual and
visual modalities, and ii) a harmonized cross-attention mechanism that
dynamically balances information from flat sketches and text prompts, allowing
controllable synthesis by generating either sketch-aligned (image-biased) or
text-guided (text-biased) outputs. Furthermore, we collect Multi-modal Detailed

Motivation: 随着文本到图像模型的兴起，身份滥用和AIGC检测器的鲁棒性问题引发关注。

Method: 利用语法树结构和蒙特卡洛树搜索变体，系统探索语义提示空间，生成多样且可控的对抗性提示。

Result: 方法在多个T2I模型中验证有效，并在实际对抗性AIGC检测竞赛中排名第一。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅可用于攻击场景，还能构建高质量对抗数据集，为训练和评估更鲁棒的AIGC检测与防御系统提供资源。

Abstract: The rise of text-to-image (T2I) models has enabled the synthesis of
photorealistic human portraits, raising serious concerns about identity misuse
and the robustness of AIGC detectors. In this work, we propose an automated
adversarial prompt generation framework that leverages a grammar tree structure
and a variant of the Monte Carlo tree search algorithm to systematically
explore the semantic prompt space. Our method generates diverse, controllable
prompts that consistently evade both open-source and commercial AIGC detectors.
Extensive experiments across multiple T2I models validate its effectiveness,
and the approach ranked first in a real-world adversarial AIGC detection
competition. Beyond attack scenarios, our method can also be used to construct
high-quality adversarial datasets, providing valuable resources for training
and evaluating more robust AIGC detection and defense systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 航空图像中的物体检测面临多样化的场景和物体外观变化，导致定位和识别困难。

Method: 设计了视觉语义推理器和关系学习损失，分别处理场景级和实例级的变化。

Result: 实验证明该方法显著提升了检测性能。

Conclusion: LANGO框架通过语言引导学习有效缓解了航空图像中的物体检测问题。

Abstract: Despite recent advancements in computer vision research, object detection in
aerial images still suffers from several challenges. One primary challenge to
be mitigated is the presence of multiple types of variation in aerial images,
for example, illumination and viewpoint changes. These variations result in
highly diverse image scenes and drastic alterations in object appearance, so
that it becomes more complicated to localize objects from the whole image scene
and recognize their categories. To address this problem, in this paper, we
introduce a novel object detection framework in aerial images, named
LANGuage-guided Object detection (LANGO). Upon the proposed language-guided
learning, the proposed framework is designed to alleviate the impacts from both
scene and instance-level variations. First, we are motivated by the way humans
understand the semantics of scenes while perceiving environmental factors in
the scenes (e.g., weather). Therefore, we design a visual semantic reasoner
that comprehends visual semantics of image scenes by interpreting conditions
where the given images were captured. Second, we devise a training objective,
named relation learning loss, to deal with instance-level variations, such as
viewpoint angle and scale changes. This training objective aims to learn
relations in language representations of object categories, with the help of
the robust characteristics against such variations. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and our
method obtains noticeable detection performance improvements.

TL;DR: WTEFNet是一个专为低光场景设计的实时目标检测框架，通过低光增强、小波特征提取和自适应融合检测模块，显著提升了低光条件下的检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有RGB相机在低光条件下性能下降的问题，提升ADAS系统的环境感知能力。

Method: WTEFNet包含三个核心模块：低光增强（LLE）、小波特征提取（WFE）和自适应融合检测（AFFD），结合GSN数据集进行训练和评估。

Result: 在BDD100K、SHIFT、nuScenes和GSN数据集上达到最先进的低光检测精度，并在嵌入式平台上实现实时性能。

Conclusion: WTEFNet在低光条件下表现出色，适用于实时ADAS应用。

Abstract: Object detection is a cornerstone of environmental perception in advanced
driver assistance systems(ADAS). However, most existing methods rely on RGB
cameras, which suffer from significant performance degradation under low-light
conditions due to poor image quality. To address this challenge, we proposes
WTEFNet, a real-time object detection framework specifically designed for
low-light scenarios, with strong adaptability to mainstream detectors. WTEFNet
comprises three core modules: a Low-Light Enhancement (LLE) module, a
Wavelet-based Feature Extraction (WFE) module, and an Adaptive Fusion Detection
(AFFD) module. The LLE enhances dark regions while suppressing overexposed
areas; the WFE applies multi-level discrete wavelet transforms to isolate high-
and low-frequency components, enabling effective denoising and structural
feature retention; the AFFD fuses semantic and illumination features for robust
detection. To support training and evaluation, we introduce GSN, a manually
annotated dataset covering both clear and rainy night-time scenes. Extensive
experiments on BDD100K, SHIFT, nuScenes, and GSN demonstrate that WTEFNet
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy under low-light conditions. Furthermore,
deployment on a embedded platform (NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin) confirms the
framework's suitability for real-time ADAS applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于3D点云的多模态融合方法，使用双分支Transformer模型学习几何和光谱特征，并通过跨注意力机制实现多尺度特征融合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多基于2D数据，即使有3D数据也常被降维处理，未能充分利用3D数据的潜力。

Method: 在3D点云中融合多模态数据，采用双分支Transformer模型和跨注意力机制。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，3D融合方法表现优于2D方法，并能生成3D预测。

Conclusion: 3D融合方法在分类任务中具有竞争力，且提供了更高的灵活性。

Abstract: Multimodal remote sensing data, including spectral and lidar or
photogrammetry, is crucial for achieving satisfactory land-use / land-cover
classification results in urban scenes. So far, most studies have been
conducted in a 2D context. When 3D information is available in the dataset, it
is typically integrated with the 2D data by rasterizing the 3D data into 2D
formats. Although this method yields satisfactory classification results, it
falls short in fully exploiting the potential of 3D data by restricting the
model's ability to learn 3D spatial features directly from raw point clouds.
Additionally, it limits the generation of 3D predictions, as the dimensionality
of the input data has been reduced. In this study, we propose a fully 3D-based
method that fuses all modalities within the 3D point cloud and employs a
dedicated dual-branch Transformer model to simultaneously learn geometric and
spectral features. To enhance the fusion process, we introduce a
cross-attention-based mechanism that fully operates on 3D points, effectively
integrating features from various modalities across multiple scales. The
purpose of cross-attention is to allow one modality to assess the importance of
another by weighing the relevant features. We evaluated our method by comparing
it against both 3D and 2D methods using the 2018 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest
(DFC2018) dataset. Our findings indicate that 3D fusion delivers competitive
results compared to 2D methods and offers more flexibility by providing 3D
predictions. These predictions can be projected onto 2D maps, a capability that
is not feasible in reverse. Additionally, we evaluated our method on different
datasets, specifically the ISPRS Vaihingen 3D and the IEEE 2019 Data Fusion
Contest. Our code will be published here:

TL;DR: FlexMerge是一种无需数据的新型模型合并框架，可灵活生成不同大小的合并模型，平衡准确性和成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单模型合并的准确性差距问题，同时避免部署多个独立模型的高成本。

Method: 将微调模型视为顺序块集合，逐步合并，支持多种合并算法，并允许按需停止。

Result: 在视觉和NLP基准测试中，适度增大的合并模型比单一模型显著提高准确性。

Conclusion: FlexMerge为多样化部署场景提供了灵活、高效且无需数据的解决方案。

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as an efficient method to combine multiple
single-task fine-tuned models. The merged model can enjoy multi-task
capabilities without expensive training. While promising, merging into a single
model often suffers from an accuracy gap with respect to individual fine-tuned
models. On the other hand, deploying all individual fine-tuned models incurs
high costs. We propose FlexMerge, a novel data-free model merging framework to
flexibly generate merged models of varying sizes, spanning the spectrum from a
single merged model to retaining all individual fine-tuned models. FlexMerge
treats fine-tuned models as collections of sequential blocks and progressively
merges them using any existing data-free merging method, halting at a desired
size. We systematically explore the accuracy-size trade-off exhibited by
different merging algorithms in combination with FlexMerge. Extensive
experiments on vision and NLP benchmarks, with up to 30 tasks, reveal that even
modestly larger merged models can provide substantial accuracy improvements
over a single model. By offering fine-grained control over fused model size,
FlexMerge provides a flexible, data-free, and high-performance solution for
diverse deployment scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红外小目标检测（ISTD）在军事、海事和预警应用中至关重要，但现有深度学习方法存在信息丢失和全局上下文建模效率低的问题。

Method: 提出SAMamba框架，包括FS-Adapter用于域适应、CSI模块用于高效全局上下文建模、DPCF模块用于多尺度特征融合。

Result: 在多个数据集上显著优于现有方法，特别是在复杂背景和多尺度目标场景中。

Conclusion: SAMamba通过域适应、细节保留和长距离依赖建模，有效解决了ISTD的核心挑战。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) is vital for long-range surveillance
in military, maritime, and early warning applications. ISTD is challenged by
targets occupying less than 0.15% of the image and low distinguishability from
complex backgrounds. Existing deep learning methods often suffer from
information loss during downsampling and inefficient global context modeling.
This paper presents SAMamba, a novel framework integrating SAM2's hierarchical
feature learning with Mamba's selective sequence modeling. Key innovations
include: (1) A Feature Selection Adapter (FS-Adapter) for efficient
natural-to-infrared domain adaptation via dual-stage selection (token-level
with a learnable task embedding and channel-wise adaptive transformations); (2)
A Cross-Channel State-Space Interaction (CSI) module for efficient global
context modeling with linear complexity using selective state space modeling;
and (3) A Detail-Preserving Contextual Fusion (DPCF) module that adaptively
combines multi-scale features with a gating mechanism to balance
high-resolution and low-resolution feature contributions. SAMamba addresses
core ISTD challenges by bridging the domain gap, maintaining fine-grained
details, and efficiently modeling long-range dependencies. Experiments on
NUAA-SIRST, IRSTD-1k, and NUDT-SIRST datasets show SAMamba significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in challenging scenarios with
heterogeneous backgrounds and varying target scales. Code:

Motivation: 现有方法依赖UV映射和图像重投影，导致拓扑模糊问题，UniTEX旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 1. 使用Texture Functions（TFs）将纹理生成提升到3D空间；2. 基于Transformer的大规模纹理模型（LTM）直接从图像和几何输入预测TFs；3. 采用LoRA策略优化Diffusion Transformers（DiTs）进行多视角纹理合成。

Result: 实验表明，UniTEX在视觉质量和纹理完整性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: UniTEX为自动化3D纹理生成提供了通用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: We present UniTEX, a novel two-stage 3D texture generation framework to
create high-quality, consistent textures for 3D assets. Existing approaches
predominantly rely on UV-based inpainting to refine textures after reprojecting
the generated multi-view images onto the 3D shapes, which introduces challenges
related to topological ambiguity. To address this, we propose to bypass the
limitations of UV mapping by operating directly in a unified 3D functional
space. Specifically, we first propose that lifts texture generation into 3D
space via Texture Functions (TFs)--a continuous, volumetric representation that
maps any 3D point to a texture value based solely on surface proximity,
independent of mesh topology. Then, we propose to predict these TFs directly
from images and geometry inputs using a transformer-based Large Texturing Model
(LTM). To further enhance texture quality and leverage powerful 2D priors, we
develop an advanced LoRA-based strategy for efficiently adapting large-scale
Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) for high-quality multi-view texture synthesis as
our first stage. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniTEX achieves
superior visual quality and texture integrity compared to existing approaches,
offering a generalizable and scalable solution for automated 3D texture
generation. Code will available in: https://github.com/YixunLiang/UniTEX.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs在图像美学推理任务中表现不佳，尤其是在医学图像筛选领域，缺乏数据和模型能力不足是主要问题。

Method: 收集了包含1500+样本的医学图像筛选数据集，并提出了基于长链思维（CoT）和动态比例精度奖励（DPA-GRPO）的强化学习方法。

Result: 实验表明，即使最先进的闭源MLLMs（如GPT-4o）在图像美学推理中表现接近随机猜测，而本文方法通过小模型超越了这些大模型的性能。

Conclusion: 本文的研究为图像美学推理提供了一种可行的解决方案，并有望成为未来相关任务的常规配置。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are of great application across many
domains, such as multimodal understanding and generation. With the development
of diffusion models (DM) and unified MLLMs, the performance of image generation
has been significantly improved, however, the study of image screening is rare
and its performance with MLLMs is unsatisfactory due to the lack of data and
the week image aesthetic reasoning ability in MLLMs. In this work, we propose a
complete solution to address these problems in terms of data and methodology.
For data, we collect a comprehensive medical image screening dataset with 1500+
samples, each sample consists of a medical image, four generated images, and a
multiple-choice answer. The dataset evaluates the aesthetic reasoning ability
under four aspects: \textit{(1) Appearance Deformation, (2) Principles of
Physical Lighting and Shadow, (3) Placement Layout, (4) Extension Rationality}.
For methodology, we utilize long chains of thought (CoT) and Group Relative
Policy Optimization with Dynamic Proportional Accuracy reward, called DPA-GRPO,
to enhance the image aesthetic reasoning ability of MLLMs. Our experimental
results reveal that even state-of-the-art closed-source MLLMs, such as GPT-4o
and Qwen-VL-Max, exhibit performance akin to random guessing in image aesthetic
reasoning. In contrast, by leveraging the reinforcement learning approach, we
are able to surpass the score of both large-scale models and leading
closed-source models using a much smaller model. We hope our attempt on medical
image screening will serve as a regular configuration in image aesthetic
reasoning in the future.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频消费是日常生活的重要组成部分，但观看完整视频可能很繁琐。现有方法未将视频帧和转录文本结合在强化学习框架中。

Method: 提出多模态管道，结合视频帧和转录文本，利用强化学习训练模型生成多样且具代表性的摘要，并确保包含有意义的转录内容。

Result: 实验表明，结合转录文本的视频摘要和亮点检测优于仅依赖视觉内容的方法。

Conclusion: 多模态方法在视频摘要和亮点检测中表现优越，且无监督训练可克服标注数据不足的问题。

Abstract: Video consumption is a key part of daily life, but watching entire videos can
be tedious. To address this, researchers have explored video summarization and
highlight detection to identify key video segments. While some works combine
video frames and transcripts, and others tackle video summarization and
highlight detection using Reinforcement Learning (RL), no existing work, to the
best of our knowledge, integrates both modalities within an RL framework. In
this paper, we propose a multimodal pipeline that leverages video frames and
their corresponding transcripts to generate a more condensed version of the
video and detect highlights using a modality fusion mechanism. The pipeline is
trained within an RL framework, which rewards the model for generating diverse
and representative summaries while ensuring the inclusion of video segments
with meaningful transcript content. The unsupervised nature of the training
allows for learning from large-scale unannotated datasets, overcoming the
challenge posed by the limited size of existing annotated datasets. Our
experiments show that using the transcript in video summarization and highlight
detection achieves superior results compared to relying solely on the visual
content of the video.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CLIP方法在推理时需选择参数，易出错且性能下降，需改进。

Result: LADA在持续学习任务中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: LADA通过轻量级设计有效解决了CLIP持续学习中的问题，性能优越。

Abstract: Continual learning with vision-language models like CLIP offers a pathway
toward scalable machine learning systems by leveraging its transferable
representations. Existing CLIP-based methods adapt the pre-trained image
encoder by adding multiple sets of learnable parameters, with each task using a
partial set of parameters. This requires selecting the expected parameters for
input images during inference, which is prone to error that degrades
performance. To address this problem, we introduce LADA (Label-specific
ADApter). Instead of partitioning parameters across tasks, LADA appends
lightweight, label-specific memory units to the frozen CLIP image encoder,
enabling discriminative feature generation by aggregating task-agnostic
knowledge. To prevent catastrophic forgetting, LADA employs feature
distillation for seen classes, preventing their features from being interfered
with by new classes. Positioned after the image encoder, LADA prevents gradient
flow to the frozen CLIP parameters, ensuring efficient training. Extensive
results show that LADA achieves state-of-the-art performance in continual
learning settings. The implementation code is available at
https://github.com/MaolinLuo/LADA.

Method: 提出两层次评估框架（感知与认知），构建包含924张静态图像和100个动态视频的多模态讽刺数据集，评估8种SoTA MLMs。

Result: MLMs在感知任务表现良好，但在讽刺理解上平均错误率达16.1%，主要因情感推理、常识推断和上下文对齐不足。

Conclusion: 实证支持‘视觉房间’论证，为MLMs提供新评估范式，强调感知与理解的差距。

Abstract: Can multi-modal large models (MLMs) that can ``see'' an image be said to
``understand'' it? Drawing inspiration from Searle's Chinese Room, we propose
the \textbf{Visual Room} argument: a system may process and describe every
detail of visual inputs by following algorithmic rules, without genuinely
comprehending the underlying intention. This dilemma challenges the prevailing
assumption that perceptual mastery implies genuine understanding. In
implementation, we introduce a two-tier evaluation framework spanning
perception and cognition. The perception component evaluates whether MLMs can
accurately capture the surface-level details of visual contents, where the
cognitive component examines their ability to infer sarcasm polarity. To
support this framework, We further introduce a high-quality multi-modal sarcasm
dataset comprising both 924 static images and 100 dynamic videos. All sarcasm
labels are annotated by the original authors and verified by independent
reviewers to ensure clarity and consistency. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art
(SoTA) MLMs. Our results highlight three key findings: (1) MLMs perform well on
perception tasks; (2) even with correct perception, models exhibit an average
error rate of ~16.1\% in sarcasm understanding, revealing a significant gap
between seeing and understanding; (3) error analysis attributes this gap to
deficiencies in emotional reasoning, commonsense inference, and context
alignment. This work provides empirical grounding for the proposed Visual Room
argument and offers a new evaluation paradigm for MLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting have shown remarkable potential for
novel view synthesis. However, most existing large-scale scene reconstruction
methods rely on the divide-and-conquer paradigm, which often leads to the loss
of global scene information and requires complex parameter tuning due to scene
partitioning and local optimization. To address these limitations, we propose
MixGS, a novel holistic optimization framework for large-scale 3D scene
reconstruction. MixGS models the entire scene holistically by integrating
camera pose and Gaussian attributes into a view-aware representation, which is
decoded into fine-detailed Gaussians. Furthermore, a novel mixing operation
combines decoded and original Gaussians to jointly preserve global coherence
and local fidelity. Extensive experiments on large-scale scenes demonstrate
that MixGS achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality and competitive speed,
while significantly reducing computational requirements, enabling large-scale
scene reconstruction training on a single 24GB VRAM GPU. The code will be
released at https://github.com/azhuantou/MixGS.

Abstract: Detecting forged remote sensing images is becoming increasingly critical, as
such imagery plays a vital role in environmental monitoring, urban planning,
and national security. While diffusion models have emerged as the dominant
paradigm for image generation, their impact on remote sensing forgery detection
remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks primarily target GAN-based forgeries
or focus on natural images, limiting progress in this critical domain. To
address this gap, we introduce RSFAKE-1M, a large-scale dataset of 500K forged
and 500K real remote sensing images. The fake images are generated by ten
diffusion models fine-tuned on remote sensing data, covering six generation
conditions such as text prompts, structural guidance, and inpainting. This
paper presents the construction of RSFAKE-1M along with a comprehensive
experimental evaluation using both existing detectors and unified baselines.
The results reveal that diffusion-based remote sensing forgeries remain
challenging for current methods, and that models trained on RSFAKE-1M exhibit
notably improved generalization and robustness. Our findings underscore the
importance of RSFAKE-1M as a foundation for developing and evaluating
next-generation forgery detection approaches in the remote sensing domain. The

Conclusion: 该方法提升了生成CAD模型的可行性，有助于扩展高质量训练数据的可用性，并增强AI驱动CAD生成在制造业、建筑和产品设计中的适用性。

Abstract: With the advancement of generative AI, research on its application to 3D
model generation has gained traction, particularly in automating the creation
of Computer-Aided Design (CAD) files from images. GenCAD is a notable model in
this domain, leveraging an autoregressive transformer-based architecture with a
contrastive learning framework to generate CAD programs.
  However, a major limitation of GenCAD is its inability to consistently
produce feasible boundary representations (B-reps), with approximately 10% of
generated designs being infeasible. To address this, we propose
GenCAD-Self-Repairing, a framework that enhances the feasibility of generative
CAD models through diffusion guidance and a self-repairing pipeline. This
framework integrates a guided diffusion denoising process in the latent space
and a regression-based correction mechanism to refine infeasible CAD command
sequences while preserving geometric accuracy. Our approach successfully
converted two-thirds of infeasible designs in the baseline method into feasible
ones, significantly improving the feasibility rate while simultaneously
maintaining a reasonable level of geometric accuracy between the point clouds
of ground truth models and generated models.
  By significantly improving the feasibility rate of generating CAD models, our
approach helps expand the availability of high-quality training data and
enhances the applicability of AI-driven CAD generation in manufacturing,
architecture, and product design.

Abstract: This work explores the application of Federated Learning (FL) in Unsupervised
Semantic image Segmentation (USS). Recent USS methods extract pixel-level
features using frozen visual foundation models and refine them through
self-supervised objectives that encourage semantic grouping. These features are
then grouped to semantic clusters to produce segmentation masks. Extending
these ideas to federated settings requires feature representation and cluster
centroid alignment across distributed clients -- an inherently difficult task
under heterogeneous data distributions in the absence of supervision. To
address this, we propose FUSS Federated Unsupervised image Semantic
Segmentation) which is, to our knowledge, the first framework to enable fully
decentralized, label-free semantic segmentation training. FUSS introduces novel
federation strategies that promote global consistency in feature and prototype
space, jointly optimizing local segmentation heads and shared semantic
centroids. Experiments on both benchmark and real-world datasets, including
binary and multi-class segmentation tasks, show that FUSS consistently
outperforms local-only client trainings as well as extensions of classical FL
algorithms under varying client data distributions. To support reproducibility,
full code will be released upon manuscript acceptance.

TL;DR: TRACE是一种新方法，用于从扩散模型中擦除特定概念，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决扩散模型中生成不良内容（如敏感信息、版权风格）的问题，确保隐私、公平和安全。

Method: 结合理论框架和微调程序，通过更新交叉注意力层和轨迹感知微调目标，在扩散过程中抑制特定概念。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，TRACE表现优于现有方法（如ANT、EraseAnything和MACE），在擦除效果和输出质量上达到最优。

Conclusion: TRACE提供了一种有效且理论支持的方法，用于从扩散模型中擦除特定概念，同时保持生成质量。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have shown unprecedented generative
capability, but their ability to produce undesirable concepts
(e.g.~pornographic content, sensitive identities, copyrighted styles) poses
serious concerns for privacy, fairness, and safety. {Concept erasure} aims to
remove or suppress specific concept information in a generative model. In this
paper, we introduce \textbf{TRACE (Trajectory-Constrained Attentional Concept
Erasure)}, a novel method to erase targeted concepts from diffusion models
while preserving overall generative quality. Our approach combines a rigorous
theoretical framework, establishing formal conditions under which a concept can
be provably suppressed in the diffusion process, with an effective fine-tuning
procedure compatible with both conventional latent diffusion (Stable Diffusion)
and emerging rectified flow models (e.g.~FLUX). We first derive a closed-form
update to the model's cross-attention layers that removes hidden
representations of the target concept. We then introduce a trajectory-aware
finetuning objective that steers the denoising process away from the concept
only in the late sampling stages, thus maintaining the model's fidelity on
unrelated content. Empirically, we evaluate TRACE on multiple benchmarks used
in prior concept erasure studies (object classes, celebrity faces, artistic
styles, and explicit content from the I2P dataset). TRACE achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming recent methods such as ANT,
EraseAnything, and MACE in terms of removal efficacy and output quality.

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个针对行人属性识别（PAR）的对抗攻击与防御框架ASL-PAR，通过全局和局部攻击生成对抗噪声，并设计语义偏移防御策略，验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管PAR在深度学习推动下取得进展，但其抗干扰能力和潜在脆弱性尚未充分研究，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 基于预训练的CLIP框架，将图像分块嵌入特征，扩展属性为句子嵌入文本特征，通过多模态Transformer融合视觉与文本令牌，生成对抗噪声并进行防御。

Result: 在数字和物理领域的多个数据集上验证了攻击与防御策略的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的ASL-PAR框架为PAR的对抗攻击与防御提供了有效解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) is an indispensable task in
human-centered research and has made great progress in recent years with the
development of deep neural networks. However, the potential vulnerability and
anti-interference ability have still not been fully explored. To bridge this
gap, this paper proposes the first adversarial attack and defense framework for
pedestrian attribute recognition. Specifically, we exploit both global- and
patch-level attacks on the pedestrian images, based on the pre-trained
CLIP-based PAR framework. It first divides the input pedestrian image into
non-overlapping patches and embeds them into feature embeddings using a
projection layer. Meanwhile, the attribute set is expanded into sentences using
prompts and embedded into attribute features using a pre-trained CLIP text
encoder. A multi-modal Transformer is adopted to fuse the obtained vision and
text tokens, and a feed-forward network is utilized for attribute recognition.
Based on the aforementioned PAR framework, we adopt the adversarial semantic
and label-perturbation to generate the adversarial noise, termed ASL-PAR. We
also design a semantic offset defense strategy to suppress the influence of
adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments conducted on both digital domains
(i.e., PETA, PA100K, MSP60K, RAPv2) and physical domains fully validated the
effectiveness of our proposed adversarial attack and defense strategies for the
pedestrian attribute recognition. The source code of this paper will be
released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/OpenPAR.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索训练好的高维视频生成模型是否能有效支持低维任务（如可控图像生成），以挖掘视频模型的潜力。

Method: 提出DRA-Ctrl范式，包括基于mixup的过渡策略解决视频帧与图像生成的差异，以及改进的注意力结构和掩码机制以对齐文本提示与图像控制。

Result: 实验表明，改造后的视频模型在多种图像生成任务中表现优于直接训练的图像模型。

Conclusion: DRA-Ctrl展示了大规模视频生成器在更广泛视觉应用中的潜力，为跨模态统一生成模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Video generative models can be regarded as world simulators due to their
ability to capture dynamic, continuous changes inherent in real-world
environments. These models integrate high-dimensional information across
visual, temporal, spatial, and causal dimensions, enabling predictions of
subjects in various status. A natural and valuable research direction is to
explore whether a fully trained video generative model in high-dimensional
space can effectively support lower-dimensional tasks such as controllable
image generation. In this work, we propose a paradigm for video-to-image
knowledge compression and task adaptation, termed \textit{Dimension-Reduction
Attack} (\texttt{DRA-Ctrl}), which utilizes the strengths of video models,
including long-range context modeling and flatten full-attention, to perform
various generation tasks. Specially, to address the challenging gap between
continuous video frames and discrete image generation, we introduce a
mixup-based transition strategy that ensures smooth adaptation. Moreover, we
redesign the attention structure with a tailored masking mechanism to better
align text prompts with image-level control. Experiments across diverse image
generation tasks, such as subject-driven and spatially conditioned generation,
show that repurposed video models outperform those trained directly on images.
These results highlight the untapped potential of large-scale video generators
for broader visual applications. \texttt{DRA-Ctrl} provides new insights into
reusing resource-intensive video models and lays foundation for future unified
generative models across visual modalities. The project page is

Motivation: 研究如何通过RL微调生成模型，以更好地满足人类偏好，特别是在视觉生成任务中。

Method: 采用Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)微调视觉自回归模型，结合CLIP嵌入和美学预测器作为奖励信号。

Result: 模型能生成高质量图像并精确控制风格，还能泛化到预训练未见的风格。

Conclusion: RL微调对视觉自回归模型高效且有效，尤其适合在线采样场景。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained generative models with Reinforcement Learning (RL)
has emerged as an effective approach for aligning outputs more closely with
nuanced human preferences. In this paper, we investigate the application of
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to fine-tune next-scale visual
autoregressive (VAR) models. Our empirical results demonstrate that this
approach enables alignment to intricate reward signals derived from aesthetic
predictors and CLIP embeddings, significantly enhancing image quality and
enabling precise control over the generation style. Interestingly, by
leveraging CLIP, our method can help VAR models generalize beyond their initial
ImageNet distribution: through RL-driven exploration, these models can generate
images aligned with prompts referencing image styles that were absent during
pre-training. In summary, we show that RL-based fine-tuning is both efficient
and effective for VAR models, benefiting particularly from their fast inference
speeds, which are advantageous for online sampling, an aspect that poses
significant challenges for diffusion-based alternatives.

Motivation: 全切片图像（WSIs）在癌症诊断中至关重要，但其超大尺寸和细粒度标注的稀缺性给传统监督学习带来挑战。

Method: DSAGL采用双流设计，结合教师-学生架构，生成多尺度注意力伪标签，并通过共享轻量编码器（VSSMamba）和融合注意力模块（FASA）增强关键区域关注。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、NCT-CRC和TCGA-Lung数据集上，DSAGL表现优于现有MIL基线，具有更强的判别性能和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DSAGL在弱监督下显著提升了全切片图像的分类性能，为癌症诊断提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Whole-slide images (WSIs) are critical for cancer diagnosis due to their
ultra-high resolution and rich semantic content. However, their massive size
and the limited availability of fine-grained annotations pose substantial
challenges for conventional supervised learning. We propose DSAGL (Dual-Stream
Attention-Guided Learning), a novel weakly supervised classification framework
that combines a teacher-student architecture with a dual-stream design. DSAGL
explicitly addresses instance-level ambiguity and bag-level semantic
consistency by generating multi-scale attention-based pseudo labels and guiding
instance-level learning. A shared lightweight encoder (VSSMamba) enables
efficient long-range dependency modeling, while a fusion-attentive module
(FASA) enhances focus on sparse but diagnostically relevant regions. We further
introduce a hybrid loss to enforce mutual consistency between the two streams.
Experiments on CIFAR-10, NCT-CRC, and TCGA-Lung datasets demonstrate that DSAGL
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MIL baselines, achieving superior
discriminative performance and robustness under weak supervision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在采样过程中存在样本质量不一致的问题，现有方法（如DDPO和推理时对齐技术）计算成本高且依赖外部奖励信号，限制了其广泛应用。

Method: 研究发现样本质量与去噪轨迹中的累积分数差异（ASD）有强相关性，并基于此提出了CFG-Rejection方法，早期过滤低质量样本。

Result: 实验表明，CFG-Rejection在图像生成中显著提升了人类偏好分数（HPSv2, PickScore）和挑战性基准（GenEval, DPG-Bench）的表现。

Conclusion: CFG-Rejection是一种高效且兼容现有扩散框架的方法，有望在多种生成模态中实现更高效、可靠的高质量样本生成。

Abstract: Diffusion models often exhibit inconsistent sample quality due to stochastic
variations inherent in their sampling trajectories. Although training-based
fine-tuning (e.g. DDPO [1]) and inference-time alignment techniques[2] aim to
improve sample fidelity, they typically necessitate full denoising processes
and external reward signals. This incurs substantial computational costs,
hindering their broader applicability. In this work, we unveil an intriguing
phenomenon: a previously unobserved yet exploitable link between sample quality
and characteristics of the denoising trajectory during classifier-free guidance
(CFG). Specifically, we identify a strong correlation between high-density
regions of the sample distribution and the Accumulated Score Differences
(ASD)--the cumulative divergence between conditional and unconditional scores.
Leveraging this insight, we introduce CFG-Rejection, an efficient,
plug-and-play strategy that filters low-quality samples at an early stage of
the denoising process, crucially without requiring external reward signals or
model retraining. Importantly, our approach necessitates no modifications to
model architectures or sampling schedules and maintains full compatibility with
existing diffusion frameworks. We validate the effectiveness of CFG-Rejection
in image generation through extensive experiments, demonstrating marked
improvements on human preference scores (HPSv2, PickScore) and challenging
benchmarks (GenEval, DPG-Bench). We anticipate that CFG-Rejection will offer
significant advantages for diverse generative modalities beyond images, paving
the way for more efficient and reliable high-quality sample generation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Model-Aligned Coupling (MAC)的方法，通过结合几何距离和模型预测误差来优化训练耦合，从而生成更高质量的样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于几何距离的耦合方法（如最优传输）可能不符合模型的偏好轨迹，导致难以学习直线轨迹。

Method: MAC方法不仅考虑几何距离，还根据模型的预测误差选择耦合，并采用top-$k$策略减少计算成本。

Result: 实验表明，MAC在少步生成场景中显著提升了生成质量和效率。

Conclusion: MAC通过模型对齐的耦合策略，有效改进了生成模型的性能。

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) is an effective framework for training a model to learn a
vector field that transports samples from a source distribution to a target
distribution. To train the model, early FM methods use random couplings, which
often result in crossing paths and lead the model to learn non-straight
trajectories that require many integration steps to generate high-quality
samples. To address this, recent methods adopt Optimal Transport (OT) to
construct couplings by minimizing geometric distances, which helps reduce path
crossings. However, we observe that such geometry-based couplings do not
necessarily align with the model's preferred trajectories, making it difficult
to learn the vector field induced by these couplings, which prevents the model
from learning straight trajectories. Motivated by this, we propose
Model-Aligned Coupling (MAC), an effective method that matches training
couplings based not only on geometric distance but also on alignment with the
model's preferred transport directions based on its prediction error. To avoid
the time-costly match process, MAC proposes to select the top-$k$ fraction of
couplings with the lowest error for training. Extensive experiments show that
MAC significantly improves generation quality and efficiency in few-step
settings compared to existing methods. Project page:

Result: 模型在知识识别准确性和描述质量上均有显著提升，能够更好地泛化到未见过的知识概念。

Conclusion: KRCapVLM有效提升了生成知识丰富、上下文相关描述的能力。

Abstract: Generating informative and knowledge-rich image captions remains a challenge
for many existing captioning models, which often produce generic descriptions
that lack specificity and contextual depth. To address this limitation, we
propose KRCapVLM, a knowledge replay-based novel image captioning framework
using vision-language model. We incorporate beam search decoding to generate
more diverse and coherent captions. We also integrate attention-based modules
into the image encoder to enhance feature representation. Finally, we employ
training schedulers to improve stability and ensure smoother convergence during
training. These proposals accelerate substantial gains in both caption quality
and knowledge recognition. Our proposed model demonstrates clear improvements
in both the accuracy of knowledge recognition and the overall quality of
generated captions. It shows a stronger ability to generalize to previously
unseen knowledge concepts, producing more informative and contextually relevant
descriptions. These results indicate the effectiveness of our approach in
enhancing the model's capacity to generate meaningful, knowledge-grounded
captions across a range of scenarios.

Motivation: 现有视频理解领域缺乏能够展示长链思维推理优势的基准测试，且现有任务多为知识驱动而非视觉内容依赖。

Method: 提出VideoReasonBench基准测试，包含视觉丰富且高复杂度的视频推理任务，评估模型在三个逐步升级的推理技能上的表现。

Result: 评估18种先进多模态大语言模型，发现大多数表现不佳（如GPT-4o仅6.9%准确率），而Gemini-2.5-Pro以56.0%准确率显著领先。

Conclusion: 扩展思维预算对提升复杂视频推理性能至关重要，而现有视频基准测试未能体现这一优势。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning can
significantly enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) on
complex tasks. However, this benefit is yet to be demonstrated in the domain of
video understanding, since most existing benchmarks lack the reasoning depth
required to demonstrate the advantages of extended CoT chains. While recent
efforts have proposed benchmarks aimed at video reasoning, the tasks are often
knowledge-driven and do not rely heavily on visual content. To bridge this gap,
we introduce VideoReasonBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate vision-centric,
complex video reasoning. To ensure visual richness and high reasoning
complexity, each video in VideoReasonBench depicts a sequence of fine-grained
operations on a latent state that is only visible in part of the video. The
questions evaluate three escalating levels of video reasoning skills: recalling
observed visual information, inferring the content of latent states, and
predicting information beyond the video. Under such task setting, models have
to precisely recall multiple operations in the video, and perform step-by-step
reasoning to get correct final answers for these questions. Using
VideoReasonBench, we comprehensively evaluate 18 state-of-the-art multimodal
LLMs (MLLMs), finding that most perform poorly on complex video reasoning,
e.g., GPT-4o achieves only 6.9% accuracy, while the thinking-enhanced
Gemini-2.5-Pro significantly outperforms others with 56.0% accuracy. Our
investigations on "test-time scaling" further reveal that extended thinking
budget, while offering none or minimal benefits on existing video benchmarks,
is essential for improving the performance on VideoReasonBench.

Motivation: 多模态信息处理对图像分类性能提升至关重要，但传统方法难以捕捉模态间复杂依赖关系，限制了高精度分类任务的应用。

Method: MCFNet包含正则化集成融合模块（模态特定正则化策略）和多模态决策分类模块（混合损失函数加权投票）。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，MCFNet显著提升了分类准确率。

Conclusion: MCFNet能有效建模跨模态语义，适用于细粒度分类任务。

Abstract: Multimodal information processing has become increasingly important for
enhancing image classification performance. However, the intricate and implicit
dependencies across different modalities often hinder conventional methods from
effectively capturing fine-grained semantic interactions, thereby limiting
their applicability in high-precision classification tasks. To address this
issue, we propose a novel Multimodal Collaborative Fusion Network (MCFNet)
designed for fine-grained classification. The proposed MCFNet architecture
incorporates a regularized integrated fusion module that improves intra-modal
feature representation through modality-specific regularization strategies,
while facilitating precise semantic alignment via a hybrid attention mechanism.
Additionally, we introduce a multimodal decision classification module, which
jointly exploits inter-modal correlations and unimodal discriminative features
by integrating multiple loss functions within a weighted voting paradigm.
Extensive experiments and ablation studies on benchmark datasets demonstrate
that the proposed MCFNet framework achieves consistent improvements in
classification accuracy, confirming its effectiveness in modeling subtle
cross-modal semantics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决PAN和MS图像因传感器位置、采集时间和分辨率差异导致的跨模态不对齐问题，避免传统方法因假设完美对齐而导致的频谱失真和模糊。

Method: 提出模态自适应重建（MARs）联合重建HRMS和PAN图像，并引入跨模态对齐感知注意力（CM3A）双向对齐特征。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现优于现有方法，推理速度快50.11倍，内存占用减少0.63倍，且在未见卫星数据集上表现稳健。

Conclusion: PAN-Crafter通过模态一致性对齐和自适应特征细化，显著提升了图像融合的性能和效率。

Abstract: PAN-sharpening aims to fuse high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) images with
low-resolution multi-spectral (MS) images to generate high-resolution
multi-spectral (HRMS) outputs. However, cross-modality misalignment -- caused
by sensor placement, acquisition timing, and resolution disparity -- induces a
fundamental challenge. Conventional deep learning methods assume perfect
pixel-wise alignment and rely on per-pixel reconstruction losses, leading to
spectral distortion, double edges, and blurring when misalignment is present.
To address this, we propose PAN-Crafter, a modality-consistent alignment
framework that explicitly mitigates the misalignment gap between PAN and MS
modalities. At its core, Modality-Adaptive Reconstruction (MARs) enables a
single network to jointly reconstruct HRMS and PAN images, leveraging PAN's
high-frequency details as auxiliary self-supervision. Additionally, we
introduce Cross-Modality Alignment-Aware Attention (CM3A), a novel mechanism
that bidirectionally aligns MS texture to PAN structure and vice versa,
enabling adaptive feature refinement across modalities. Extensive experiments
on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our PAN-Crafter outperforms the
most recent state-of-the-art method in all metrics, even with 50.11$\times$
faster inference time and 0.63$\times$ the memory size. Furthermore, it
demonstrates strong generalization performance on unseen satellite datasets,
showing its robustness across different conditions.

Result: 在Show-o和Janus上分别达到GenEval分数0.77和0.65。

Conclusion: UniRL无需外部数据，提升任务性能并减少任务间不平衡，仅需少量额外训练步骤。

Abstract: Unified multimodal large language models such as Show-o and Janus have
achieved strong performance across both generation and understanding tasks.
However, these models typically rely on large-scale datasets and require
substantial computation during the pretraining stage. In addition, several
post-training methods have been proposed, but they often depend on external
data or are limited to task-specific customization. In this work, we introduce
UniRL, a self-improving post-training approach. Our approach enables the model
to generate images from prompts and use them as training data in each
iteration, without relying on any external image data. Moreover, it enables the
two tasks to enhance each other: the generated images are used for
understanding, and the understanding results are used to supervise generation.
We explore supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) to optimize the models. UniRL offers three key advantages: (1) it
requires no external image data, as all training samples are generated by the
model itself during training; (2) it not only improves individual task
performance, but also reduces the imbalance between generation and
understanding; and (3) it requires only several additional training steps
during the post-training stage. We evaluate UniRL on top of Show-o and Janus,
achieving a GenEval score of 0.77 for Show-o and 0.65 for Janus. Code and
models will be released in https://github.com/showlab/UniRL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NSFW内容在社交网络上泛滥，现有检测方法难以应对复杂语义和多样化规则，亟需改进。

Method: 提出VModA框架，结合多样化审核规则和复杂语义处理能力，通过实验验证其性能。

Result: VModA在NSFW检测中表现优异，准确率提升54.3%，并展示出跨类别和场景的强适应性。

Conclusion: VModA有效解决了NSFW内容检测的挑战，并在实际场景中验证了其实用性。

Abstract: Not Safe/Suitable for Work (NSFW) content is rampant on social networks and
poses serious harm to citizens, especially minors. Current detection methods
mainly rely on deep learning-based image recognition and classification.
However, NSFW images are now presented in increasingly sophisticated ways,
often using image details and complex semantics to obscure their true nature or
attract more views. Although still understandable to humans, these images often
evade existing detection methods, posing a significant threat. Further
complicating the issue, varying regulations across platforms and regions create
additional challenges for effective moderation, leading to detection bias and
reduced accuracy. To address this, we propose VModA, a general and effective
framework that adapts to diverse moderation rules and handles complex,
semantically rich NSFW content across categories. Experimental results show
that VModA significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving up to a 54.3%
accuracy improvement across NSFW types, including those with complex semantics.
Further experiments demonstrate that our method exhibits strong adaptability
across categories, scenarios, and base VLMs. We also identified inconsistent
and controversial label samples in public NSFW benchmark datasets, re-annotated
them, and submitted corrections to the original maintainers. Two datasets have
confirmed the updates so far. Additionally, we evaluate VModA in real-world
scenarios to demonstrate its practical effectiveness.

Conclusion: 该方法仅需少量标注即可实现高效泛化，为临床自动化伤口评分提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Purpose: Accurate wound segmentation is essential for automated DESIGN-R
scoring. However, existing models such as FUSegNet, which are trained primarily
on foot ulcer datasets, often fail to generalize to wounds on other body sites.
  Methods: We propose an annotation-efficient pipeline that combines a
lightweight YOLOv11n-based detector with the pre-trained FUSegNet segmentation
model. Instead of relying on pixel-level annotations or retraining for new
anatomical regions, our method achieves robust performance using only 500
manually labeled bounding boxes. This zero fine-tuning approach effectively
bridges the domain gap and enables direct deployment across diverse wound
types. This is an advance not previously demonstrated in the wound segmentation
literature.
  Results: Evaluated on three real-world test sets spanning foot, sacral, and
trochanter wounds, our YOLO plus FUSegNet pipeline improved mean IoU by 23
percentage points over vanilla FUSegNet and increased end-to-end DESIGN-R size
estimation accuracy from 71 percent to 94 percent (see Table 3 for details).
  Conclusion: Our pipeline generalizes effectively across body sites without
task-specific fine-tuning, demonstrating that minimal supervision, with 500
annotated ROIs, is sufficient for scalable, annotation-light wound
segmentation. This capability paves the way for real-world DESIGN-R automation,
reducing reliance on pixel-wise labeling, streamlining documentation workflows,
and supporting objective and consistent wound scoring in clinical practice. We
will publicly release the trained detector weights and configuration to promote
reproducibility and facilitate downstream deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在CAD图纸的全景符号识别中存在高计算成本、通用性差和几何信息丢失的问题，需要一种更高效且保留几何结构的方法。

Method: 提出VecFormer，采用线表示原始图形，保留几何连续性，并引入分支融合细化模块整合实例和语义预测。

Result: 实验显示VecFormer在PQ指标上达到91.1，Stuff-PQ分别提升9.6和21.2分，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 线表示是矢量图形理解的有效基础，VecFormer在性能和通用性上表现突出。

Abstract: We study the task of panoptic symbol spotting, which involves identifying
both individual instances of countable things and the semantic regions of
uncountable stuff in computer-aided design (CAD) drawings composed of vector
graphical primitives. Existing methods typically rely on image rasterization,
graph construction, or point-based representation, but these approaches often
suffer from high computational costs, limited generality, and loss of geometric
structural information. In this paper, we propose VecFormer, a novel method
that addresses these challenges through line-based representation of
primitives. This design preserves the geometric continuity of the original
primitive, enabling more accurate shape representation while maintaining a
computation-friendly structure, making it well-suited for vector graphic
understanding tasks. To further enhance prediction reliability, we introduce a
Branch Fusion Refinement module that effectively integrates instance and
semantic predictions, resolving their inconsistencies for more coherent
panoptic outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method establishes
a new state-of-the-art, achieving 91.1 PQ, with Stuff-PQ improved by 9.6 and
21.2 points over the second-best results under settings with and without prior
information, respectively, highlighting the strong potential of line-based
representation as a foundation for vector graphic understanding.

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法，尤其在复杂结构和重叠物体场景中。

Conclusion: BriGeS是一种高效且泛化能力强的MDE方法。

Abstract: We present Bridging Geometric and Semantic (BriGeS), an effective method that
fuses geometric and semantic information within foundation models to enhance
Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE). Central to BriGeS is the Bridging Gate, which
integrates the complementary strengths of depth and segmentation foundation
models. This integration is further refined by our Attention Temperature
Scaling technique. It finely adjusts the focus of the attention mechanisms to
prevent over-concentration on specific features, thus ensuring balanced
performance across diverse inputs. BriGeS capitalizes on pre-trained foundation
models and adopts a strategy that focuses on training only the Bridging Gate.
This method significantly reduces resource demands and training time while
maintaining the model's ability to generalize effectively. Extensive
experiments across multiple challenging datasets demonstrate that BriGeS
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in MDE for complex scenes, effectively
handling intricate structures and overlapping objects.

Result: 在多个基准测试中，EdiDub显著提升了身份保留和同步性，并在人类评估中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 内容感知编辑方法在保留复杂视觉元素和准确唇同步方面优于传统生成或修复方法。

Abstract: Visual dubbing, the synchronization of facial movements with new speech, is
crucial for making content accessible across different languages, enabling
broader global reach. However, current methods face significant limitations.
Existing approaches often generate talking faces, hindering seamless
integration into original scenes, or employ inpainting techniques that discard
vital visual information like partial occlusions and lighting variations. This
work introduces EdiDub, a novel framework that reformulates visual dubbing as a
content-aware editing task. EdiDub preserves the original video context by
utilizing a specialized conditioning scheme to ensure faithful and accurate
modifications rather than mere copying. On multiple benchmarks, including a
challenging occluded-lip dataset, EdiDub significantly improves identity
preservation and synchronization. Human evaluations further confirm its
superiority, achieving higher synchronization and visual naturalness scores
compared to the leading methods. These results demonstrate that our
content-aware editing approach outperforms traditional generation or
inpainting, particularly in maintaining complex visual elements while ensuring
accurate lip synchronization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经渲染方法局限于内插视图合成，无法处理训练相机分布外的外推视图，限制了城市重建的通用性。

Method: 设计UrbanCraft，利用分层语义几何表示（如占用网格和3D边界框）作为先验，提出HSG-VSD方法结合语义和几何约束优化视图合成。

Result: 定性和定量实验证明UrbanCraft在外推视图合成问题上的有效性。

Conclusion: UrbanCraft通过分层语义几何先验和HSG-VSD方法，显著提升了外推视图合成的性能。

Abstract: Existing neural rendering-based urban scene reconstruction methods mainly
focus on the Interpolated View Synthesis (IVS) setting that synthesizes from
views close to training camera trajectory. However, IVS can not guarantee the
on-par performance of the novel view outside the training camera distribution
(\textit{e.g.}, looking left, right, or downwards), which limits the
generalizability of the urban reconstruction application. Previous methods have
optimized it via image diffusion, but they fail to handle text-ambiguous or
large unseen view angles due to coarse-grained control of text-only diffusion.
In this paper, we design UrbanCraft, which surmounts the Extrapolated View
Synthesis (EVS) problem using hierarchical sem-geometric representations
serving as additional priors. Specifically, we leverage the partially
observable scene to reconstruct coarse semantic and geometric primitives,
establishing a coarse scene-level prior through an occupancy grid as the base
representation. Additionally, we incorporate fine instance-level priors from 3D
bounding boxes to enhance object-level details and spatial relationships.
Building on this, we propose the \textbf{H}ierarchical
\textbf{S}emantic-Geometric-\textbf{G}uided Variational Score Distillation
(HSG-VSD), which integrates semantic and geometric constraints from pretrained
UrbanCraft2D into the score distillation sampling process, forcing the
distribution to be consistent with the observable scene. Qualitative and
quantitative comparisons demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on EVS
problem.

Result: 在PASCAL VOC 2012、Cityscapes和COCO等基准数据集上，ASAug显著提升现有方法性能，达到SOTA。

Conclusion: 空间增强在半监督语义分割中有效，自适应策略进一步提升了模型泛化能力。

Abstract: In semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS), data augmentation plays a
crucial role in the weak-to-strong consistency regularization framework, as it
enhances diversity and improves model generalization. Recent strong
augmentation methods have primarily focused on intensity-based perturbations,
which have minimal impact on the semantic masks. In contrast, spatial
augmentations like translation and rotation have long been acknowledged for
their effectiveness in supervised semantic segmentation tasks, but they are
often ignored in SSSS. In this work, we demonstrate that spatial augmentation
can also contribute to model training in SSSS, despite generating inconsistent
masks between the weak and strong augmentations. Furthermore, recognizing the
variability among images, we propose an adaptive augmentation strategy that
dynamically adjusts the augmentation for each instance based on entropy.
Extensive experiments show that our proposed Adaptive Spatial Augmentation
(\textbf{ASAug}) can be integrated as a pluggable module, consistently
improving the performance of existing methods and achieving state-of-the-art
results on benchmark datasets such as PASCAL VOC 2012, Cityscapes, and COCO.

Conclusion: VITON-DRR方法显著提升了虚拟试穿的效果，适用于多样化的姿势和复杂场景。

Abstract: Image-based virtual try-on aims to fit a target garment to a specific person
image and has attracted extensive research attention because of its huge
application potential in the e-commerce and fashion industries. To generate
high-quality try-on results, accurately warping the clothing item to fit the
human body plays a significant role, as slight misalignment may lead to
unrealistic artifacts in the fitting image. Most existing methods warp the
clothing by feature matching and thin-plate spline (TPS). However, it often
fails to preserve clothing details due to self-occlusion, severe misalignment
between poses, etc. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a detail
retention virtual try-on method via accurate non-rigid registration (VITON-DRR)
for diverse human poses. Specifically, we reconstruct a human semantic
segmentation using a dual-pyramid-structured feature extractor. Then, a novel
Deformation Module is designed for extracting the cloth key points and warping
them through an accurate non-rigid registration algorithm. Finally, the Image
Synthesis Module is designed to synthesize the deformed garment image and
generate the human pose information adaptively. {Compared with} traditional
methods, the proposed VITON-DRR can make the deformation of fitting images more
accurate and retain more garment details. The experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed method performs better than state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) offers near-atomic resolution imaging of
macromolecules, but developing robust models for downstream analysis is
hindered by the scarcity of high-quality annotated data. While synthetic data
generation has emerged as a potential solution, existing methods often fail to
capture both the structural diversity of biological specimens and the complex,
spatially varying noise inherent in cryo-EM imaging. To overcome these
limitations, we propose CryoCCD, a synthesis framework that integrates
biophysical modeling with generative techniques. Specifically, CryoCCD produces
multi-scale cryo-EM micrographs that reflect realistic biophysical variability
through compositional heterogeneity, cellular context, and physics-informed
imaging. To generate realistic noise, we employ a conditional diffusion model,
enhanced by cycle consistency to preserve structural fidelity and mask-aware
contrastive learning to capture spatially adaptive noise patterns. Extensive
experiments show that CryoCCD generates structurally accurate micrographs and
enhances performance in downstream tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art
baselines in both particle picking and reconstruction.

Motivation: 现有两阶段SGG框架因因果链结构导致虚假相关性，表现为头尾关系和前景背景关系的预测偏差，尤其是后者较少被讨论。

Method: 提出RcSGG框架，包括主动反向估计（ARE）干预混淆变量和最大信息采样（MIS）增强反向因果估计。

Result: 在多个基准测试和SGG框架中实现了最先进的平均召回率。

Conclusion: RcSGG有效缓解了SGG中的虚假相关性，显著减少了预测偏差。

Abstract: Existing two-stage Scene Graph Generation (SGG) frameworks typically
incorporate a detector to extract relationship features and a classifier to
categorize these relationships; therefore, the training paradigm follows a
causal chain structure, where the detector's inputs determine the classifier's
inputs, which in turn influence the final predictions. However, such a causal
chain structure can yield spurious correlations between the detector's inputs
and the final predictions, i.e., the prediction of a certain relationship may
be influenced by other relationships. This influence can induce at least two
observable biases: tail relationships are predicted as head ones, and
foreground relationships are predicted as background ones; notably, the latter
bias is seldom discussed in the literature. To address this issue, we propose
reconstructing the causal chain structure into a reverse causal structure,
wherein the classifier's inputs are treated as the confounder, and both the
detector's inputs and the final predictions are viewed as causal variables.
Specifically, we term the reconstructed causal paradigm as the Reverse causal
Framework for SGG (RcSGG). RcSGG initially employs the proposed Active Reverse
Estimation (ARE) to intervene on the confounder to estimate the reverse
causality, \ie the causality from final predictions to the classifier's inputs.
Then, the Maximum Information Sampling (MIS) is suggested to enhance the
reverse causality estimation further by considering the relationship
information. Theoretically, RcSGG can mitigate the spurious correlations
inherent in the SGG framework, subsequently eliminating the induced biases.
Comprehensive experiments on popular benchmarks and diverse SGG frameworks show
the state-of-the-art mean recall rate.

Result: 实验表明LAFR在合成和真实数据集上均能高效实现高质量、身份保持的人脸恢复。

Conclusion: LAFR提供了一种高效且有效的方法，解决了低质量图像恢复中的语义对齐和计算成本问题。

Abstract: Blind face restoration from low-quality (LQ) images is a challenging task
that requires not only high-fidelity image reconstruction but also the
preservation of facial identity. While diffusion models like Stable Diffusion
have shown promise in generating high-quality (HQ) images, their VAE modules
are typically trained only on HQ data, resulting in semantic misalignment when
encoding LQ inputs. This mismatch significantly weakens the effectiveness of LQ
conditions during the denoising process. Existing approaches often tackle this
issue by retraining the VAE encoder, which is computationally expensive and
memory-intensive. To address this limitation efficiently, we propose LAFR
(Latent Alignment for Face Restoration), a novel codebook-based latent space
adapter that aligns the latent distribution of LQ images with that of HQ
counterparts, enabling semantically consistent diffusion sampling without
altering the original VAE. To further enhance identity preservation, we
introduce a multi-level restoration loss that combines constraints from
identity embeddings and facial structural priors. Additionally, by leveraging
the inherent structural regularity of facial images, we show that lightweight
finetuning of diffusion prior on just 0.9% of FFHQ dataset is sufficient to
achieve results comparable to state-of-the-art methods, reduce training time by
70%. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world face restoration
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of LAFR, achieving
high-quality, identity-preserving face reconstruction from severely degraded
inputs.

Result: 实验表明，基于AURC的损失函数在多数据集和模型架构中表现出色，校准性能优于焦点损失。

Conclusion: 正则化AURC优化是一种更灵活且有效的校准方法，逆焦点损失的加权策略更具理论依据。

Abstract: Several variants of reweighted risk functionals, such as focal losss, inverse
focal loss, and the Area Under the Risk-Coverage Curve (AURC), have been
proposed in the literature and claims have been made in relation to their
calibration properties. However, focal loss and inverse focal loss propose
vastly different weighting schemes. In this paper, we revisit a broad class of
weighted risk functions commonly used in deep learning and establish a
principled connection between these reweighting schemes and calibration errors.
We show that minimizing calibration error is closely linked to the selective
classification paradigm and demonstrate that optimizing a regularized variant
of the AURC naturally leads to improved calibration. This regularized AURC
shares a similar reweighting strategy with inverse focal loss, lending support
to the idea that focal loss is less principled when calibration is a desired
outcome. Direct AURC optimization offers greater flexibility through the choice
of confidence score functions (CSFs). To enable gradient-based optimization, we
introduce a differentiable formulation of the regularized AURC using the
SoftRank technique. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our AURC-based loss
achieves competitive class-wise calibration performance across a range of
datasets and model architectures.

Conclusion: DACPO为解决大规模非封闭点云定向问题提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Orienting point clouds is a fundamental problem in computer graphics and 3D
vision, with applications in reconstruction, segmentation, and analysis. While
significant progress has been made, existing approaches mainly focus on
watertight, object-level 3D models. The orientation of large-scale,
non-watertight 3D scenes remains an underexplored challenge. To address this
gap, we propose DACPO (Divide-And-Conquer Point Orientation), a novel framework
that leverages a divide-and-conquer strategy for scalable and robust point
cloud orientation. Rather than attempting to orient an unbounded scene at once,
DACPO segments the input point cloud into smaller, manageable blocks, processes
each block independently, and integrates the results through a global
optimization stage. For each block, we introduce a two-step process: estimating
initial normal orientations by a randomized greedy method and refining them by
an adapted iterative Poisson surface reconstruction. To achieve consistency
across blocks, we model inter-block relationships using an an undirected graph,
where nodes represent blocks and edges connect spatially adjacent blocks. To
reliably evaluate orientation consistency between adjacent blocks, we introduce
the concept of the visible connected region, which defines the region over
which visibility-based assessments are performed. The global integration is
then formulated as a 0-1 integer-constrained optimization problem, with block
flip states as binary variables. Despite the combinatorial nature of the
problem, DACPO remains scalable by limiting the number of blocks (typically a
few hundred for 3D scenes) involved in the optimization. Experiments on
benchmark datasets demonstrate DACPO's strong performance, particularly in
challenging large-scale, non-watertight scenarios where existing methods often
fail. The source code is available at https://github.com/zd-lee/DACPO.

Result: TimePoint在速度和准确性上均优于标准DTW，且仅需合成数据即可泛化到真实时间序列。

Conclusion: TimePoint为时间序列分析提供了一种快速、准确且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Fast and scalable alignment of time series is a fundamental challenge in many
domains. The standard solution, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), struggles with poor
scalability and sensitivity to noise. We introduce TimePoint, a self-supervised
method that dramatically accelerates DTW-based alignment while typically
improving alignment accuracy by learning keypoints and descriptors from
synthetic data. Inspired by 2D keypoint detection but carefully adapted to the
unique challenges of 1D signals, TimePoint leverages efficient 1D
diffeomorphisms, which effectively model nonlinear time warping, to generate
realistic training data. This approach, along with fully convolutional and
wavelet convolutional architectures, enables the extraction of informative
keypoints and descriptors. Applying DTW to these sparse representations yield
major speedups and typically higher alignment accuracy than standard DTW
applied to the full signals. TimePoint demonstrates strong generalization to
real-world time series when trained solely on synthetic data, and further
improves with fine-tuning on real data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
TimePoint consistently achieves faster and more accurate alignments than
standard DTW, making it a scalable solution for time-series analysis. Our code

Abstract: PhysicsNeRF is a physically grounded framework for 3D reconstruction from

cross-view alignment. While standard NeRFs fail under sparse supervision,
PhysicsNeRF employs a compact 0.67M-parameter architecture and achieves 21.4 dB
average PSNR using only 8 views, outperforming prior methods. A generalization
gap of 5.7-6.2 dB is consistently observed and analyzed, revealing fundamental
limitations of sparse-view reconstruction. PhysicsNeRF enables physically
consistent, generalizable 3D representations for agent interaction and
simulation, and clarifies the expressiveness-generalization trade-off in
constrained NeRF models.

Abstract: Video captions play a crucial role in text-to-video generation tasks, as
their quality directly influences the semantic coherence and visual fidelity of

annotated across 21 fine-grained dimensions (e.g., camera movement, and shot
type) that are empirically proven critical for text-to-video generation. We
further introduce three metrics (Accuracy (AR), Inconsistency Rate (IR),
Coverage Rate (CR)), and an automated evaluation pipeline leveraging large
language model (LLM) to verify caption quality via contrastive QA-pairs
analysis. By providing actionable insights for caption optimization, our
benchmark can advance the development of robust text-to-video models. The

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: R2I-Bench是一个专门评估文本到图像（T2I）生成中推理能力的基准，包含多类推理任务，并通过R2IScore指标进行细粒度评估。实验显示当前T2I模型的推理能力有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2I模型在生成逼真图像方面表现优异，但推理能力不足且缺乏系统评估。

Method: 提出R2I-Bench基准和R2IScore指标，涵盖多类推理任务，并通过实验评估16种T2I模型。

Result: 实验结果表明当前T2I模型的推理能力普遍有限。

Conclusion: 未来T2I系统需要更强大的推理感知架构。

Abstract: Reasoning is a fundamental capability often required in real-world
text-to-image (T2I) generation, e.g., generating ``a bitten apple that has been
left in the air for more than a week`` necessitates understanding temporal
decay and commonsense concepts. While recent T2I models have made impressive
progress in producing photorealistic images, their reasoning capability remains
underdeveloped and insufficiently evaluated. To bridge this gap, we introduce
R2I-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to rigorously assess
reasoning-driven T2I generation. R2I-Bench comprises meticulously curated data
instances, spanning core reasoning categories, including commonsense,
mathematical, logical, compositional, numerical, causal, and concept mixing. To
facilitate fine-grained evaluation, we design R2IScore, a QA-style metric based
on instance-specific, reasoning-oriented evaluation questions that assess three
critical dimensions: text-image alignment, reasoning accuracy, and image
quality. Extensive experiments with 16 representative T2I models, including a
strong pipeline-based framework that decouples reasoning and generation using
the state-of-the-art language and image generation models, demonstrate
consistently limited reasoning performance, highlighting the need for more
robust, reasoning-aware architectures in the next generation of T2I systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的数据高效框架VAU-R1，通过强化微调（RFT）提升视频异常理解（VAU）的推理能力，并推出了首个针对视频异常推理的链式思维基准VAU-Bench。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频异常理解（VAU）在智能城市、安全监控等领域至关重要，但现有方法缺乏可解释性且难以捕捉异常事件的因果和上下文关系，同时缺乏评估推理能力的综合基准。

Method: 提出VAU-R1框架，基于MLLMs并通过RFT增强异常推理；同时推出VAU-Bench基准，包含多选题、详细解释、时间标注和描述性标题。

Result: 实验表明，VAU-R1显著提高了问答准确性、时间定位和推理连贯性。

Conclusion: VAU-R1和VAU-Bench为可解释且注重推理的视频异常理解奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Understanding (VAU) is essential for applications such as smart
cities, security surveillance, and disaster alert systems, yet remains
challenging due to its demand for fine-grained spatio-temporal perception and
robust reasoning under ambiguity. Despite advances in anomaly detection,
existing methods often lack interpretability and struggle to capture the causal
and contextual aspects of abnormal events. This limitation is further
compounded by the absence of comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating reasoning
ability in anomaly scenarios. To address both challenges, we introduce VAU-R1,
a data-efficient framework built upon Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs),
which enhances anomaly reasoning through Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT).
Besides, we propose VAU-Bench, the first Chain-of-Thought benchmark tailored
for video anomaly reasoning, featuring multiple-choice QA, detailed rationales,
temporal annotations, and descriptive captions. Empirical results show that
VAU-R1 significantly improves question answering accuracy, temporal grounding,
and reasoning coherence across diverse contexts. Together, our method and
benchmark establish a strong foundation for interpretable and reasoning-aware
video anomaly understanding. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有地球科学多模态学习基准在系统覆盖和评估维度上存在局限，无法全面评估跨领域交互。

Method: 利用卫星和实地观测数据，整合29,779个标注，涵盖感知、推理和科学知识推理等四个层次，通过专家和众包协作减少标注歧义。

Result: 实验显示，9个最先进的多模态模型在基准测试中表现不佳，最高准确率低于35%，某些任务中GPT-4o准确率为0%。

Conclusion: OmniEarth-Bench为地球科学AI设立了新标准，推动了科学发现和环境监测的实际应用。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for Earth science multimodal learning exhibit critical
limitations in systematic coverage of geosystem components and cross-sphere
interactions, often constrained to isolated subsystems (only in
Human-activities sphere or atmosphere) with limited evaluation dimensions (less
than 16 tasks). To address these gaps, we introduce OmniEarth-Bench, the first
comprehensive multimodal benchmark spanning all six Earth science spheres
(atmosphere, lithosphere, Oceansphere, cryosphere, biosphere and
Human-activities sphere) and cross-spheres with one hundred expert-curated
evaluation dimensions. Leveraging observational data from satellite sensors and
in-situ measurements, OmniEarth-Bench integrates 29,779 annotations across four
tiers: perception, general reasoning, scientific knowledge reasoning and
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. This involves the efforts of 2-5 experts per
sphere to establish authoritative evaluation dimensions and curate relevant
observational datasets, 40 crowd-sourcing annotators to assist experts for
annotations, and finally, OmniEarth-Bench is validated via hybrid expert-crowd
workflows to reduce label ambiguity. Experiments on 9 state-of-the-art MLLMs
reveal that even the most advanced models struggle with our benchmarks, where
none of them reach 35\% accuracy. Especially, in some cross-spheres tasks, the
performance of leading models like GPT-4o drops to 0.0\%. OmniEarth-Bench sets
a new standard for geosystem-aware AI, advancing both scientific discovery and
practical applications in environmental monitoring and disaster prediction. The
dataset, source code, and trained models were released.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于CLIP辅助的跨视图视听增强无监督时间动作定位方法，解决了现有方法过度依赖高区分性区域和单一视觉模态的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监督或弱监督方法依赖标注数据，耗时耗力；无监督方法面临特征过度聚焦和模态单一的问题。

Method: 结合视觉语言预训练和分类预训练协作增强，引入音频感知，采用自监督跨视图学习范式。

Result: 在两个公开数据集上表现优于多个先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过多模态协作和自监督学习，显著提升了无监督时间动作定位的性能。

Abstract: Temporal Action Localization (TAL) has garnered significant attention in
information retrieval. Existing supervised or weakly supervised methods heavily
rely on labeled temporal boundaries and action categories, which are
labor-intensive and time-consuming. Consequently, unsupervised temporal action
localization (UTAL) has gained popularity. However, current methods face two
main challenges: 1) Classification pre-trained features overly focus on highly
discriminative regions; 2) Solely relying on visual modality information makes
it difficult to determine contextual boundaries. To address these issues, we
propose a CLIP-assisted cross-view audiovisual enhanced UTAL method.
Specifically, we introduce visual language pre-training (VLP) and
classification pre-training-based collaborative enhancement to avoid excessive
focus on highly discriminative regions; we also incorporate audio perception to
provide richer contextual boundary information. Finally, we introduce a
self-supervised cross-view learning paradigm to achieve multi-view perceptual
enhancement without additional annotations. Extensive experiments on two public
datasets demonstrate our model's superiority over several state-of-the-art
competitors.

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了肖像动画中的关键问题，并在实验中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Generating highly dynamic and photorealistic portrait animations driven by
audio and skeletal motion remains challenging due to the need for precise lip
synchronization, natural facial expressions, and high-fidelity body motion
dynamics. We propose a human-preference-aligned diffusion framework that
addresses these challenges through two key innovations. First, we introduce
direct preference optimization tailored for human-centric animation, leveraging
a curated dataset of human preferences to align generated outputs with
perceptual metrics for portrait motion-video alignment and naturalness of
expression. Second, the proposed temporal motion modulation resolves
spatiotemporal resolution mismatches by reshaping motion conditions into
dimensionally aligned latent features through temporal channel redistribution
and proportional feature expansion, preserving the fidelity of high-frequency
motion details in diffusion-based synthesis. The proposed mechanism is
complementary to existing UNet and DiT-based portrait diffusion approaches, and
experiments demonstrate obvious improvements in lip-audio synchronization,
expression vividness, body motion coherence over baseline methods, alongside
notable gains in human preference metrics. Our model and source code can be

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文化遗产数字化的元数据不足限制了其可访问性和跨机构协作，现有视觉分析模型对特定领域（如手稿）的应用有限。

Method: 提出MEM框架，结合计算机视觉模型、大语言模型和知识图谱，创新性地引入Multilayer Vision Mechanism (MVM)动态检测嵌套特征。

Result: 在Jagiellonian数字图书馆的数字化古籍数据集上验证MEM，并发布105页手稿的标注数据集，展示其实际应用潜力。

Conclusion: MEM为文化遗产研究提供了一种灵活可扩展的方法，推动了人工智能与语义网技术的实际应用。

Abstract: The digitization of cultural heritage collections has opened new directions
for research, yet the lack of enriched metadata poses a substantial challenge
to accessibility, interoperability, and cross-institutional collaboration. In
several past years neural networks models such as YOLOv11 and Detectron2 have
revolutionized visual data analysis, but their application to domain-specific
cultural artifacts - such as manuscripts and incunabula - remains limited by
the absence of methodologies that address structural feature extraction and
semantic interoperability. In this position paper, we argue, that the
integration of neural networks with semantic technologies represents a paradigm
shift in cultural heritage digitization processes. We present the Metadata
Enrichment Model (MEM), a conceptual framework designed to enrich metadata for
digitized collections by combining fine-tuned computer vision models, large
language models (LLMs) and structured knowledge graphs. The Multilayer Vision
Mechanism (MVM) appears as the key innovation of MEM. This iterative process
improves visual analysis by dynamically detecting nested features, such as text
within seals or images within stamps. To expose MEM's potential, we apply it to
a dataset of digitized incunabula from the Jagiellonian Digital Library and
release a manually annotated dataset of 105 manuscript pages. We examine the
practical challenges of MEM's usage in real-world GLAM institutions, including
the need for domain-specific fine-tuning, the adjustment of enriched metadata
with Linked Data standards and computational costs. We present MEM as a
flexible and extensible methodology. This paper contributes to the discussion
on how artificial intelligence and semantic web technologies can advance
cultural heritage research, and also use these technologies in practice.

TL;DR: Qwen-LA通过引入视觉-文本反思过程，减少视觉语言模型中的幻觉现象，提升推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长推理过程会稀释视觉信息，导致注意力分散和幻觉问题，现有文本反思方法不足以解决。

Method: 提出Qwen-LA模型，结合BRPO强化学习方法，动态决定何时进行视觉-文本反思，并通过Visual Token COPY和ROUTE强制模型重新关注视觉信息。

Result: 实验表明，Qwen-LA在多个视觉问答数据集上表现优异，同时减少幻觉现象。

Conclusion: Qwen-LA通过视觉-文本反思和视觉信息补充，有效提升视觉语言推理模型的性能和可靠性。

Abstract: Inference time scaling drives extended reasoning to enhance the performance
of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), thus forming powerful Vision-Language
Reasoning Models (VLRMs). However, long reasoning dilutes visual tokens,
causing visual information to receive less attention and may trigger
hallucinations. Although introducing text-only reflection processes shows
promise in language models, we demonstrate that it is insufficient to suppress
hallucinations in VLMs. To address this issue, we introduce Qwen-LookAgain
(Qwen-LA), a novel VLRM designed to mitigate hallucinations by incorporating a
vision-text reflection process that guides the model to re-attention visual
information during reasoning. We first propose a reinforcement learning method
Balanced Reflective Policy Optimization (BRPO), which guides the model to
decide when to generate vision-text reflection on its own and balance the
number and length of reflections. Then, we formally prove that VLRMs lose
attention to visual tokens as reasoning progresses, and demonstrate that
supplementing visual information during reflection enhances visual attention.
Therefore, during training and inference, Visual Token COPY and Visual Token
ROUTE are introduced to force the model to re-attention visual information at
the visual level, addressing the limitations of text-only reflection.
Experiments on multiple visual QA datasets and hallucination metrics indicate
that Qwen-LA achieves leading accuracy performance while reducing
hallucinations. Our code is available at:

Motivation: HMER因符号布局自由和手写风格多变而具挑战性，现有方法难以整合成统一框架，而VLM的跨任务泛化能力为统一解决方案提供可能。

Method: Uni-MuMER完全微调VLM，不修改架构，结合Tree-CoT（结构化空间推理）、EDL（减少相似字符混淆）和SC（提升长表达式一致性）三种任务。

Result: 在CROHME和HME100K数据集上，Uni-MuMER超越SSAN（16.31%）和Gemini2.5-flash（24.42%），达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: Uni-MuMER展示了VLM在HMER任务中的潜力，通过数据驱动任务提升性能，为统一框架提供新思路。

Abstract: Handwritten Mathematical Expression Recognition (HMER) remains a persistent
challenge in Optical Character Recognition (OCR) due to the inherent freedom of
symbol layout and variability in handwriting styles. Prior methods have faced
performance bottlenecks, proposing isolated architectural modifications that
are difficult to integrate coherently into a unified framework. Meanwhile,
recent advances in pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated
strong cross-task generalization, offering a promising foundation for
developing unified solutions. In this paper, we introduce Uni-MuMER, which
fully fine-tunes a VLM for the HMER task without modifying its architecture,
effectively injecting domain-specific knowledge into a generalist framework.
Our method integrates three data-driven tasks: Tree-Aware Chain-of-Thought
(Tree-CoT) for structured spatial reasoning, Error-Driven Learning (EDL) for
reducing confusion among visually similar characters, and Symbol Counting (SC)
for improving recognition consistency in long expressions. Experiments on the
CROHME and HME100K datasets show that Uni-MuMER achieves new state-of-the-art
performance, surpassing the best lightweight specialized model SSAN by 16.31%
and the top-performing VLM Gemini2.5-flash by 24.42% in the zero-shot setting.

Motivation: 探索基于规则的视觉RL在多模态学习中的独特挑战和潜力，特别是在感知密集型任务中，以拼图任务为结构化实验框架。

Method: 使用拼图任务作为实验框架，通过微调MLLMs并比较RL与SFT的表现，分析模型的泛化能力和推理模式。

Result: MLLMs通过微调显著提升性能，并能泛化到复杂任务；RL比SFT更有效，但初始SFT可能阻碍RL优化；推理模式多为预存而非涌现。

Conclusion: 拼图任务为理解基于规则的视觉RL提供了重要见解，RL在多模态学习中具有潜力，但需注意初始SFT的影响。

Abstract: The application of rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) to multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) introduces unique challenges and potential deviations
from findings in text-only domains, particularly for perception-heavy tasks.
This paper provides a comprehensive study of rule-based visual RL using jigsaw
puzzles as a structured experimental framework, revealing several key findings.
\textit{Firstly,} we find that MLLMs, initially performing near to random
guessing on simple puzzles, achieve near-perfect accuracy and generalize to
complex, unseen configurations through fine-tuning. \textit{Secondly,} training
on jigsaw puzzles can induce generalization to other visual tasks, with
effectiveness tied to specific task configurations. \textit{Thirdly,} MLLMs can
learn and generalize with or without explicit reasoning, though open-source
models often favor direct answering. Consequently, even when trained for
step-by-step reasoning, they can ignore the thinking process in deriving the
final answer. \textit{Fourthly,} we observe that complex reasoning patterns
appear to be pre-existing rather than emergent, with their frequency increasing
alongside training and task difficulty. \textit{Finally,} our results
demonstrate that RL exhibits more effective generalization than Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT), and an initial SFT cold start phase can hinder subsequent RL
optimization. Although these observations are based on jigsaw puzzles and may
vary across other visual tasks, this research contributes a valuable piece of
jigsaw to the larger puzzle of collective understanding rule-based visual RL
and its potential in multimodal learning. The code is available at:

Result: 在大型CXR数据集上，DeepChest整体准确率提升7%，并显著降低任务损失。

Conclusion: DeepChest为医学诊断中的深度学习提供了更高效和稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: While Multi-Task Learning (MTL) offers inherent advantages in complex domains
such as medical imaging by enabling shared representation learning, effectively
balancing task contributions remains a significant challenge. This paper
addresses this critical issue by introducing DeepChest, a novel,
computationally efficient and effective dynamic task-weighting framework
specifically designed for multi-label chest X-ray (CXR) classification. Unlike
existing heuristic or gradient-based methods that often incur substantial
overhead, DeepChest leverages a performance-driven weighting mechanism based on
effective analysis of task-specific loss trends. Given a network architecture
(e.g., ResNet18), our model-agnostic approach adaptively adjusts task
importance without requiring gradient access, thereby significantly reducing
memory usage and achieving a threefold increase in training speed. It can be
easily applied to improve various state-of-the-art methods. Extensive
experiments on a large-scale CXR dataset demonstrate that DeepChest not only
outperforms state-of-the-art MTL methods by 7% in overall accuracy but also
yields substantial reductions in individual task losses, indicating improved
generalization and effective mitigation of negative transfer. The efficiency
and performance gains of DeepChest pave the way for more practical and robust
deployment of deep learning in critical medical diagnostic applications. The

Motivation: 树冠精确分割对森林管理等领域至关重要，但现有方法难以处理复杂背景和光谱差异。

Method: 提出PerceptiveNet，结合Log-Gabor卷积层和宽感受野骨干网络，并通过实验比较不同卷积层效果。

Result: PerceptiveNet在树冠数据集和基准数据集上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PerceptiveNet通过创新设计解决了树冠分割的复杂性问题，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: The accurate semantic segmentation of tree crowns within remotely sensed data
is crucial for scientific endeavours such as forest management, biodiversity
studies, and carbon sequestration quantification. However, precise segmentation
remains challenging due to complexities in the forest canopy, including
shadows, intricate backgrounds, scale variations, and subtle spectral
differences among tree species. Compared to the traditional methods, Deep
Learning models improve accuracy by extracting informative and discriminative
features, but often fall short in capturing the aforementioned complexities.
  To address these challenges, we propose PerceptiveNet, a novel model
incorporating a Logarithmic Gabor-parameterised convolutional layer with
trainable filter parameters, alongside a backbone that extracts salient
features while capturing extensive context and spatial information through a
wider receptive field. We investigate the impact of Log-Gabor, Gabor, and
standard convolutional layers on semantic segmentation performance through
extensive experimentation. Additionally, we conduct an ablation study to assess
the contributions of individual layers and their combinations to overall model
performance, and we evaluate PerceptiveNet as a backbone within a novel hybrid
CNN-Transformer model. Our results outperform state-of-the-art models,
demonstrating significant performance improvements on a tree crown dataset
while generalising across domains, including two benchmark aerial scene
semantic segmentation datasets with varying complexities.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试覆盖范围有限，无法反映真实内窥镜场景的多样性和临床工作流程的需求。

Method: 引入EndoBench，包含4种内窥镜场景、12项临床任务和5级视觉提示粒度，共6,832个验证问题。

Result: 实验显示专有MLLMs表现优于开源模型但仍不及人类专家；医学领域微调显著提升性能；模型对提示格式和任务复杂度敏感。

Conclusion: EndoBench为内窥镜领域MLLMs的评估和进步设定了新标准，并公开了基准和代码。

Abstract: Endoscopic procedures are essential for diagnosing and treating internal
diseases, and multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly
applied to assist in endoscopy analysis. However, current benchmarks are
limited, as they typically cover specific endoscopic scenarios and a small set
of clinical tasks, failing to capture the real-world diversity of endoscopic
scenarios and the full range of skills needed in clinical workflows. To address
these issues, we introduce EndoBench, the first comprehensive benchmark
specifically designed to assess MLLMs across the full spectrum of endoscopic
practice with multi-dimensional capacities. EndoBench encompasses 4 distinct
endoscopic scenarios, 12 specialized clinical tasks with 12 secondary subtasks,
and 5 levels of visual prompting granularities, resulting in 6,832 rigorously
validated VQA pairs from 21 diverse datasets. Our multi-dimensional evaluation
framework mirrors the clinical workflow--spanning anatomical recognition,
lesion analysis, spatial localization, and surgical operations--to holistically
gauge the perceptual and diagnostic abilities of MLLMs in realistic scenarios.
We benchmark 23 state-of-the-art models, including general-purpose,
medical-specialized, and proprietary MLLMs, and establish human clinician
performance as a reference standard. Our extensive experiments reveal: (1)
proprietary MLLMs outperform open-source and medical-specialized models
overall, but still trail human experts; (2) medical-domain supervised
fine-tuning substantially boosts task-specific accuracy; and (3) model
performance remains sensitive to prompt format and clinical task complexity.
EndoBench establishes a new standard for evaluating and advancing MLLMs in
endoscopy, highlighting both progress and persistent gaps between current
models and expert clinical reasoning. We publicly release our benchmark and
code.

Result: 特征拼接方法保留了更多细节拓扑信息，分类性能更好。

Conclusion: 在类似实验中，推荐使用特征拼接方法构建拓扑特征向量。

Abstract: In medical image analysis, feature engineering plays an important role in the
design and performance of machine learning models. Persistent homology (PH),
from the field of topological data analysis (TDA), demonstrates robustness and
stability to data perturbations and addresses the limitation from traditional
feature extraction approaches where a small change in input results in a large
change in feature representation. Using PH, we store persistent topological and
geometrical features in the form of the persistence barcode whereby large bars
represent global topological features and small bars encapsulate geometrical
information of the data. When multiple barcodes are computed from 2D or 3D
medical images, two approaches can be used to construct the final topological
feature vector in each dimension: aggregating persistence barcodes followed by
featurization or concatenating topological feature vectors derived from each
barcode. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive analysis across diverse
medical imaging datasets to compare the effects of the two aforementioned
approaches on the performance of classification models. The results of this
analysis indicate that feature concatenation preserves detailed topological
information from individual barcodes, yields better classification performance
and is therefore a preferred approach when conducting similar experiments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于三角形的推理时优化框架，用于表示场景的几何和外观，相比高斯样点，三角形能提供更丰富的颜色插值并支持下游任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前广泛使用的高斯样点在颜色插值和表面连续性方面存在不足，三角形作为一种更灵活的表示方法，能更好地支持场景优化。

Method: 开发了一种针对三角形汤（不连接的半透明三角形集合）的场景优化算法，通过引入连接力在优化过程中鼓励表面连续性。

Result: 在代表性3D重建数据集上实验，展示了在光度和几何结果上的竞争力。

Conclusion: 三角形作为一种表示方法，在场景优化中具有潜力，尤其是在颜色插值和表面连续性方面优于高斯样点。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce an inference-time optimization framework utilizing
triangles to represent the geometry and appearance of the scene. More
specifically, we develop a scene optimization algorithm for triangle soup, a
collection of disconnected semi-transparent triangle primitives. Compared to
the current most-widely used primitives for 3D scene representation, namely
Gaussian splats, triangles allow for more expressive color interpolation, and
benefit from a large algorithmic infrastructure for downstream tasks.
Triangles, unlike full-rank Gaussian kernels, naturally combine to form
surfaces. We formulate connectivity forces between triangles during
optimization, encouraging explicit, but soft, surface continuity in 3D. We
perform experiments on a representative 3D reconstruction dataset and show
competitive photometric and geometric results.

TL;DR: 论文提出VideoREPA框架，通过Token Relation Distillation损失将物理知识注入T2V模型，显著提升生成视频的物理合理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前T2V模型在生成物理合理内容方面表现不足，VideoREPA旨在通过视频理解基础模型的知识蒸馏填补这一差距。

Method: 提出Token Relation Distillation (TRD)损失，利用时空对齐对预训练T2V模型进行微调，注入物理知识。

Result: VideoREPA显著提升了基线模型CogVideoX的物理常识表现，在相关基准测试中取得显著改进。

Conclusion: VideoREPA是首个针对T2V模型微调和物理知识注入的REPA方法，有效提升了生成视频的物理一致性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models have enabled
high-fidelity and realistic video synthesis. However, current T2V models often
struggle to generate physically plausible content due to their limited inherent
ability to accurately understand physics. We found that while the
representations within T2V models possess some capacity for physics
understanding, they lag significantly behind those from recent video
self-supervised learning methods. To this end, we propose a novel framework
called VideoREPA, which distills physics understanding capability from video
understanding foundation models into T2V models by aligning token-level
relations. This closes the physics understanding gap and enable more
physics-plausible generation. Specifically, we introduce the Token Relation
Distillation (TRD) loss, leveraging spatio-temporal alignment to provide soft
guidance suitable for finetuning powerful pre-trained T2V models, a critical
departure from prior representation alignment (REPA) methods. To our knowledge,
VideoREPA is the first REPA method designed for finetuning T2V models and
specifically for injecting physical knowledge. Empirical evaluations show that
VideoREPA substantially enhances the physics commonsense of baseline method,
CogVideoX, achieving significant improvement on relevant benchmarks and
demonstrating a strong capacity for generating videos consistent with intuitive
physics. More video results are available at https://videorepa.github.io/.

Motivation: 探索一种新的视觉合成方法，利用自回归模型统一图像扩散过程，简化设计并提升性能。

Method: 设计令牌化器将图像转换为离散令牌序列，利用扩散特性实现粗到细的自回归建模，使用标准的下一个令牌预测方法。

Result: 在ImageNet基准测试中，使用775M Llama主干和256个离散令牌，FID达到2.09。

Conclusion: D-AR展示了自回归架构在视觉合成中的潜力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: This paper presents Diffusion via Autoregressive models (D-AR), a new
paradigm recasting the image diffusion process as a vanilla autoregressive
procedure in the standard next-token-prediction fashion. We start by designing
the tokenizer that converts images into sequences of discrete tokens, where
tokens in different positions can be decoded into different diffusion denoising
steps in the pixel space. Thanks to the diffusion properties, these tokens
naturally follow a coarse-to-fine order, which directly lends itself to
autoregressive modeling. Therefore, we apply standard next-token prediction on
these tokens, without modifying any underlying designs (either causal masks or
training/inference strategies), and such sequential autoregressive token
generation directly mirrors the diffusion procedure in image space. That is,
once the autoregressive model generates an increment of tokens, we can directly
decode these tokens into the corresponding diffusion denoising step in the
streaming manner. Our pipeline naturally reveals several intriguing properties,
for example, it supports consistent previews when generating only a subset of
tokens and enables zero-shot layout-controlled synthesis. On the standard
ImageNet benchmark, our method achieves 2.09 FID using a 775M Llama backbone
with 256 discrete tokens. We hope our work can inspire future research on
unified autoregressive architectures of visual synthesis, especially with large
language models. Code and models will be available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViGoRL是一种通过强化学习在视觉推理任务中显式锚定视觉坐标的视觉语言模型，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉推理任务需要模型具备视觉注意力、感知输入解释和空间证据抽象推理能力，传统方法缺乏显式锚定机制。

Method: ViGoRL通过多轮强化学习框架动态聚焦视觉坐标，生成空间锚定的推理轨迹。

Result: 在多个视觉推理基准测试中表现优异，如V*Bench达到86.4%，且人类评估显示其视觉参考准确且易于理解。

Conclusion: 视觉锚定的强化学习是提升通用视觉推理能力的有效范式。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) over chains of thought has significantly
advanced language models in tasks such as mathematics and coding, visual
reasoning introduces added complexity by requiring models to direct visual
attention, interpret perceptual inputs, and ground abstract reasoning in
spatial evidence. We introduce ViGoRL (Visually Grounded Reinforcement
Learning), a vision-language model trained with RL to explicitly anchor each
reasoning step to specific visual coordinates. Inspired by human visual
decision-making, ViGoRL learns to produce spatially grounded reasoning traces,
guiding visual attention to task-relevant regions at each step. When
fine-grained exploration is required, our novel multi-turn RL framework enables
the model to dynamically zoom into predicted coordinates as reasoning unfolds.
Across a diverse set of visual reasoning benchmarks--including SAT-2 and BLINK
for spatial reasoning, V*bench for visual search, and ScreenSpot and
VisualWebArena for web-based grounding--ViGoRL consistently outperforms both
supervised fine-tuning and conventional RL baselines that lack explicit
grounding mechanisms. Incorporating multi-turn RL with zoomed-in visual
feedback significantly improves ViGoRL's performance on localizing small GUI
elements and visual search, achieving 86.4% on V*Bench. Additionally, we find
that grounding amplifies other visual behaviors such as region exploration,
grounded subgoal setting, and visual verification. Finally, human evaluations
show that the model's visual references are not only spatially accurate but
also helpful for understanding model reasoning steps. Our results show that
visually grounded RL is a strong paradigm for imbuing models with
general-purpose visual reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个名为VF-Eval的新基准，用于全面评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在AI生成内容（AIGC）视频上的能力，发现现有模型表现不佳，并通过实验RePrompt展示了其实际应用价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注自然视频，而忽略了合成视频（如AIGC）的评估，同时MLLMs在AIGC视频解释能力上的研究不足。

Method: 提出VF-Eval基准，包含四项任务（连贯性验证、错误意识、错误类型检测和推理评估），并评估了13种前沿MLLMs。

Result: 即使是表现最佳的GPT-4.1模型，在所有任务中均未能取得一致优异表现，表明基准的挑战性。

Conclusion: VF-Eval揭示了MLLMs在AIGC视频上的局限性，并通过RePrompt实验展示了其在改进视频生成中的潜在应用。

Abstract: MLLMs have been widely studied for video question answering recently.
However, most existing assessments focus on natural videos, overlooking
synthetic videos, such as AI-generated content (AIGC). Meanwhile, some works in
video generation rely on MLLMs to evaluate the quality of generated videos, but
the capabilities of MLLMs on interpreting AIGC videos remain largely
underexplored. To address this, we propose a new benchmark, VF-Eval, which
introduces four tasks-coherence validation, error awareness, error type
detection, and reasoning evaluation-to comprehensively evaluate the abilities
of MLLMs on AIGC videos. We evaluate 13 frontier MLLMs on VF-Eval and find that
even the best-performing model, GPT-4.1, struggles to achieve consistently good
performance across all tasks. This highlights the challenging nature of our
benchmark. Additionally, to investigate the practical applications of VF-Eval
in improving video generation, we conduct an experiment, RePrompt,
demonstrating that aligning MLLMs more closely with human feedback can benefit
video generation.

Result: 在识别和分割任务中，DA-VPT显著提升了ViT模型的微调效果和效率。

Conclusion: DA-VPT通过语义信息引导提示学习，为下游视觉任务提供了更高效的微调方法。

Abstract: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) has become a promising solution for
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) approach for Vision Transformer (ViT)
models by partially fine-tuning learnable tokens while keeping most model
parameters frozen. Recent research has explored modifying the connection
structures of the prompts. However, the fundamental correlation and
distribution between the prompts and image tokens remain unexplored. In this
paper, we leverage metric learning techniques to investigate how the
distribution of prompts affects fine-tuning performance. Specifically, we
propose a novel framework, Distribution Aware Visual Prompt Tuning (DA-VPT), to
guide the distributions of the prompts by learning the distance metric from
their class-related semantic data. Our method demonstrates that the prompts can
serve as an effective bridge to share semantic information between image
patches and the class token. We extensively evaluated our approach on popular
benchmarks in both recognition and segmentation tasks. The results demonstrate
that our approach enables more effective and efficient fine-tuning of ViT
models by leveraging semantic information to guide the learning of the prompts,
leading to improved performance on various downstream vision tasks.

TL;DR: CLDTracker提出了一种基于全面语言描述的视觉跟踪框架，通过双分支架构（文本和视觉分支）解决VOT任务中的动态外观变化和背景干扰问题，实现了SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统跟踪器在复杂场景中表现不佳，而VLM的语义理解能力为VOT提供了潜力，但直接应用存在文本表示不足、特征融合效率低和缺乏时间建模的问题。

Method: 采用双分支架构，文本分支利用CLIP和GPT-4V生成丰富的文本描述，视觉分支结合视觉特征，优化视觉与文本特征的融合。

Result: 在六个标准VOT基准测试中，CLDTracker实现了SOTA性能。

Conclusion: CLDTracker通过结合强大的VLM和时间自适应视觉-语言表示，显著提升了VOT任务的性能。

Abstract: VOT remains a fundamental yet challenging task in computer vision due to
dynamic appearance changes, occlusions, and background clutter. Traditional
trackers, relying primarily on visual cues, often struggle in such complex
scenarios. Recent advancements in VLMs have shown promise in semantic
understanding for tasks like open-vocabulary detection and image captioning,
suggesting their potential for VOT. However, the direct application of VLMs to
VOT is hindered by critical limitations: the absence of a rich and
comprehensive textual representation that semantically captures the target
object's nuances, limiting the effective use of language information;
inefficient fusion mechanisms that fail to optimally integrate visual and
textual features, preventing a holistic understanding of the target; and a lack
of temporal modeling of the target's evolving appearance in the language
domain, leading to a disconnect between the initial description and the
object's subsequent visual changes. To bridge these gaps and unlock the full
potential of VLMs for VOT, we propose CLDTracker, a novel Comprehensive
Language Description framework for robust visual Tracking. Our tracker
introduces a dual-branch architecture consisting of a textual and a visual
branch. In the textual branch, we construct a rich bag of textual descriptions
derived by harnessing the powerful VLMs such as CLIP and GPT-4V, enriched with
semantic and contextual cues to address the lack of rich textual
representation. Experiments on six standard VOT benchmarks demonstrate that
CLDTracker achieves SOTA performance, validating the effectiveness of
leveraging robust and temporally-adaptive vision-language representations for
tracking. Code and models are publicly available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于图像条件差异大且缺乏临床背景，仅基于图像的黑色素瘤检测和皮肤病变分类面临挑战。医生通常结合患者病史和其他病变信息进行综合评估，SLIMP受此启发，整合了图像和元数据。

Method: SLIMP采用嵌套对比学习方法，结合单个皮肤病变的外观、元数据以及患者级别的医疗记录和其他临床相关信息。

Conclusion: SLIMP通过充分利用所有可用数据模态，显著提升了皮肤病变分类的性能，为临床诊断提供了更可靠的辅助工具。

Abstract: We introduce SLIMP (Skin Lesion Image-Metadata Pre-training) for learning
rich representations of skin lesions through a novel nested contrastive
learning approach that captures complex relationships between images and
metadata. Melanoma detection and skin lesion classification based solely on
images, pose significant challenges due to large variations in imaging
conditions (lighting, color, resolution, distance, etc.) and lack of clinical
and phenotypical context. Clinicians typically follow a holistic approach for
assessing the risk level of the patient and for deciding which lesions may be
malignant and need to be excised, by considering the patient's medical history
as well as the appearance of other lesions of the patient. Inspired by this,
SLIMP combines the appearance and the metadata of individual skin lesions with
patient-level metadata relating to their medical record and other clinically
relevant information. By fully exploiting all available data modalities
throughout the learning process, the proposed pre-training strategy improves
performance compared to other pre-training strategies on downstream skin
lesions classification tasks highlighting the learned representations quality.

Motivation: 传统神经渲染方法需要已知相机姿态和逐场景优化，而现有前馈方法在密集视图下计算负担重，AnySplat旨在解决这些问题。

Conclusion: AnySplat为无约束捕获环境下的实时新视角合成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce AnySplat, a feed forward network for novel view synthesis from
uncalibrated image collections. In contrast to traditional neural rendering
pipelines that demand known camera poses and per scene optimization, or recent
feed forward methods that buckle under the computational weight of dense views,
our model predicts everything in one shot. A single forward pass yields a set
of 3D Gaussian primitives encoding both scene geometry and appearance, and the
corresponding camera intrinsics and extrinsics for each input image. This
unified design scales effortlessly to casually captured, multi view datasets
without any pose annotations. In extensive zero shot evaluations, AnySplat
matches the quality of pose aware baselines in both sparse and dense view
scenarios while surpassing existing pose free approaches. Moreover, it greatly
reduce rendering latency compared to optimization based neural fields, bringing
real time novel view synthesis within reach for unconstrained capture
settings.Project page: https://city-super.github.io/anysplat/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标检测任务中标注边界的主观性导致数据质量不一致，噪声标注会显著降低模型性能，尤其是在少样本场景下。

Method: 结合多实例学习（MIL）框架和预处理流程，利用基础模型修正标签，并对检测头进行轻微调整。

Result: 在多个数据集上实现了最先进的性能，适用于标准和少样本场景，且方法更简单高效。

Conclusion: FMG-Det通过标签修正和框架优化，有效解决了噪声标注对目标检测模型的影响。

Abstract: Collecting high quality data for object detection tasks is challenging due to
the inherent subjectivity in labeling the boundaries of an object. This makes
it difficult to not only collect consistent annotations across a dataset but
also to validate them, as no two annotators are likely to label the same object
using the exact same coordinates. These challenges are further compounded when
object boundaries are partially visible or blurred, which can be the case in
many domains. Training on noisy annotations significantly degrades detector
performance, rendering them unusable, particularly in few-shot settings, where
just a few corrupted annotations can impact model performance. In this work, we
propose FMG-Det, a simple, efficient methodology for training models with noisy
annotations. More specifically, we propose combining a multiple instance
learning (MIL) framework with a pre-processing pipeline that leverages powerful
foundation models to correct labels prior to training. This pre-processing
pipeline, along with slight modifications to the detector head, results in
state-of-the-art performance across a number of datasets, for both standard and
few-shot scenarios, while being much simpler and more efficient than other
approaches.

Result: 实验表明，该方法提高了推理效率和分割性能。

Conclusion: 为高效可解释的多模态理解提供了新思路。

Abstract: Existing reasoning segmentation approaches typically fine-tune multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) using image-text pairs and corresponding mask
labels. However, they exhibit limited generalization to out-of-distribution
scenarios without an explicit reasoning process. Although recent efforts
leverage reinforcement learning through group-relative policy optimization
(GRPO) to enhance reasoning ability, they often suffer from overthinking -
producing uniformly verbose reasoning chains irrespective of task complexity.
This results in elevated computational costs and limited control over reasoning
quality. To address this problem, we propose PixelThink, a simple yet effective
scheme that integrates externally estimated task difficulty and internally
measured model uncertainty to regulate reasoning generation within a
reinforcement learning paradigm. The model learns to compress reasoning length
in accordance with scene complexity and predictive confidence. To support
comprehensive evaluation, we introduce ReasonSeg-Diff, an extended benchmark
with annotated reasoning references and difficulty scores, along with a suite
of metrics designed to assess segmentation accuracy, reasoning quality, and
efficiency jointly. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach
improves both reasoning efficiency and overall segmentation performance. Our
work contributes novel perspectives towards efficient and interpretable
multimodal understanding. The code and model will be publicly available.

Result: 在80GB GPU上支持超过100个480P分辨率输入视图，并在DL3DV-10K和RealEstate10K基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: ZPressor显著提升了前馈3DGS模型的扩展性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models have recently emerged as a
promising solution for novel view synthesis, enabling one-pass inference
without the need for per-scene 3DGS optimization. However, their scalability is
fundamentally constrained by the limited capacity of their encoders, leading to
degraded performance or excessive memory consumption as the number of input
views increases. In this work, we analyze feed-forward 3DGS frameworks through
the lens of the Information Bottleneck principle and introduce ZPressor, a
lightweight architecture-agnostic module that enables efficient compression of
multi-view inputs into a compact latent state $Z$ that retains essential scene
information while discarding redundancy. Concretely, ZPressor enables existing
feed-forward 3DGS models to scale to over 100 input views at 480P resolution on
an 80GB GPU, by partitioning the views into anchor and support sets and using
cross attention to compress the information from the support views into anchor
views, forming the compressed latent state $Z$. We show that integrating
ZPressor into several state-of-the-art feed-forward 3DGS models consistently
improves performance under moderate input views and enhances robustness under
dense view settings on two large-scale benchmarks DL3DV-10K and RealEstate10K.

Conclusion: MAGREF为可扩展、可控且高保真的多主题视频合成提供了新方向。

Abstract: Video generation has made substantial strides with the emergence of deep
generative models, especially diffusion-based approaches. However, video
generation based on multiple reference subjects still faces significant
challenges in maintaining multi-subject consistency and ensuring high
generation quality. In this paper, we propose MAGREF, a unified framework for
any-reference video generation that introduces masked guidance to enable
coherent multi-subject video synthesis conditioned on diverse reference images
and a textual prompt. Specifically, we propose (1) a region-aware dynamic
masking mechanism that enables a single model to flexibly handle various
subject inference, including humans, objects, and backgrounds, without
architectural changes, and (2) a pixel-wise channel concatenation mechanism
that operates on the channel dimension to better preserve appearance features.
Our model delivers state-of-the-art video generation quality, generalizing from
single-subject training to complex multi-subject scenarios with coherent
synthesis and precise control over individual subjects, outperforming existing
open-source and commercial baselines. To facilitate evaluation, we also
introduce a comprehensive multi-subject video benchmark. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, paving the way for scalable,
controllable, and high-fidelity multi-subject video synthesis. Code and model

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在极端低光条件下，传统ISP算法和现有回归模型难以恢复清晰细节和准确颜色，需要更智能的解决方案。

Method: 利用预训练的生成扩散模型，结合相机ISP任务，增强低光原始图像。

Result: 在三个低光原始图像基准测试中，该方法在感知质量上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该框架通过重新利用预训练扩散模型，显著提升了低光图像增强的效果。

Abstract: High-quality photography in extreme low-light conditions is challenging but
impactful for digital cameras. With advanced computing hardware, traditional
camera image signal processor (ISP) algorithms are gradually being replaced by
efficient deep networks that enhance noisy raw images more intelligently.
However, existing regression-based models often minimize pixel errors and
result in oversmoothing of low-light photos or deep shadows. Recent work has
attempted to address this limitation by training a diffusion model from
scratch, yet those models still struggle to recover sharp image details and
accurate colors. We introduce a novel framework to enhance low-light raw images
by retasking pre-trained generative diffusion models with the camera ISP.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art in perceptual quality across three challenging low-light raw
image benchmarks.

TL;DR: SOYO是一个轻量级框架，通过高斯混合压缩器和域特征重采样器改进PIDIL中的域选择，在多任务中表现优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有PIDIL方法在域和类别增加时参数选择准确性不足的问题。

Method: 引入高斯混合压缩器（GMC）和域特征重采样器（DFR）存储和平衡数据，结合多级域特征融合网络（MDFN）增强特征提取。

Result: 在六个基准测试中表现优于现有方法，展示了鲁棒性和适应性。

Conclusion: SOYO在动态环境中具有显著优势，代码将开源。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) often underperform in real-world, dynamic
settings where data distributions change over time. Domain Incremental Learning
(DIL) offers a solution by enabling continual model adaptation, with
Parameter-Isolation DIL (PIDIL) emerging as a promising paradigm to reduce
knowledge conflicts. However, existing PIDIL methods struggle with parameter
selection accuracy, especially as the number of domains and corresponding
classes grows. To address this, we propose SOYO, a lightweight framework that
improves domain selection in PIDIL. SOYO introduces a Gaussian Mixture
Compressor (GMC) and Domain Feature Resampler (DFR) to store and balance prior
domain data efficiently, while a Multi-level Domain Feature Fusion Network
(MDFN) enhances domain feature extraction. Our framework supports multiple
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods and is validated across tasks
such as image classification, object detection, and speech enhancement.
Experimental results on six benchmarks demonstrate SOYO's consistent
superiority over existing baselines, showcasing its robustness and adaptability
in complex, evolving environments. The codes will be released in

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TrustVLM是一个无需训练的框架，旨在提高视觉语言模型（VLM）预测的可信度，通过利用图像嵌入空间改进误分类检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLM在零样本和迁移学习中表现优异，但在安全关键领域容易产生自信但错误的预测，存在严重风险。

Method: 提出一种基于图像嵌入空间的置信度评分函数，利用模态间隙和概念在嵌入空间中的区分度。

Result: 在17个数据集上验证，性能显著提升（AURC提高51.87%，AUROC提高9.14%，FPR95降低32.42%）。

Conclusion: TrustVLM无需重新训练即可提升VLM的可靠性，为实际应用中的安全部署铺平道路。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
aligning visual and textual modalities, enabling a wide range of applications
in multimodal understanding and generation. While they excel in zero-shot and
transfer learning scenarios, VLMs remain susceptible to misclassification,
often yielding confident yet incorrect predictions. This limitation poses a
significant risk in safety-critical domains, where erroneous predictions can
lead to severe consequences. In this work, we introduce TrustVLM, a
training-free framework designed to address the critical challenge of
estimating when VLM's predictions can be trusted. Motivated by the observed
modality gap in VLMs and the insight that certain concepts are more distinctly
represented in the image embedding space, we propose a novel confidence-scoring
function that leverages this space to improve misclassification detection. We
rigorously evaluate our approach across 17 diverse datasets, employing 4
architectures and 2 VLMs, and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with
improvements of up to 51.87% in AURC, 9.14% in AUROC, and 32.42% in FPR95
compared to existing baselines. By improving the reliability of the model
without requiring retraining, TrustVLM paves the way for safer deployment of
VLMs in real-world applications. The code will be available at

TL;DR: Spatial-MLLM是一个新颖的框架，通过纯2D输入实现视觉空间推理，无需依赖额外的3D或2.5D数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）依赖额外3D或2.5D数据，限制了其在仅有2D输入（如图像或视频）场景中的应用。

Method: 提出双编码器架构：一个预训练的2D视觉编码器提取语义特征，另一个空间编码器（基于视觉几何模型）提取3D结构特征，并通过连接器整合。还提出空间感知帧采样策略。

Result: 在多个真实世界数据集上，Spatial-MLLM在视觉空间理解和推理任务中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: Spatial-MLLM通过纯2D输入实现了高效的视觉空间推理，扩展了MLLMs的应用场景。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
significantly enhanced performance on 2D visual tasks. However, improving their
spatial intelligence remains a challenge. Existing 3D MLLMs always rely on
additional 3D or 2.5D data to incorporate spatial awareness, restricting their
utility in scenarios with only 2D inputs, such as images or videos. In this
paper, we present Spatial-MLLM, a novel framework for visual-based spatial
reasoning from purely 2D observations. Unlike conventional video MLLMs which
rely on CLIP-based visual encoders optimized for semantic understanding, our
key insight is to unleash the strong structure prior from the feed-forward
visual geometry foundation model. Specifically, we propose a dual-encoder
architecture: a pretrained 2D visual encoder to extract semantic features, and
a spatial encoder-initialized from the backbone of the visual geometry model-to
extract 3D structure features. A connector then integrates both features into
unified visual tokens for enhanced spatial understanding. Furthermore, we
propose a space-aware frame sampling strategy at inference time, which selects
the spatially informative frames of a video sequence, ensuring that even under
limited token length, the model focuses on frames critical for spatial
reasoning. Beyond architecture improvements, we construct the Spatial-MLLM-120k
dataset and train the model on it using supervised fine-tuning and GRPO.
Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate that our
spatial-MLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance in a wide range of
visual-based spatial understanding and reasoning tasks. Project page:

TL;DR: ThinkGeo是一个用于评估LLM驱动代理在遥感任务中工具使用和多步规划能力的基准测试，填补了领域特定评估的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估多关注通用或多模态场景，缺乏针对复杂遥感用例的工具使用能力评估。

Method: ThinkGeo包含人类策划的查询，覆盖多种实际应用，采用ReAct式交互循环评估开源和闭源LLM。

Result: 评估揭示了不同模型在工具准确性和规划一致性上的显著差异。

Conclusion: ThinkGeo为评估工具增强LLM在遥感中的空间推理能力提供了首个广泛测试平台。

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has enabled tool-augmented
agents capable of solving complex real-world tasks through step-by-step
reasoning. However, existing evaluations often focus on general-purpose or
multimodal scenarios, leaving a gap in domain-specific benchmarks that assess
tool-use capabilities in complex remote sensing use cases. We present ThinkGeo,
an agentic benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-driven agents on remote sensing
tasks via structured tool use and multi-step planning. Inspired by
tool-interaction paradigms, ThinkGeo includes human-curated queries spanning a
wide range of real-world applications such as urban planning, disaster
assessment and change analysis, environmental monitoring, transportation
analysis, aviation monitoring, recreational infrastructure, and industrial site
analysis. Each query is grounded in satellite or aerial imagery and requires
agents to reason through a diverse toolset. We implement a ReAct-style
interaction loop and evaluate both open and closed-source LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o,
Qwen2.5) on 436 structured agentic tasks. The benchmark reports both step-wise
execution metrics and final answer correctness. Our analysis reveals notable
disparities in tool accuracy and planning consistency across models. ThinkGeo
provides the first extensive testbed for evaluating how tool-enabled LLMs
handle spatial reasoning in remote sensing. Our code and dataset are publicly
available

*Justin Lazarow,Kai Kang,Afshin Dehghan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于物体中心的场景级3D目标检测方法Rooms from Motion (RfM)，通过3D定向框作为几何基元，实现定位与建图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D目标检测方法依赖全局操作和已知相机位姿，RfM旨在解决无位姿图像集合的3D目标检测问题。

Method: 用基于图像3D框的物体中心匹配器替代传统2D关键点匹配器，估计相机位姿和物体轨迹，生成全局语义3D物体地图。

Result: RfM在CA-1M和ScanNet++上表现优于基于点和多视图的3D目标检测方法，地图质量更高。

Conclusion: RfM提供了一种通用的物体中心表示，扩展了Cubify Anything的能力，支持稀疏定位和参数化建图。

Abstract: We revisit scene-level 3D object detection as the output of an object-centric
framework capable of both localization and mapping using 3D oriented boxes as
the underlying geometric primitive. While existing 3D object detection
approaches operate globally and implicitly rely on the a priori existence of
metric camera poses, our method, Rooms from Motion (RfM) operates on a
collection of un-posed images. By replacing the standard 2D keypoint-based
matcher of structure-from-motion with an object-centric matcher based on
image-derived 3D boxes, we estimate metric camera poses, object tracks, and
finally produce a global, semantic 3D object map. When a priori pose is
available, we can significantly improve map quality through optimization of
global 3D boxes against individual observations. RfM shows strong localization
performance and subsequently produces maps of higher quality than leading
point-based and multi-view 3D object detection methods on CA-1M and ScanNet++,
despite these global methods relying on overparameterization through point
clouds or dense volumes. Rooms from Motion achieves a general, object-centric
representation which not only extends the work of Cubify Anything to full
scenes but also allows for inherently sparse localization and parametric
mapping proportional to the number of objects in a scene.

Result: 实验表明，使用该数据集训练的VLA模型在多个基准测试中表现显著提升，包括闭环NeuroNCAP分数、碰撞率和开环nuScenes轨迹预测。

Conclusion: Impromptu VLA数据集有效提升了VLA模型的性能，并为感知、预测和规划提供了诊断工具。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for autonomous driving show promise but
falter in unstructured corner case scenarios, largely due to a scarcity of
targeted benchmarks. To address this, we introduce Impromptu VLA. Our core
contribution is the Impromptu VLA Dataset: over 80,000 meticulously curated
video clips, distilled from over 2M source clips sourced from 8 open-source
large-scale datasets. This dataset is built upon our novel taxonomy of four
challenging unstructured categories and features rich, planning-oriented
question-answering annotations and action trajectories. Crucially, experiments
demonstrate that VLAs trained with our dataset achieve substantial performance
gains on established benchmarks--improving closed-loop NeuroNCAP scores and
collision rates, and reaching near state-of-the-art L2 accuracy in open-loop
nuScenes trajectory prediction. Furthermore, our Q&A suite serves as an
effective diagnostic, revealing clear VLM improvements in perception,
prediction, and planning. Our code, data and models are available at

TL;DR: LoRAShop是一个多概念图像编辑框架，利用LoRA模型实现个性化编辑，无需重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多概念图像编辑中身份保留和全局上下文一致性的问题。

Method: 通过观察扩散变换器中的特征交互模式，生成解耦的潜在掩码，并在特定区域混合LoRA权重。

Result: 实验表明，LoRAShop在身份保留方面优于基线方法。

Conclusion: LoRAShop为视觉创作和快速迭代提供了实用工具。

Abstract: We introduce LoRAShop, the first framework for multi-concept image editing
with LoRA models. LoRAShop builds on a key observation about the feature
interaction patterns inside Flux-style diffusion transformers: concept-specific
transformer features activate spatially coherent regions early in the denoising
process. We harness this observation to derive a disentangled latent mask for
each concept in a prior forward pass and blend the corresponding LoRA weights
only within regions bounding the concepts to be personalized. The resulting
edits seamlessly integrate multiple subjects or styles into the original scene
while preserving global context, lighting, and fine details. Our experiments
demonstrate that LoRAShop delivers better identity preservation compared to
baselines. By eliminating retraining and external constraints, LoRAShop turns
personalized diffusion models into a practical `photoshop-with-LoRAs' tool and
opens new avenues for compositional visual storytelling and rapid creative
iteration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高效轻量级模型适用于照片但不适用于草图，缺乏针对草图数据的高效推理研究。

Method: 1. 跨模态知识蒸馏网络将照片高效网络适配草图；2. RL画布选择器动态调整草图抽象级别。

Result: FLOPs减少99.37%（40.18G到0.254G），精度几乎不变（33.03% vs 32.77%）。

Conclusion: 提出的方法首次实现了针对草图数据的高效网络，计算量甚至低于最佳照片模型。

Abstract: As sketch research has collectively matured over time, its adaptation for
at-mass commercialisation emerges on the immediate horizon. Despite an already
mature research endeavour for photos, there is no research on the efficient
inference specifically designed for sketch data. In this paper, we first
demonstrate existing state-of-the-art efficient light-weight models designed
for photos do not work on sketches. We then propose two sketch-specific
components which work in a plug-n-play manner on any photo efficient network to
adapt them to work on sketch data. We specifically chose fine-grained
sketch-based image retrieval (FG-SBIR) as a demonstrator as the most recognised
sketch problem with immediate commercial value. Technically speaking, we first
propose a cross-modal knowledge distillation network to transfer existing photo
efficient networks to be compatible with sketch, which brings down number of
FLOPs and model parameters by 97.96% percent and 84.89% respectively. We then
exploit the abstract trait of sketch to introduce a RL-based canvas selector
that dynamically adjusts to the abstraction level which further cuts down
number of FLOPs by two thirds. The end result is an overall reduction of 99.37%
of FLOPs (from 40.18G to 0.254G) when compared with a full network, while
retaining the accuracy (33.03% vs 32.77%) -- finally making an efficient
network for the sparse sketch data that exhibit even fewer FLOPs than the best
photo counterpart.

Result: 开源模型最高准确率约30%，OpenAI模型达40%，而人类为97%。

Conclusion: MMSI-Bench揭示了多图像空间智能的挑战性，并提供了错误分析框架，为未来研究指明方向。

Abstract: Spatial intelligence is essential for multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) operating in the complex physical world. Existing benchmarks, however,
probe only single-image relations and thus fail to assess the multi-image
spatial reasoning that real-world deployments demand. We introduce MMSI-Bench,
a VQA benchmark dedicated to multi-image spatial intelligence. Six 3D-vision
researchers spent more than 300 hours meticulously crafting 1,000 challenging,
unambiguous multiple-choice questions from over 120,000 images, each paired
with carefully designed distractors and a step-by-step reasoning process. We
conduct extensive experiments and thoroughly evaluate 34 open-source and
proprietary MLLMs, observing a wide gap: the strongest open-source model
attains roughly 30% accuracy and OpenAI's o3 reasoning model reaches 40%, while
humans score 97%. These results underscore the challenging nature of MMSI-Bench
and the substantial headroom for future research. Leveraging the annotated
reasoning processes, we also provide an automated error analysis pipeline that
diagnoses four dominant failure modes, including (1) grounding errors, (2)
overlap-matching and scene-reconstruction errors, (3) situation-transformation
reasoning errors, and (4) spatial-logic errors, offering valuable insights for

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated

Evaluations on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that Argus excels in both
multimodal reasoning tasks and referring object grounding tasks. Extensive
analysis further validates various design choices of Argus, and reveals the

Abstract: This study explores the use of text-prompted MRI image generation with the
Stable Diffusion (SD) model to address challenges in acquiring real MRI
datasets, such as high costs, limited rare case samples, and privacy concerns.
The SD model, pre-trained on natural images, was fine-tuned using the 3T
fastMRI dataset and the 0.3T M4Raw dataset, with the goal of generating brain
T1, T2, and FLAIR images across different magnetic field strengths. The
performance of the fine-tuned model was evaluated using quantitative
metrics,including Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) and Multi-Scale Structural
Similarity (MS-SSIM), showing improvements in image quality and semantic
consistency with the text prompts. To further evaluate the model's potential, a
simple classification task was carried out using a small 0.35T MRI dataset,
demonstrating that the synthetic images generated by the fine-tuned SD model
can effectively augment training datasets and improve the performance of MRI
constrast classification tasks. Overall, our findings suggest that
text-prompted MRI image generation is feasible and can serve as a useful tool
for medical AI applications.

Motivation: 传统连接组生成方法耗时且依赖灰质分区，限制了大规模研究。DeepMultiConnectome旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 使用基于点云的神经网络和多任务学习，模型分类流线并共享学习表示，支持两种灰质分区方案。

Result: 模型在40秒内预测出连接组，与传统方法结果高度相关（r=0.992和0.986），网络属性保留良好，且可重复性和预测性能与传统方法相当。

Conclusion: DeepMultiConnectome为跨多种分区方案生成个体化连接组提供了快速、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) tractography enables in vivo mapping of brain structural
connections, but traditional connectome generation is time-consuming and
requires gray matter parcellation, posing challenges for large-scale studies.
We introduce DeepMultiConnectome, a deep-learning model that predicts
structural connectomes directly from tractography, bypassing the need for gray
matter parcellation while supporting multiple parcellation schemes. Using a
point-cloud-based neural network with multi-task learning, the model classifies
streamlines according to their connected regions across two parcellation
schemes, sharing a learned representation. We train and validate
DeepMultiConnectome on tractography from the Human Connectome Project Young
Adult dataset ($n = 1000$), labeled with an 84 and 164 region gray matter
parcellation scheme. DeepMultiConnectome predicts multiple structural
connectomes from a whole-brain tractogram containing 3 million streamlines in
approximately 40 seconds. DeepMultiConnectome is evaluated by comparing
predicted connectomes with traditional connectomes generated using the
conventional method of labeling streamlines using a gray matter parcellation.
The predicted connectomes are highly correlated with traditionally generated
connectomes ($r = 0.992$ for an 84-region scheme; $r = 0.986$ for a 164-region
scheme) and largely preserve network properties. A test-retest analysis of
DeepMultiConnectome demonstrates reproducibility comparable to traditionally
generated connectomes. The predicted connectomes perform similarly to
traditionally generated connectomes in predicting age and cognitive function.
Overall, DeepMultiConnectome provides a scalable, fast model for generating
subject-specific connectomes across multiple parcellation schemes.

Motivation: 传统方法依赖显式先验或单独参数估计，无法灵活处理盲逆问题。

Method: 使用两个扩散模型作为学习先验，分别捕捉目标图像分布和测量算子参数，通过交替高斯去噪方案实现后验采样。

Result: 在盲图像去模糊任务中，Blind-PnPDM在定量指标和视觉保真度上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 将盲逆问题视为一系列去噪子问题，并利用扩散模型的表达能力，是一种有效的方法。

Abstract: We introduce Blind Plug-and-Play Diffusion Models (Blind-PnPDM) as a novel
framework for solving blind inverse problems where both the target image and
the measurement operator are unknown. Unlike conventional methods that rely on
explicit priors or separate parameter estimation, our approach performs
posterior sampling by recasting the problem into an alternating Gaussian
denoising scheme. We leverage two diffusion models as learned priors: one to
capture the distribution of the target image and another to characterize the
parameters of the measurement operator. This PnP integration of diffusion
models ensures flexibility and ease of adaptation. Our experiments on blind
image deblurring show that Blind-PnPDM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
terms of both quantitative metrics and visual fidelity. Our results highlight
the effectiveness of treating blind inverse problems as a sequence of denoising
subproblems while harnessing the expressive power of diffusion-based priors.

Method: 通过生成合成定量磁化率图，结合多通道扩展和概率分割图，利用生成对抗网络（GAN）进行数据增强和去噪处理。

Abstract: Quantitative susceptibility maps from magnetic resonance images can provide
both prognostic and diagnostic information in multiple sclerosis, a
neurodegenerative disease characterized by the formation of lesions in white
matter brain tissue. In particular, susceptibility maps provide adequate
contrast to distinguish between "rim" lesions, surrounded by deposited
paramagnetic iron, and "non-rim" lesion types. These paramagnetic rim lesions
(PRLs) are an emerging biomarker in multiple sclerosis. Much effort has been
devoted to both detection and segmentation of such lesions to monitor
longitudinal change. As paramagnetic rim lesions are rare, addressing this
problem requires confronting the class imbalance between rim and non-rim
lesions. We produce synthetic quantitative susceptibility maps of paramagnetic
rim lesions and show that inclusion of such synthetic data improves classifier
performance and provide a multi-channel extension to generate accompanying
contrasts and probabilistic segmentation maps. We exploit the projection
capability of our trained generative network to demonstrate a novel denoising
approach that allows us to train on ambiguous rim cases and substantially
increase the minority class. We show that both synthetic lesion synthesis and
our proposed rim lesion label denoising method best approximate the unseen rim
lesion distribution and improve detection in a clinically interpretable manner.
We release our code and generated data at https://github.com/agr78/PRLx-GAN
upon publication.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种自监督特征学习辅助的MRI重建框架（SSFL-Recon），解决了现有监督学习方法对全采样图像的依赖问题，并在实验中表现出优于现有自监督方法甚至接近监督学习的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在MRI重建中依赖全采样图像，但全采样图像获取困难且可能引入偏差，而临床中大量欠采样数据未被充分利用。

Method: 首先在欠采样图像上训练自监督特征提取器，学习采样不敏感特征，然后将这些特征嵌入自监督重建网络以辅助去除伪影。

Result: 在2D心脏Cine数据集上的实验表明，SSFL-Recon优于现有自监督方法，甚至在16倍欠采样下性能接近或优于监督学习。

Conclusion: 自监督特征学习能有效提取全局表示，有助于去除伪影并提高重建的泛化能力。

Abstract: We propose a self-supervised feature learning assisted reconstruction
(SSFL-Recon) framework for MRI reconstruction to address the limitation of
existing supervised learning methods. Although recent deep learning-based
methods have shown promising performance in MRI reconstruction, most require
fully-sampled images for supervised learning, which is challenging in practice
considering long acquisition times under respiratory or organ motion. Moreover,
nearly all fully-sampled datasets are obtained from conventional reconstruction
of mildly accelerated datasets, thus potentially biasing the achievable
performance. The numerous undersampled datasets with different accelerations in
clinical practice, hence, remain underutilized. To address these issues, we
first train a self-supervised feature extractor on undersampled images to learn
sampling-insensitive features. The pre-learned features are subsequently
embedded in the self-supervised reconstruction network to assist in removing
artifacts. Experiments were conducted retrospectively on an in-house 2D cardiac
Cine dataset, including 91 cardiovascular patients and 38 healthy subjects. The
results demonstrate that the proposed SSFL-Recon framework outperforms existing
self-supervised MRI reconstruction methods and even exhibits comparable or
better performance to supervised learning up to $16\times$ retrospective
undersampling. The feature learning strategy can effectively extract global
representations, which have proven beneficial in removing artifacts and
increasing generalization ability during reconstruction.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于DCT-2的低复杂度近似方法，用于降低大尺寸变换的计算和内存复杂度，同时保持编码效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频编解码器使用多种可分离变换（如DCT和DST）虽能提升编码增益，但大尺寸变换（32点及以上）的计算和内存复杂度过高，且实现效率不如DCT-2。

Method: 利用DCT-2计算，并通过正交调整近似目标变换的关键基向量，设计低复杂度的三角函数变换近似方法。

Result: 在VVC参考软件上的实验表明，该方法显著降低了计算复杂度，同时编码效率几乎不变。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了大尺寸变换的高复杂度问题，为视频编解码器提供了实用的低复杂度解决方案。

Abstract: Recent video codecs with multiple separable transforms can achieve
significant coding gains using asymmetric trigonometric transforms (DCTs and
DSTs), because they can exploit diverse statistics of residual block signals.
However, they add excessive computational and memory complexity on large
transforms (32-point and larger), since their practical software and hardware
implementations are not as efficient as of the DCT-2. This article introduces a
novel technique to design low-complexity approximations of trigonometric
transforms. The proposed method uses DCT-2 computations, and applies orthogonal
adjustments to approximate the most important basis vectors of the desired
transform. Experimental results on the Versatile Video Coding (VVC) reference
software show that the proposed approach significantly reduces the
computational complexity, while providing practically identical coding
efficiency.

TL;DR: 通过分析递归滤波器的有效性，提出非递归预测器，改进HEVC帧内预测，实现2.0%的比特率平均降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 递归滤波器虽能改进HEVC帧内预测，但阻碍并行计算，需探索非递归替代方案。

Method: 结合未滤波和滤波参考样本，根据预测模式和块大小设计非递归预测器。

Result: 在AI配置下，比特率平均降低2.0%。

Conclusion: 非递归预测器在保持并行计算能力的同时，显著提升HEVC帧内预测性能。

Abstract: Intra-frame prediction in the High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) standard
can be empirically improved by applying sets of recursive two-dimensional
filters to the predicted values. However, this approach does not allow (or
complicates significantly) the parallel computation of pixel predictions. In
this work we analyze why the recursive filters are effective, and use the
results to derive sets of non-recursive predictors that have superior
performance. We present an extension to HEVC intra prediction that combines
values predicted using non-filtered and filtered (smoothed) reference samples,
depending on the prediction mode, and block size. Simulations using the HEVC
common test conditions show that a 2.0% bit rate average reduction can be
achieved compared to HEVC, for All Intra (AI) configurations.

Conclusion: IRS为数字病理学中的实际应用提供了一种鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Continual learning is rapidly emerging as a key focus in computer vision,
aiming to develop AI systems capable of continuous improvement, thereby
enhancing their value and practicality in diverse real-world applications. In
healthcare, continual learning holds great promise for continuously acquired
digital pathology data, which is collected in hospitals on a daily basis.
However, panoramic segmentation on digital whole slide images (WSIs) presents
significant challenges, as it is often infeasible to obtain comprehensive
annotations for all potential objects, spanning from coarse structures (e.g.,
regions and unit objects) to fine structures (e.g., cells). This results in
temporally and partially annotated data, posing a major challenge in developing
a holistic segmentation framework. Moreover, an ideal segmentation model should
incorporate new phenotypes, unseen diseases, and diverse populations, making
this task even more complex. In this paper, we introduce a novel and unified
Incremental Relationship-guided Segmentation (IRS) learning scheme to address
temporally acquired, partially annotated data while maintaining
out-of-distribution (OOD) continual learning capacity in digital pathology. The
key innovation of IRS lies in its ability to realize a new spatial-temporal OOD
continual learning paradigm by mathematically modeling anatomical relationships
between existing and newly introduced classes through a simple incremental
universal proposition matrix. Experimental results demonstrate that the IRS
method effectively handles the multi-scale nature of pathological segmentation,
enabling precise kidney segmentation across various structures (regions, units,
and cells) as well as OOD disease lesions at multiple magnifications. This
capability significantly enhances domain generalization, making IRS a robust
approach for real-world digital pathology applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为iHDR的新框架，通过迭代融合多张低动态范围（LDR）图像生成高动态范围（HDR）图像，解决了现有方法输入数量固定的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HDR成像方法通常仅适用于固定数量的输入，无法灵活处理不同数量的输入帧。

Method: iHDR框架包括一个无重影的双输入HDR融合网络（DiHDR）和一个基于物理的域映射网络（ToneNet），通过迭代融合逐步生成HDR图像。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在输入帧数量灵活的情况下，优于现有的HDR去重影方法。

Conclusion: iHDR框架为HDR成像提供了一种灵活且高效的解决方案，适用于不同数量的输入帧。

Abstract: High dynamic range (HDR) imaging aims to obtain a high-quality HDR image by
fusing information from multiple low dynamic range (LDR) images. Numerous
learning-based HDR imaging methods have been proposed to achieve this for
static and dynamic scenes. However, their architectures are mostly tailored for
a fixed number (e.g., three) of inputs and, therefore, cannot apply directly to
situations beyond the pre-defined limited scope. To address this issue, we
propose a novel framework, iHDR, for iterative fusion, which comprises a
ghost-free Dual-input HDR fusion network (DiHDR) and a physics-based domain
mapping network (ToneNet). DiHDR leverages a pair of inputs to estimate an
intermediate HDR image, while ToneNet maps it back to the nonlinear domain and
serves as the reference input for the next pairwise fusion. This process is
iteratively executed until all input frames are utilized. Qualitative and
quantitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method
as compared to existing state-of-the-art HDR deghosting approaches given
flexible numbers of input frames.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决PnP方法在重建精度和速度上的局限性，以及深度展开方法在压缩比变化时需要微调或重新训练的问题。

Method: 设计了高效的深度图像恢复器（DIR）用于HQS和ADMM的展开，并提出了通用的近端轨迹（PT）损失函数来训练网络。

Conclusion: 通过结合PnP和深度展开方法的优势，论文提出的方法在单像素成像逆问题中实现了更高的灵活性和性能。

Abstract: Deep-unrolling and plug-and-play (PnP) approaches have become the de-facto
standard solvers for single-pixel imaging (SPI) inverse problem. PnP
approaches, a class of iterative algorithms where regularization is implicitly
performed by an off-the-shelf deep denoiser, are flexible for varying
compression ratios (CRs) but are limited in reconstruction accuracy and speed.
Conversely, unrolling approaches, a class of multi-stage neural networks where
a truncated iterative optimization process is transformed into an end-to-end
trainable network, typically achieve better accuracy with faster inference but
require fine-tuning or even retraining when CR changes. In this paper, we
address the challenge of integrating the strengths of both classes of solvers.
To this end, we design an efficient deep image restorer (DIR) for the unrolling
of HQS (half quadratic splitting) and ADMM (alternating direction method of
multipliers). More importantly, a general proximal trajectory (PT) loss
function is proposed to train HQS/ADMM-unrolling networks such that learned DIR
approximates the proximal operator of an ideal explicit restoration
regularizer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, the resulting proximal
unrolling networks can not only flexibly handle varying CRs with a single model
like PnP algorithms, but also outperform previous CR-specific unrolling
networks in both reconstruction accuracy and speed. Source codes and models are

Abstract: Remote sensing image super-resolution (RSISR) is a crucial task in remote
sensing image processing, aiming to reconstruct high-resolution (HR) images
from their low-resolution (LR) counterparts. Despite the growing number of
RSISR methods proposed in recent years, a systematic and comprehensive review
of these methods is still lacking. This paper presents a thorough review of
RSISR algorithms, covering methodologies, datasets, and evaluation metrics. We
provide an in-depth analysis of RSISR methods, categorizing them into
supervised, unsupervised, and quality evaluation approaches, to help
researchers understand current trends and challenges. Our review also discusses
the strengths, limitations, and inherent challenges of these techniques.
Notably, our analysis reveals significant limitations in existing methods,
particularly in preserving fine-grained textures and geometric structures under
large-scale degradation. Based on these findings, we outline future research
directions, highlighting the need for domain-specific architectures and robust
evaluation protocols to bridge the gap between synthetic and real-world RSISR
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割模型在跨数据集部署时外部有效性不足，尤其是在超声图像领域，现有方法如域适应和GAN风格迁移效果有限。

Method: 通过PCA预处理降噪并保留90%的数据方差，生成PCA重建数据集，训练U-Net模型，并在六个乳腺肿瘤超声数据集上验证。

Result: PCA重建数据集显著提升了模型在外部数据集上的召回率（0.57→0.70）和Dice分数（0.50→0.58），外部验证召回值下降减少了33%。

Conclusion: PCA重建是一种有效的方法，可提升医学图像分割模型的外部有效性，尤其在具有挑战性的案例中。

Abstract: In medical image segmentation, limited external validity remains a critical
obstacle when models are deployed across unseen datasets, an issue particularly
pronounced in the ultrasound image domain. Existing solutions-such as domain
adaptation and GAN-based style transfer-while promising, often fall short in
the medical domain where datasets are typically small and diverse. This paper
presents a novel application of principal component analysis (PCA) to address
this limitation. PCA preprocessing reduces noise and emphasizes essential
features by retaining approximately 90\% of the dataset variance. We evaluate
our approach across six diverse breast tumor ultrasound datasets comprising
3,983 B-mode images and corresponding expert tumor segmentation masks. For each
dataset, a corresponding dimensionality reduced PCA-dataset is created and
U-Net-based segmentation models are trained on each of the twelve datasets.
Each model trained on an original dataset was inferenced on the remaining five
out-of-domain original datasets (baseline results), while each model trained on
a PCA dataset was inferenced on five out-of-domain PCA datasets. Our
experimental results indicate that using PCA reconstructed datasets, instead of
original images, improves the model's recall and Dice scores, particularly for
model-dataset pairs where baseline performance was lowest, achieving
statistically significant gains in recall (0.57 $\pm$ 0.07 vs. 0.70 $\pm$ 0.05,
$p = 0.0004$) and Dice scores (0.50 $\pm$ 0.06 vs. 0.58 $\pm$ 0.06, $p =
0.03$). Our method reduced the decline in recall values due to external
validation by $33\%$. These findings underscore the potential of PCA
reconstruction as a safeguard to mitigate declines in segmentation performance,
especially in challenging cases, with implications for enhancing external
validity in real-world medical applications.

Abstract: Accurately predicting immunotherapy response in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
(NSCLC) remains a critical unmet need. Existing radiomics and deep
learning-based predictive models rely primarily on pre-treatment imaging to
predict categorical response outcomes, limiting their ability to capture the
complex morphological and textural transformations induced by immunotherapy.
This study introduces ImmunoDiff, an anatomy-aware diffusion model designed to
synthesize post-treatment CT scans from baseline imaging while incorporating
clinically relevant constraints. The proposed framework integrates anatomical
priors, specifically lobar and vascular structures, to enhance fidelity in CT
synthesis. Additionally, we introduce a novel cbi-Adapter, a conditioning
module that ensures pairwise-consistent multimodal integration of imaging and
clinical data embeddings, to refine the generative process. Additionally, a
clinical variable conditioning mechanism is introduced, leveraging demographic
data, blood-based biomarkers, and PD-L1 expression to refine the generative
process. Evaluations on an in-house NSCLC cohort treated with immune checkpoint
inhibitors demonstrate a 21.24% improvement in balanced accuracy for response
prediction and a 0.03 increase in c-index for survival prediction. Code will be
released soon.

Abstract: This paper contributes a set of quality metrics for identification and visual
analysis of structured missingness in high-dimensional data. Missing values in
data are a frequent challenge in most data generating domains and may cause a
range of analysis issues. Structural missingness in data may indicate issues in
data collection and pre-processing, but may also highlight important data
characteristics. While research into statistical methods for dealing with
missing data are mainly focusing on replacing missing values with plausible
estimated values, visualization has great potential to support a more in-depth
understanding of missingness structures in data. Nonetheless, while the
interest in missing data visualization has increased in the last decade, it is
still a relatively overlooked research topic with a comparably small number of
publications, few of which address scalability issues. Efficient visual
analysis approaches are needed to enable exploration of missingness structures
in large and high-dimensional data, and to support informed decision-making in
context of potential data quality issues. This paper suggests a set of quality
metrics for identification of patterns of interest for understanding of
structural missingness in data. These quality metrics can be used as guidance
in visual analysis, as demonstrated through a use case exploring structural
missingness in data from a real-life walking monitoring study. All supplemental

Abstract: Accurate depth estimation of magnetic sources plays a crucial role in various
geophysical applications, including mineral exploration, resource assessments,
regional hydrocarbon exploration, and geological mapping. Thus, this abstract
presents a fast and simple method of estimating the depth of a magnetic body
using the TDX derivative of the total magnetic field. TDX is a first-order
derivative of the magnetic field that, in addition to edge detection, is less
affected by noise, allowing for better depth resolution. The reduced
sensitivity to noise enables a clearer estimation of depth and enhances the
accuracy of the depth determination process. The TDX, as a variant of the phase
derivative, is independent of magnetization and can be used to identify the
edge of a magnetic body. In addition to excelling at edge detection, they can
also estimate the depth of the magnetic source producing the anomalies. In this
study, we explore the utilization of contour of the TDX derivative for
estimating depth, assuming a vertical contact source. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of the method using a two-prism block model and a simple bishop
model with a uniform susceptibility of 0.001 cgs. The results agree with the
known depth, providing evidence of the reliability of the method despite the
restrictive nature of the assumption, especially for the Bishop model, where
there are numerous fault structures.

is often the case that conformal classifiers produce uninformatively large
sets. In this work, we show that test-time augmentation (TTA)--a technique that
introduces inductive biases during inference--reduces the size of the sets
produced by conformal classifiers. Our approach is flexible, computationally
efficient, and effective. It can be combined with any conformal score, requires
no model retraining, and reduces prediction set sizes by 10%-14% on average. We
conduct an evaluation of the approach spanning three datasets, three models,
two established conformal scoring methods, different guarantee strengths, and
several distribution shifts to show when and why test-time augmentation is a
useful addition to the conformal pipeline.

Abstract: Finding the number of meaningful clusters in an unlabeled dataset is
important in many applications. Regularized k-means algorithm is a possible
approach frequently used to find the correct number of distinct clusters in
datasets. The most common formulation of the regularization function is the
additive linear term $\lambda k$, where $k$ is the number of clusters and
$\lambda$ a positive coefficient. Currently, there are no principled guidelines
for setting a value for the critical hyperparameter $\lambda$. In this paper,
we derive rigorous bounds for $\lambda$ assuming clusters are {\em ideal}.
Ideal clusters (defined as $d$-dimensional spheres with identical radii) are
close proxies for k-means clusters ($d$-dimensional spherically symmetric
distributions with identical standard deviations). Experiments show that the
k-means algorithm with additive regularizer often yields multiple solutions.
Thus, we also analyze k-means algorithm with multiplicative regularizer. The
consensus among k-means solutions with additive and multiplicative
regularizations reduces the ambiguity of multiple solutions in certain cases.
We also present selected experiments that demonstrate performance of the
regularized k-means algorithms as clusters deviate from the ideal assumption.

Abstract: The subpopulationtion shift, characterized by a disparity in subpopulation
distributibetween theween the training and target datasets, can significantly
degrade the performance of machine learning models. Current solutions to
subpopulation shift involve modifying empirical risk minimization with
re-weighting strategies to improve generalization. This strategy relies on
assumptions about the number and nature of subpopulations and annotations on
group membership, which are unavailable for many real-world datasets. Instead,
we propose using an ensemble of diverse classifiers to adaptively capture risk
associated with subpopulations. Given a feature extractor network, we replace
its standard linear classification layer with a mixture of prototypical
classifiers, where each member is trained to classify the data while focusing
on different features and samples from other members. In empirical evaluation
on nine real-world datasets, covering diverse domains and kinds of
subpopulation shift, our method of Diverse Prototypical Ensembles (DPEs) often
outperforms the prior state-of-the-art in worst-group accuracy. The code is

Result: 实验表明PMDG性能与MDG正相关，伪域在数据充足时可能匹配或超越真实多域性能。

Conclusion: PMDG为单源域泛化提供了实用解决方案，并为未来域泛化研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Deep learning models often struggle to maintain performance when deployed on
data distributions different from their training data, particularly in
real-world applications where environmental conditions frequently change. While
Multi-source Domain Generalization (MDG) has shown promise in addressing this
challenge by leveraging multiple source domains during training, its practical
application is limited by the significant costs and difficulties associated
with creating multi-domain datasets. To address this limitation, we propose
Pseudo Multi-source Domain Generalization (PMDG), a novel framework that
enables the application of sophisticated MDG algorithms in more practical
Single-source Domain Generalization (SDG) settings. PMDG generates multiple
pseudo-domains from a single source domain through style transfer and data
augmentation techniques, creating a synthetic multi-domain dataset that can be
used with existing MDG algorithms. Through extensive experiments with
PseudoDomainBed, our modified version of the DomainBed benchmark, we analyze
the effectiveness of PMDG across multiple datasets and architectures. Our
analysis reveals several key findings, including a positive correlation between
MDG and PMDG performance and the potential of pseudo-domains to match or exceed
actual multi-domain performance with sufficient data. These comprehensive
empirical results provide valuable insights for future research in domain
generalization. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 后验OOD检测方法为高效且隐私保护的开放世界类增量学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) poses significant challenges in open-world
scenarios, where models must not only learn new classes over time without
forgetting previous ones but also handle inputs from unknown classes that a
closed-set model would misclassify. Recent works address both issues by
(i)~training multi-head models using the task-incremental learning framework,
and (ii) predicting the task identity employing out-of-distribution (OOD)
detectors. While effective, the latter mainly relies on joint training with a
memory buffer of past data, raising concerns around privacy, scalability, and
increased training time. In this paper, we present an in-depth analysis of
post-hoc OOD detection methods and investigate their potential to eliminate the
need for a memory buffer. We uncover that these methods, when applied
appropriately at inference time, can serve as a strong substitute for
buffer-based OOD detection. We show that this buffer-free approach achieves
comparable or superior performance to buffer-based methods both in terms of
class-incremental learning and the rejection of unknown samples. Experimental
results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Tiny ImageNet datasets support our findings,
offering new insights into the design of efficient and privacy-preserving CIL
systems for open-world settings.

Motivation: 在现实场景中，意外输入不可避免，OOD检测和不确定性估计对构建安全的机器学习系统至关重要。

Result: 模型能够有效检测和拒绝OOD样本，并为预测提供不确定性估计。

Conclusion: 该方法无需外部OOD数据集或后处理校准，为OOD检测和不确定性估计提供了统一解决方案。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and uncertainty estimation (UE) are
critical components for building safe machine learning systems, especially in
real-world scenarios where unexpected inputs are inevitable. In this work, we
propose a novel framework that combines network inversion with classifier
training to simultaneously address both OOD detection and uncertainty
estimation. For a standard n-class classification task, we extend the
classifier to an (n+1)-class model by introducing a "garbage" class, initially
populated with random gaussian noise to represent outlier inputs. After each
training epoch, we use network inversion to reconstruct input images
corresponding to all output classes that initially appear as noisy and
incoherent and are therefore excluded to the garbage class for retraining the
classifier. This cycle of training, inversion, and exclusion continues
iteratively till the inverted samples begin to resemble the in-distribution
data more closely, suggesting that the classifier has learned to carve out
meaningful decision boundaries while sanitising the class manifolds by pushing
OOD content into the garbage class. During inference, this training scheme
enables the model to effectively detect and reject OOD samples by classifying
them into the garbage class. Furthermore, the confidence scores associated with
each prediction can be used to estimate uncertainty for both in-distribution
and OOD inputs. Our approach is scalable, interpretable, and does not require
access to external OOD datasets or post-hoc calibration techniques while
providing a unified solution to the dual challenges of OOD detection and
uncertainty estimation.

Result: 在质量和效率上优于大型自回归模型。

Conclusion: 离散扩散结合强视觉先验是统一生成任务的可扩展有效方法。

Abstract: Unified generation models aim to handle diverse tasks across modalities --
such as text generation, image generation, and vision-language reasoning --
within a single architecture and decoding paradigm. Autoregressive unified
models suffer from slow inference due to sequential decoding, and
non-autoregressive unified models suffer from weak generalization due to
limited pretrained backbones. We introduce Muddit, a unified discrete diffusion
transformer that enables fast and parallel generation across both text and
image modalities. Unlike prior unified diffusion models trained from scratch,
Muddit integrates strong visual priors from a pretrained text-to-image backbone
with a lightweight text decoder, enabling flexible and high-quality multimodal
generation under a unified architecture. Empirical results show that Muddit
achieves competitive or superior performance compared to significantly larger
autoregressive models in both quality and efficiency. The work highlights the
potential of purely discrete diffusion, when equipped with strong visual
priors, as a scalable and effective backbone for unified generation.

Conclusion: HDRQ是首个针对量化模型合并的研究，实验证明其有效性，为多目标领域适应提供了新思路。

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a powerful technique for combining task-specific
weights, achieving superior performance in multi-target domain adaptation.
However, when applied to practical scenarios, such as quantized models, new
challenges arise. In practical scenarios, quantization is often applied to
target-specific data, but this process restricts the domain of interest and
introduces discretization effects, making model merging highly non-trivial. In
this study, we analyze the impact of quantization on model merging through the
lens of error barriers. Leveraging these insights, we propose a novel
post-training quantization, HDRQ - Hessian and distant regularizing
quantization - that is designed to consider model merging for multi-target
domain adaptation. Our approach ensures that the quantization process incurs
minimal deviation from the source pre-trained model while flattening the loss
surface to facilitate smooth model merging. To our knowledge, this is the first
study on this challenge, and extensive experiments confirm its effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将图像展平为一维序列时通常采用固定顺序（如行优先），而现代长序列Transformer的架构近似破坏了排列不变性，导致性能受顺序影响。

Method: 提出两阶段框架REOrder：1）通过信息论评估不同块序列的可压缩性；2）使用REINFORCE优化Plackett-Luce策略学习最优排列。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K和Functional Map of the World上，REOrder分别提升Top-1准确率3.01%和13.35%。

Conclusion: REOrder通过任务优化的块排列顺序显著提升模型性能，证明了顺序对Transformer在视觉任务中的重要性。

Abstract: Sequence models such as transformers require inputs to be represented as
one-dimensional sequences. In vision, this typically involves flattening images
using a fixed row-major (raster-scan) order. While full self-attention is
permutation-equivariant, modern long-sequence transformers increasingly rely on
architectural approximations that break this invariance and introduce
sensitivity to patch ordering. We show that patch order significantly affects
model performance in such settings, with simple alternatives like column-major
or Hilbert curves yielding notable accuracy shifts. Motivated by this, we
propose REOrder, a two-stage framework for discovering task-optimal patch
orderings. First, we derive an information-theoretic prior by evaluating the
compressibility of various patch sequences. Then, we learn a policy over
permutations by optimizing a Plackett-Luce policy using REINFORCE. This
approach enables efficient learning in a combinatorial permutation space.
REOrder improves top-1 accuracy over row-major ordering on ImageNet-1K by up to
3.01% and Functional Map of the World by 13.35%.

Motivation: 现有DTI脑网络构建方法存在操作主观性、工作流程繁琐和拓扑特征捕捉能力有限等问题，需要更高效、自动化的解决方案。

Conclusion: ConnectomeDiffuser为神经退行性疾病的诊断和研究提供了更准确、通用的测量框架。

Abstract: Brain network analysis plays a crucial role in diagnosing and monitoring
neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Existing
approaches for constructing structural brain networks from diffusion tensor
imaging (DTI) often rely on specialized toolkits that suffer from inherent
limitations: operator subjectivity, labor-intensive workflows, and restricted
capacity to capture complex topological features and disease-specific
biomarkers. To overcome these challenges and advance computational neuroimaging
instrumentation, ConnectomeDiffuser is proposed as a novel diffusion-based
framework for automated end-to-end brain network construction from DTI. The
proposed model combines three key components: (1) a Template Network that
extracts topological features from 3D DTI scans using Riemannian geometric
principles, (2) a diffusion model that generates comprehensive brain networks
with enhanced topological fidelity, and (3) a Graph Convolutional Network
classifier that incorporates disease-specific markers to improve diagnostic
accuracy. ConnectomeDiffuser demonstrates superior performance by capturing a
broader range of structural connectivity and pathology-related information,
enabling more sensitive analysis of individual variations in brain networks.
Experimental validation on datasets representing two distinct neurodegenerative
conditions demonstrates significant performance improvements over other brain
network methods. This work contributes to the advancement of instrumentation in
the context of neurological disorders, providing clinicians and researchers
with a robust, generalizable measurement framework that facilitates more
accurate diagnosis, deeper mechanistic understanding, and improved therapeutic
monitoring of neurodegenerative diseases such as AD.

Motivation: 现有对抗攻击未考虑服务计算环境，而AdvOF填补了这一空白，探索对抗环境对VLM感知模块的影响。

Method: AdvOF通过精确对齐2D和3D空间中的目标对象位置，定义并渲染对抗对象，并通过多视角优化和正则化协作优化对抗对象。

Result: 评估表明，AdvOF能有效降低代理在对抗条件下的性能，同时对正常导航任务干扰最小。

Conclusion: AdvOF为VLM驱动的导航系统提供了服务安全性的新理解，并为物理世界部署中的鲁棒服务组合奠定了基础。

Abstract: We present Adversarial Object Fusion (AdvOF), a novel attack framework
targeting vision-and-language navigation (VLN) agents in service-oriented
environments by generating adversarial 3D objects. While foundational models
like Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) have
enhanced service-oriented navigation systems through improved perception and
decision-making, their integration introduces vulnerabilities in
mission-critical service workflows. Existing adversarial attacks fail to
address service computing contexts, where reliability and quality-of-service
(QoS) are paramount. We utilize AdvOF to investigate and explore the impact of
adversarial environments on the VLM-based perception module of VLN agents. In
particular, AdvOF first precisely aggregates and aligns the victim object
positions in both 2D and 3D space, defining and rendering adversarial objects.
Then, we collaboratively optimize the adversarial object with regularization
between the adversarial and victim object across physical properties and VLM
perceptions. Through assigning importance weights to varying views, the
optimization is processed stably and multi-viewedly by iterative fusions from
local updates and justifications. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate AdvOF
can effectively degrade agent performance under adversarial conditions while
maintaining minimal interference with normal navigation tasks. This work
advances the understanding of service security in VLM-powered navigation
systems, providing computational foundations for robust service composition in
physical-world deployments.

Abstract: Perfusion imaging is extensively utilized to assess hemodynamic status and
tissue perfusion in various organs. Computed tomography perfusion (CTP) imaging
plays a key role in the early assessment and planning of stroke treatment.
While CTP provides essential perfusion parameters to identify abnormal blood
flow in the brain, the use of contrast agents in CTP can lead to allergic
reactions and adverse side effects, along with costing USD 4.9 billion
worldwide in 2022. To address these challenges, we propose a novel deep
learning framework called Multitask Automated Generation of Intermodal CT
perfusion maps (MAGIC). This framework combines generative artificial
intelligence and physiological information to map non-contrast computed
tomography (CT) imaging to multiple contrast-free CTP imaging maps. We
demonstrate enhanced image fidelity by incorporating physiological
characteristics into the loss terms. Our network was trained and validated
using CT image data from patients referred for stroke at UF Health and
demonstrated robustness to abnormalities in brain perfusion activity. A
double-blinded study was conducted involving seven experienced
neuroradiologists and vascular neurologists. This study validated MAGIC's
visual quality and diagnostic accuracy showing favorable performance compared
to clinical perfusion imaging with intravenous contrast injection. Overall,
MAGIC holds great promise in revolutionizing healthcare by offering
contrast-free, cost-effective, and rapid perfusion imaging.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has propelled
the development of pure-vision-based GUI Agents, capable of perceiving and
operating Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) to autonomously fulfill user
instructions. However, existing approaches usually adopt an offline learning
framework, which faces two core limitations: (1) heavy reliance on high-quality
manual annotations for element grounding and action supervision, and (2)
limited adaptability to dynamic and interactive environments. To address these
limitations, we propose ZeroGUI, a scalable, online learning framework for
automating GUI Agent training at Zero human cost. Specifically, ZeroGUI
integrates (i) VLM-based automatic task generation to produce diverse training
goals from the current environment state, (ii) VLM-based automatic reward
estimation to assess task success without hand-crafted evaluation functions,
and (iii) two-stage online reinforcement learning to continuously interact with
and learn from GUI environments. Experiments on two advanced GUI Agents
(UI-TARS and Aguvis) demonstrate that ZeroGUI significantly boosts performance

Abstract: Question answering (QA) systems are designed to answer natural language
questions. Visual QA (VQA) and Spoken QA (SQA) systems extend the textual QA
system to accept visual and spoken input respectively.
  This work aims to create a system that enables user interaction through both
speech and images. That is achieved through the fusion of text, speech, and
image modalities to tackle the task of spoken VQA (SVQA). The resulting
multi-modal model has textual, visual, and spoken inputs and can answer spoken
questions on images.
  Training and evaluating SVQA models requires a dataset for all three
modalities, but no such dataset currently exists. We address this problem by
synthesizing VQA datasets using two zero-shot TTS models. Our initial findings
indicate that a model trained only with synthesized speech nearly reaches the
performance of the upper-bounding model trained on textual QAs. In addition, we
show that the choice of the TTS model has a minor impact on accuracy.

Abstract: Multilook coherent imaging is a widely used technique in applications such as
digital holography, ultrasound imaging, and synthetic aperture radar. A central
challenge in these systems is the presence of multiplicative noise, commonly
known as speckle, which degrades image quality. Despite the widespread use of
coherent imaging systems, their theoretical foundations remain relatively
underexplored. In this paper, we study both the theoretical and algorithmic
aspects of likelihood-based approaches for multilook coherent imaging,
providing a rigorous framework for analysis and method development. Our
theoretical contributions include establishing the first theoretical upper
bound on the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of the maximum likelihood estimator under
the deep image prior hypothesis. Our results capture the dependence of MSE on
the number of parameters in the deep image prior, the number of looks, the
signal dimension, and the number of measurements per look. On the algorithmic
side, we employ projected gradient descent (PGD) as an efficient method for
computing the maximum likelihood solution. Furthermore, we introduce two key
ideas to enhance the practical performance of PGD. First, we incorporate the
Newton-Schulz algorithm to compute matrix inverses within the PGD iterations,
significantly reducing computational complexity. Second, we develop a bagging
strategy to mitigate projection errors introduced during PGD updates. We
demonstrate that combining these techniques with PGD yields state-of-the-art
performance. Our code is available at

Abstract: In 3D speech-driven facial animation generation, existing methods commonly
employ pre-trained self-supervised audio models as encoders. However, due to
the prevalence of phonetically similar syllables with distinct lip shapes in
language, these near-homophone syllables tend to exhibit significant coupling
in self-supervised audio feature spaces, leading to the averaging effect in
subsequent lip motion generation. To address this issue, this paper proposes a
plug-and-play semantic decorrelation module-Wav2Sem. This module extracts
semantic features corresponding to the entire audio sequence, leveraging the
added semantic information to decorrelate audio encodings within the feature
space, thereby achieving more expressive audio features. Extensive experiments
across multiple Speech-driven models indicate that the Wav2Sem module
effectively decouples audio features, significantly alleviating the averaging
effect of phonetically similar syllables in lip shape generation, thereby
enhancing the precision and naturalness of facial animations. Our source code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频信号作为输入比文本更自然直观，但现有方法通常仅关注动作与音乐或语音节奏的匹配，导致音频语义与生成动作关联较弱。

Result: 实验表明，音频指令能传达与文本相似的语义，同时提供更实用和用户友好的交互方式。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了音频语义与动作生成的弱关联问题，展示了音频在交互中的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in interactive technologies have highlighted the prominence
of audio signals for semantic encoding. This paper explores a new task, where
audio signals are used as conditioning inputs to generate motions that align
with the semantics of the audio. Unlike text-based interactions, audio provides
a more natural and intuitive communication method. However, existing methods
typically focus on matching motions with music or speech rhythms, which often
results in a weak connection between the semantics of the audio and generated
motions. We propose an end-to-end framework using a masked generative
transformer, enhanced by a memory-retrieval attention module to handle sparse
and lengthy audio inputs. Additionally, we enrich existing datasets by
converting descriptions into conversational style and generating corresponding
audio with varied speaker identities. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
and efficiency of the proposed framework, demonstrating that audio instructions
can convey semantics similar to text while providing more practical and
user-friendly interactions.

TL;DR: ZeroSep利用预训练的文本引导音频扩散模型实现零样本音频源分离，无需任务特定训练，支持开放场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前监督深度学习方法需要大量标注数据且难以泛化到真实世界复杂声学场景。

Method: 通过将混合音频反转到扩散模型的潜在空间，利用文本条件引导去噪过程分离源。

Result: 在多个分离基准上表现优异，甚至超越监督方法。

Conclusion: ZeroSep展示了生成扩散模型在判别任务中的潜力，支持开放场景。

Abstract: Audio source separation is fundamental for machines to understand complex
acoustic environments and underpins numerous audio applications. Current
supervised deep learning approaches, while powerful, are limited by the need
for extensive, task-specific labeled data and struggle to generalize to the
immense variability and open-set nature of real-world acoustic scenes. Inspired
by the success of generative foundation models, we investigate whether
pre-trained text-guided audio diffusion models can overcome these limitations.
We make a surprising discovery: zero-shot source separation can be achieved
purely through a pre-trained text-guided audio diffusion model under the right
configuration. Our method, named ZeroSep, works by inverting the mixed audio
into the diffusion model's latent space and then using text conditioning to
guide the denoising process to recover individual sources. Without any
task-specific training or fine-tuning, ZeroSep repurposes the generative
diffusion model for a discriminative separation task and inherently supports
open-set scenarios through its rich textual priors. ZeroSep is compatible with
a variety of pre-trained text-guided audio diffusion backbones and delivers
strong separation performance on multiple separation benchmarks, surpassing
even supervised methods.

Motivation: 预训练多模态表示（如CLIP）虽表现出强大能力，但其组合脆弱性导致反直觉判断，需系统评估和改进。

Method: 引入MAC基准，利用LLMs生成欺骗性文本样本，提出自训练方法，结合拒绝采样微调和多样性促进过滤。

Result: 使用较小语言模型（如Llama-3.1-8B），方法在多模态表示（图像、视频、音频）中展现出更高的攻击成功率和样本多样性。

Conclusion: MAC基准和自训练方法有效揭示了多模态表示的组合脆弱性，并提升了零样本方法的性能。

Abstract: While pre-trained multimodal representations (e.g., CLIP) have shown
impressive capabilities, they exhibit significant compositional vulnerabilities
leading to counterintuitive judgments. We introduce Multimodal Adversarial
Compositionality (MAC), a benchmark that leverages large language models (LLMs)
to generate deceptive text samples to exploit these vulnerabilities across
different modalities and evaluates them through both sample-wise attack success
rate and group-wise entropy-based diversity. To improve zero-shot methods, we
propose a self-training approach that leverages rejection-sampling fine-tuning
with diversity-promoting filtering, which enhances both attack success rate and
sample diversity. Using smaller language models like Llama-3.1-8B, our approach
demonstrates superior performance in revealing compositional vulnerabilities
across various multimodal representations, including images, videos, and
audios.

Result: VLM在否定问题上表现显著下降，且模型规模扩展呈现U型趋势。

Conclusion: NegVQA揭示了VLM在否定理解上的关键不足，为未来VLM发展提供了方向。

Abstract: Negation is a fundamental linguistic phenomenon that can entirely reverse the
meaning of a sentence. As vision language models (VLMs) continue to advance and
are deployed in high-stakes applications, assessing their ability to comprehend
negation becomes essential. To address this, we introduce NegVQA, a visual
question answering (VQA) benchmark consisting of 7,379 two-choice questions
covering diverse negation scenarios and image-question distributions. We
construct NegVQA by leveraging large language models to generate negated
versions of questions from existing VQA datasets. Evaluating 20
state-of-the-art VLMs across seven model families, we find that these models
struggle significantly with negation, exhibiting a substantial performance drop
compared to their responses to the original questions. Furthermore, we uncover
a U-shaped scaling trend, where increasing model size initially degrades
performance on NegVQA before leading to improvements. Our benchmark reveals
critical gaps in VLMs' negation understanding and offers insights into future
VLM development. Project page available at

Motivation: 视觉谜题（rebus puzzles）需要多模态抽象、符号推理和文化语言双关的理解，这对现有VLMs提出了独特挑战。

Method: 构建了一个手工生成和标注的英语视觉谜题基准，涵盖从简单图像替换到空间依赖提示的多种类型。

Result: VLMs在解码简单视觉线索时表现尚可，但在需要抽象推理、横向思维和视觉隐喻理解的任务中表现不佳。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs在解决复杂视觉谜题时仍有明显局限，尤其是在抽象和隐喻推理方面。

Abstract: Rebus puzzles, visual riddles that encode language through imagery, spatial
arrangement, and symbolic substitution, pose a unique challenge to current
vision-language models (VLMs). Unlike traditional image captioning or question
answering tasks, rebus solving requires multi-modal abstraction, symbolic
reasoning, and a grasp of cultural, phonetic and linguistic puns. In this
paper, we investigate the capacity of contemporary VLMs to interpret and solve
rebus puzzles by constructing a hand-generated and annotated benchmark of
diverse English-language rebus puzzles, ranging from simple pictographic
substitutions to spatially-dependent cues ("head" over "heels"). We analyze how
different VLMs perform, and our findings reveal that while VLMs exhibit some
surprising capabilities in decoding simple visual clues, they struggle
significantly with tasks requiring abstract reasoning, lateral thinking, and
understanding visual metaphors.

TL;DR: CF-DETR通过粗到细的Transformer架构和实时调度框架NPFP**，解决了多DETR任务在自动驾驶系统中的实时性和高精度需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有实时DNN调度方法未充分利用Transformer特性，难以满足自动驾驶系统对实时性和高精度的双重需求。

Method: CF-DETR采用粗到细推理、选择性细推理和多级批量推理策略，结合NPFP**调度框架动态调整资源分配。

Result: 实验表明，CF-DETR在多种平台上均能保证关键操作的实时性，并显著提高检测精度。

Conclusion: CF-DETR为自动驾驶感知系统提供了一种高效、实时的Transformer解决方案。

Abstract: Detection Transformers (DETR) are increasingly adopted in autonomous vehicle
(AV) perception systems due to their superior accuracy over convolutional
networks. However, concurrently executing multiple DETR tasks presents
significant challenges in meeting firm real-time deadlines (R1) and high
accuracy requirements (R2), particularly for safety-critical objects, while
navigating the inherent latency-accuracy trade-off under resource constraints.
Existing real-time DNN scheduling approaches often treat models generically,
failing to leverage Transformer-specific properties for efficient resource
allocation. To address these challenges, we propose CF-DETR, an integrated
system featuring a novel coarse-to-fine Transformer architecture and a
dedicated real-time scheduling framework NPFP**. CF-DETR employs three key
strategies (A1: coarse-to-fine inference, A2: selective fine inference, A3:
multi-level batch inference) that exploit Transformer properties to dynamically
adjust patch granularity and attention scope based on object criticality,
aiming to satisfy R2. The NPFP** scheduling framework (A4) orchestrates these
adaptive mechanisms A1-A3. It partitions each DETR task into a safety-critical
coarse subtask for guaranteed critical object detection within its deadline
(ensuring R1), and an optional fine subtask for enhanced overall accuracy (R2),
while managing individual and batched execution. Our extensive evaluations on
server, GPU-enabled embedded platforms, and actual AV platforms demonstrate
that CF-DETR, under an NPFP** policy, successfully meets strict timing
guarantees for critical operations and achieves significantly higher overall
and critical object detection accuracy compared to existing baselines across
diverse AV workloads.

Abstract: Memristor technology shows great promise for energy-efficient computing, yet
it grapples with challenges like resistance drift and inherent variability. For
filamentary Resistive RAM (ReRAM), one of the most investigated types of
memristive devices, the expensive electroforming step required to create
conductive pathways results in increased power and area overheads and reduced
endurance. In this study, we present novel HfO2-based forming-free ReRAM
devices, PdNeuRAM, that operate at low voltages, support multi-bit
functionality, and display reduced variability. Through a deep understanding
and comprehensive material characterization, we discover the key process that
allows this unique behavior: a Pd-O-Hf configuration that capitalizes on Pd
innate affinity for integrating into HfO2. This structure actively facilitates
charge redistribution at room temperature, effectively eliminating the need for
electroforming. Moreover, the fabricated ReRAM device provides tunable
resistance states for dense memory and reduces programming and reading energy
by 43% and 73%, respectively, using spiking neural networks (SNN). This study
reveals novel mechanistic insights and delineates a strategic roadmap for the
realization of power-efficient and cost-effective ReRAM devices.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究HMD渲染和视角误差如何影响用户对深度和距离的感知，并提出解决方案。

Method: 构建几何框架预测误差，并在Quest 3 HMD平台上进行实验验证。

Result: 透视几何误差会导致距离感知的偏差，但实时视觉反馈可动态校准视动映射。

Conclusion: 几何框架有效，实时反馈可改善HMD中的距离感知问题。

Abstract: Stereoscopic head-mounted displays (HMDs) render and present binocular images
to create an egocentric, 3D percept to the HMD user. Within this render and
presentation pipeline there are potential rendering camera and viewing position
errors that can induce deviations in the depth and distance that a user
perceives compared to the underlying intended geometry. For example, rendering
errors can arise when HMD render cameras are incorrectly positioned relative to
the assumed centers of projections of the HMD displays and viewing errors can
arise when users view stereo geometry from the incorrect location in the HMD
eyebox. In this work we present a geometric framework that predicts errors in
distance perception arising from inaccurate HMD perspective geometry and build
an HMD platform to reliably simulate render and viewing error in a Quest 3 HMD
with eye tracking to experimentally test these predictions. We present a series
of five experiments to explore the efficacy of this geometric framework and
show that errors in perspective geometry can induce both under- and
over-estimations in perceived distance. We further demonstrate how real-time
visual feedback can be used to dynamically recalibrate visuomotor mapping so
that an accurate reach distance is achieved even if the perceived visual
distance is negatively impacted by geometric error.

Result: 在RGBDGaze和MotionGaze数据集上，视线估计误差分别降低19.9%和31.7%。

Conclusion: MAC-Gaze为移动场景下的视线估计提供了鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Mobile gaze tracking faces a fundamental challenge: maintaining accuracy as
users naturally change their postures and device orientations. Traditional
calibration approaches, like one-off, fail to adapt to these dynamic
conditions, leading to degraded performance over time. We present MAC-Gaze, a
Motion-Aware continual Calibration approach that leverages smartphone Inertial
measurement unit (IMU) sensors and continual learning techniques to
automatically detect changes in user motion states and update the gaze tracking
model accordingly. Our system integrates a pre-trained visual gaze estimator
and an IMU-based activity recognition model with a clustering-based hybrid
decision-making mechanism that triggers recalibration when motion patterns
deviate significantly from previously encountered states. To enable
accumulative learning of new motion conditions while mitigating catastrophic
forgetting, we employ replay-based continual learning, allowing the model to
maintain performance across previously encountered motion conditions. We
evaluate our system through extensive experiments on the publicly available
RGBDGaze dataset and our own 10-hour multimodal MotionGaze dataset (481K+
images, 800K+ IMU readings), encompassing a wide range of postures under
various motion conditions including sitting, standing, lying, and walking.
Results demonstrate that our method reduces gaze estimation error by 19.9% on
RGBDGaze (from 1.73 cm to 1.41 cm) and by 31.7% on MotionGaze (from 2.81 cm to
1.92 cm) compared to traditional calibration approaches. Our framework provides
a robust solution for maintaining gaze estimation accuracy in mobile scenarios.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has significantly advanced the control of
physics-based and robotic characters that track kinematic reference motion.
However, methods typically rely on a weighted sum of conflicting reward
functions, requiring extensive tuning to achieve a desired behavior. Due to the
computational cost of RL, this iterative process is a tedious, time-intensive
task. Furthermore, for robotics applications, the weights need to be chosen
such that the policy performs well in the real world, despite inevitable
sim-to-real gaps. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-objective
reinforcement learning framework that trains a single policy conditioned on a
set of weights, spanning the Pareto front of reward trade-offs. Within this
framework, weights can be selected and tuned after training, significantly
speeding up iteration time. We demonstrate how this improved workflow can be
used to perform highly dynamic motions with a robot character. Moreover, we
explore how weight-conditioned policies can be leveraged in hierarchical
settings, using a high-level policy to dynamically select weights according to
the current task. We show that the multi-objective policy encodes a diverse
spectrum of behaviors, facilitating efficient adaptation to novel tasks.

Abstract: In order to navigate safely and reliably in off-road and unstructured
environments, robots must detect anomalies that are out-of-distribution (OOD)
with respect to the training data. We present an analysis-by-synthesis approach
for pixel-wise anomaly detection without making any assumptions about the
nature of OOD data. Given an input image, we use a generative diffusion model
to synthesize an edited image that removes anomalies while keeping the
remaining image unchanged. Then, we formulate anomaly detection as analyzing
which image segments were modified by the diffusion model. We propose a novel
inference approach for guided diffusion by analyzing the ideal guidance
gradient and deriving a principled approximation that bootstraps the diffusion
model to predict guidance gradients. Our editing technique is purely test-time
that can be integrated into existing workflows without the need for retraining
or fine-tuning. Finally, we use a combination of vision-language foundation
models to compare pixels in a learned feature space and detect semantically
meaningful edits, enabling accurate anomaly detection for off-road navigation.

Abstract: Embodied visual tracking is a fundamental skill in Embodied AI, enabling an
agent to follow a specific target in dynamic environments using only egocentric
vision. This task is inherently challenging as it requires both accurate target
recognition and effective trajectory planning under conditions of severe
occlusion and high scene dynamics. Existing approaches typically address this
challenge through a modular separation of recognition and planning. In this
work, we propose TrackVLA, a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model that learns the
synergy between object recognition and trajectory planning. Leveraging a shared
LLM backbone, we employ a language modeling head for recognition and an
anchor-based diffusion model for trajectory planning. To train TrackVLA, we
construct an Embodied Visual Tracking Benchmark (EVT-Bench) and collect diverse
difficulty levels of recognition samples, resulting in a dataset of 1.7 million
samples. Through extensive experiments in both synthetic and real-world
environments, TrackVLA demonstrates SOTA performance and strong
generalizability. It significantly outperforms existing methods on public
benchmarks in a zero-shot manner while remaining robust to high dynamics and
occlusion in real-world scenarios at 10 FPS inference speed. Our project page

Abstract: Controllable trajectory generation guided by high-level semantic decisions,
termed meta-actions, is crucial for autonomous driving systems. A significant
limitation of existing frameworks is their reliance on invariant meta-actions
assigned over fixed future time intervals, causing temporal misalignment with
the actual behavior trajectories. This misalignment leads to irrelevant
associations between the prescribed meta-actions and the resulting
trajectories, disrupting task coherence and limiting model performance. To
address this challenge, we introduce Autoregressive Meta-Actions, an approach
integrated into autoregressive trajectory generation frameworks that provides a
unified and precise definition for meta-action-conditioned trajectory
prediction. Specifically, We decompose traditional long-interval meta-actions
into frame-level meta-actions, enabling a sequential interplay between
autoregressive meta-action prediction and meta-action-conditioned trajectory
generation. This decomposition ensures strict alignment between each trajectory
segment and its corresponding meta-action, achieving a consistent and unified
task formulation across the entire trajectory span and significantly reducing
complexity. Moreover, we propose a staged pre-training process to decouple the
learning of basic motion dynamics from the integration of high-level decision
control, which offers flexibility, stability, and modularity. Experimental
results validate our framework's effectiveness, demonstrating improved
trajectory adaptivity and responsiveness to dynamic decision-making scenarios.

Abstract: Learned visuomotor policies are capable of performing increasingly complex
manipulation tasks. However, most of these policies are trained on data
collected from limited robot positions and camera viewpoints. This leads to
poor generalization to novel robot positions, which limits the use of these
policies on mobile platforms, especially for precise tasks like pressing
buttons or turning faucets. In this work, we formulate the policy mobilization
problem: find a mobile robot base pose in a novel environment that is in
distribution with respect to a manipulation policy trained on a limited set of
camera viewpoints. Compared to retraining the policy itself to be more robust
to unseen robot base pose initializations, policy mobilization decouples
navigation from manipulation and thus does not require additional
demonstrations. Crucially, this problem formulation complements existing
efforts to improve manipulation policy robustness to novel viewpoints and
remains compatible with them. To study policy mobilization, we introduce the
Mobi-$\pi$ framework, which includes: (1) metrics that quantify the difficulty
of mobilizing a given policy, (2) a suite of simulated mobile manipulation
tasks based on RoboCasa to evaluate policy mobilization, (3) visualization
tools for analysis, and (4) several baseline methods. We also propose a novel
approach that bridges navigation and manipulation by optimizing the robot's
base pose to align with an in-distribution base pose for a learned policy. Our
approach utilizes 3D Gaussian Splatting for novel view synthesis, a score
function to evaluate pose suitability, and sampling-based optimization to
identify optimal robot poses. We show that our approach outperforms baselines
in both simulation and real-world environments, demonstrating its effectiveness
for policy mobilization.
