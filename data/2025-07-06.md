### [2] [Underwater Monocular Metric Depth Estimation: Real-World Benchmarks and Synthetic Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02148)
*Zijie Cai,Christopher Metzler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文评估了单目深度估计模型在水下环境中的性能，发现现有模型因域偏移表现不佳，提出了一种基于合成水下数据的微调方法，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下环境中单目深度估计的可靠性受限于光线衰减、散射、颜色失真等问题，且缺乏高质量的真实数据，因此需要研究如何提升模型在水下环境中的表现。

Method: 通过微调Depth Anything V2模型（使用ViT-S编码器），基于合成的Hypersim水下数据集进行训练，并与其他模型在真实水下数据集（如FLSea和SQUID）上进行对比评估。

Result: 微调后的模型在所有基准测试中表现优于仅基于陆地数据训练的基线模型，证明了域适应和尺度感知监督的重要性。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过域适应和合成数据训练可以显著提升水下环境中单目深度估计的鲁棒性和泛化能力，为未来研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation has recently advanced to provide not only relative
but also metric depth predictions. However, its reliability in underwater
environments remains limited due to light attenuation and scattering, color
distortion, turbidity, and the lack of high-quality metric ground-truth data.
In this paper, we present a comprehensive benchmark of zero-shot and fine-tuned
monocular metric depth estimation models on real-world underwater datasets with
metric depth annotations, such as FLSea and SQUID. We evaluate a diverse set of
state-of-the-art models across a range of underwater conditions with different
ranges. Our results show that large-scale models trained on terrestrial (real
or synthetic) data, while effective in in-air settings, perform poorly
underwater due to significant domain shifts. To address this, we fine-tune
Depth Anything V2 with a ViT-S backbone encoder on a synthetic underwater
variant of the Hypersim dataset, which we generated using a physically based
underwater image formation model. We demonstrate our fine-tuned model
consistently improves performance across all benchmarks and outperforms
baselines trained only on the clean in-air Hypersim dataset. Our study provides
a detailed evaluation and visualization for monocular metric depth estimation
in underwater scenes, highlighting the importance of domain adaptation and
scale-aware supervision for achieving robust and generalizable metric depth
predictions in challenging underwater environments for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有网格标记化方法存在顶点重复问题，浪费网络能力，需要更高效的表示方法。

Method: 通过仅访问每个顶点一次的方式标记化网格顶点，减少50%的冗余，并实现约22%的压缩率。

Result: 生成的网格具有优越的几何特性（如流形拓扑、水密检测和一致的法线），实验证明其高效性和几何完整性。

Conclusion: Mesh Silksong在网格生成和几何特性方面表现出色，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: We introduce Mesh Silksong, a compact and efficient mesh representation
tailored to generate the polygon mesh in an auto-regressive manner akin to silk
weaving. Existing mesh tokenization methods always produce token sequences with
repeated vertex tokens, wasting the network capability. Therefore, our approach
tokenizes mesh vertices by accessing each mesh vertice only once, reduces the
token sequence's redundancy by 50\%, and achieves a state-of-the-art
compression rate of approximately 22\%. Furthermore, Mesh Silksong produces
polygon meshes with superior geometric properties, including manifold topology,
watertight detection, and consistent face normals, which are critical for
practical applications. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach, showcasing not only intricate mesh generation but also
significantly improved geometric integrity.

### [4] [ESTR-CoT: Towards Explainable and Accurate Event Stream based Scene Text Recognition with Chain-of-Thought Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02200)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于事件流的场景文本识别框架ESTR-CoT，通过链式思维推理增强模型的解释性和逻辑推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在极端场景（如低光照、快速运动）下表现不足，且缺乏解释性和逻辑推理能力。

Method: 采用EVA-CLIP编码事件流，结合Llama分词器和Vicuna-7B大语言模型，通过Q-former对齐视觉与语言特征，输出答案及推理过程。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上验证了框架的有效性和解释性。

Conclusion: ESTR-CoT在事件流场景文本识别中表现优异，并提供了大规模CoT数据集支持后续研究。

Abstract: Event stream based scene text recognition is a newly arising research topic
in recent years which performs better than the widely used RGB cameras in
extremely challenging scenarios, especially the low illumination, fast motion.
Existing works either adopt end-to-end encoder-decoder framework or large
language models for enhanced recognition, however, they are still limited by
the challenges of insufficient interpretability and weak contextual logical
reasoning. In this work, we propose a novel chain-of-thought reasoning based
event stream scene text recognition framework, termed ESTR-CoT. Specifically,
we first adopt the vision encoder EVA-CLIP (ViT-G/14) to transform the input
event stream into tokens and utilize a Llama tokenizer to encode the given
generation prompt. A Q-former is used to align the vision token to the
pre-trained large language model Vicuna-7B and output both the answer and
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning process simultaneously. Our framework can be
optimized using supervised fine-tuning in an end-to-end manner. In addition, we
also propose a large-scale CoT dataset to train our framework via a three stage
processing (i.e., generation, polish, and expert verification). This dataset
provides a solid data foundation for the development of subsequent
reasoning-based large models. Extensive experiments on three event stream STR
benchmark datasets (i.e., EventSTR, WordArt*, IC15*) fully validated the
effectiveness and interpretability of our proposed framework. The source code
and pre-trained models will be released on
https://github.com/Event-AHU/ESTR-CoT.

### [5] [HyperGaussians: High-Dimensional Gaussian Splatting for High-Fidelity Animatable Face Avatars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02803)
*Gent Serifi,Marcel C. Bühler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyperGaussians扩展了3D高斯泼溅技术，用于高质量可动画化面部虚拟形象，解决了非线性变形和复杂光照的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D高斯泼溅技术在可动画化面部虚拟形象中表现不佳，尤其是在非线性变形和复杂光照下。

Method: 提出HyperGaussians，通过高维多变量高斯分布和局部嵌入提升表达能力，并引入逆协方差技巧提高计算效率。

Result: 在4个面部数据集上的19名受试者中，HyperGaussians在数值和视觉上优于3D高斯泼溅技术。

Conclusion: HyperGaussians显著提升了可动画化面部虚拟形象的质量，尤其在细节和动态表现上。

Abstract: We introduce HyperGaussians, a novel extension of 3D Gaussian Splatting for
high-quality animatable face avatars. Creating such detailed face avatars from
videos is a challenging problem and has numerous applications in augmented and
virtual reality. While tremendous successes have been achieved for static
faces, animatable avatars from monocular videos still fall in the uncanny
valley. The de facto standard, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), represents a face
through a collection of 3D Gaussian primitives. 3DGS excels at rendering static
faces, but the state-of-the-art still struggles with nonlinear deformations,
complex lighting effects, and fine details. While most related works focus on
predicting better Gaussian parameters from expression codes, we rethink the 3D
Gaussian representation itself and how to make it more expressive. Our insights
lead to a novel extension of 3D Gaussians to high-dimensional multivariate
Gaussians, dubbed 'HyperGaussians'. The higher dimensionality increases
expressivity through conditioning on a learnable local embedding. However,
splatting HyperGaussians is computationally expensive because it requires
inverting a high-dimensional covariance matrix. We solve this by
reparameterizing the covariance matrix, dubbed the 'inverse covariance trick'.
This trick boosts the efficiency so that HyperGaussians can be seamlessly
integrated into existing models. To demonstrate this, we plug in HyperGaussians
into the state-of-the-art in fast monocular face avatars: FlashAvatar. Our
evaluation on 19 subjects from 4 face datasets shows that HyperGaussians
outperform 3DGS numerically and visually, particularly for high-frequency
details like eyeglass frames, teeth, complex facial movements, and specular
reflections.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种零样本多模态方法，用于复合表情识别（CER），结合六种模态并通过动态加权和概率聚合生成可解释的输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖特定任务的训练数据，而本研究旨在通过零样本组件实现无需域适应的复合情绪识别。

Method: 采用CLIP和Qwen-VL等零样本组件，结合多模态动态加权（MHPF）和概率聚合（PPA/PFSA）模块。

Result: 在AffWild2、AFEW和C-EXPR-DB数据集上的F1分数分别为46.95%、49.02%和34.85%，与监督方法相当。

Conclusion: 该方法无需域适应即可有效捕捉复合情绪，代码已开源。

Abstract: Compound Expression Recognition (CER), a subfield of affective computing,
aims to detect complex emotional states formed by combinations of basic
emotions. In this work, we present a novel zero-shot multimodal approach for
CER that combines six heterogeneous modalities into a single pipeline: static
and dynamic facial expressions, scene and label matching, scene context, audio,
and text. Unlike previous approaches relying on task-specific training data,
our approach uses zero-shot components, including Contrastive Language-Image
Pretraining (CLIP)-based label matching and Qwen-VL for semantic scene
understanding. We further introduce a Multi-Head Probability Fusion (MHPF)
module that dynamically weights modality-specific predictions, followed by a
Compound Expressions (CE) transformation module that uses Pair-Wise Probability
Aggregation (PPA) and Pair-Wise Feature Similarity Aggregation (PFSA) methods
to produce interpretable compound emotion outputs. Evaluated under multi-corpus
training, the proposed approach shows F1 scores of 46.95% on AffWild2, 49.02%
on Acted Facial Expressions in The Wild (AFEW), and 34.85% on C-EXPR-DB via
zero-shot testing, which is comparable to the results of supervised approaches
trained on target data. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed
approach for capturing CE without domain adaptation. The source code is
publicly available.

### [7] [LiteReality: Graphics-Ready 3D Scene Reconstruction from RGB-D Scans](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02861)
*Zhening Huang,Xiaoyang Wu,Fangcheng Zhong,Hengshuang Zhao,Matthias Nießner,Joan Lasenby*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LiteReality是一个将RGB-D扫描转换为紧凑、逼真且交互式3D虚拟副本的新流程，支持高质量渲染和物理交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将真实室内环境快速转换为可编辑、逼真的3D虚拟场景，适用于AR/VR、游戏、机器人等领域。

Method: 通过场景理解、3D模型检索、材质增强和物理引擎集成，构建紧凑且兼容标准图形管线的场景。

Result: 在Scan2CAD基准测试中实现最先进的相似性性能，并能处理严重的错位、遮挡和光照问题。

Conclusion: LiteReality在真实扫描和公共数据集上表现优异，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: We propose LiteReality, a novel pipeline that converts RGB-D scans of indoor
environments into compact, realistic, and interactive 3D virtual replicas.
LiteReality not only reconstructs scenes that visually resemble reality but
also supports key features essential for graphics pipelines -- such as object
individuality, articulation, high-quality physically based rendering materials,
and physically based interaction. At its core, LiteReality first performs scene
understanding and parses the results into a coherent 3D layout and objects with
the help of a structured scene graph. It then reconstructs the scene by
retrieving the most visually similar 3D artist-crafted models from a curated
asset database. Next, the Material Painting module enhances realism by
recovering high-quality, spatially varying materials. Finally, the
reconstructed scene is integrated into a simulation engine with basic physical
properties to enable interactive behavior. The resulting scenes are compact,
editable, and fully compatible with standard graphics pipelines, making them
suitable for applications in AR/VR, gaming, robotics, and digital twins. In
addition, LiteReality introduces a training-free object retrieval module that
achieves state-of-the-art similarity performance on the Scan2CAD benchmark,
along with a robust material painting module capable of transferring
appearances from images of any style to 3D assets -- even under severe
misalignment, occlusion, and poor lighting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
LiteReality on both real-life scans and public datasets. Project page:

### [8] [SciGA: A Comprehensive Dataset for Designing Graphical Abstracts in Academic Papers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02212)
*Takuro Kawada,Shunsuke Kitada,Sota Nemoto,Hitoshi Iyatomi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文介绍了SciGA-145k数据集，用于支持图形摘要（GA）的选择和推荐，并提出了两种任务和新的评估指标CAR。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图形摘要在科学传播中具有重要作用，但目前其潜力未被充分挖掘，且设计GA需要高级可视化技能，阻碍了其广泛应用。

Method: 提出了SciGA-145k数据集，包含14.5万篇论文和114万张图，并定义了两个任务（Intra-GA和Inter-GA推荐）及新评估指标CAR。

Result: 提供了基线模型和CAR指标，解决了传统排名指标的局限性。

Conclusion: SciGA-145k为视觉科学传播和AI在科学中的应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Graphical Abstracts (GAs) play a crucial role in visually conveying the key
findings of scientific papers. While recent research has increasingly
incorporated visual materials such as Figure 1 as de facto GAs, their potential
to enhance scientific communication remains largely unexplored. Moreover,
designing effective GAs requires advanced visualization skills, creating a
barrier to their widespread adoption. To tackle these challenges, we introduce
SciGA-145k, a large-scale dataset comprising approximately 145,000 scientific
papers and 1.14 million figures, explicitly designed for supporting GA
selection and recommendation as well as facilitating research in automated GA
generation. As a preliminary step toward GA design support, we define two
tasks: 1) Intra-GA recommendation, which identifies figures within a given
paper that are well-suited to serve as GAs, and 2) Inter-GA recommendation,
which retrieves GAs from other papers to inspire the creation of new GAs. We
provide reasonable baseline models for these tasks. Furthermore, we propose
Confidence Adjusted top-1 ground truth Ratio (CAR), a novel recommendation
metric that offers a fine-grained analysis of model behavior. CAR addresses
limitations in traditional ranking-based metrics by considering cases where
multiple figures within a paper, beyond the explicitly labeled GA, may also
serve as GAs. By unifying these tasks and metrics, our SciGA-145k establishes a
foundation for advancing visual scientific communication while contributing to
the development of AI for Science.

### [9] [Understanding Trade offs When Conditioning Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02217)
*Brandon Trabucco,Qasim Wani,Benjamin Pikus,Vasu Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文研究了在少量图像数据下如何利用扩散模型生成高质量合成数据以提升目标检测性能，比较了基于提示和基于布局的两种条件策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业视觉系统中高质量训练数据收集耗时，合成数据成为关键解决方案，但现有方法生成速度慢且模拟与现实差距大。

Method: 研究了80种视觉概念，比较了基于提示和基于布局的两种条件策略对合成数据质量的影响。

Result: 当布局条件与完整训练分布匹配时，合成数据使平均精度提升34%，最高可达177%。

Conclusion: 布局条件策略在多样性高时优于提示条件，能显著提升目标检测性能。

Abstract: Learning robust object detectors from only a handful of images is a critical
challenge in industrial vision systems, where collecting high quality training
data can take months. Synthetic data has emerged as a key solution for data
efficient visual inspection and pick and place robotics. Current pipelines rely
on 3D engines such as Blender or Unreal, which offer fine control but still
require weeks to render a small dataset, and the resulting images often suffer
from a large gap between simulation and reality. Diffusion models promise a
step change because they can generate high quality images in minutes, yet
precise control, especially in low data regimes, remains difficult. Although
many adapters now extend diffusion beyond plain text prompts, the effect of
different conditioning schemes on synthetic data quality is poorly understood.
We study eighty diverse visual concepts drawn from four standard object
detection benchmarks and compare two conditioning strategies: prompt based and
layout based. When the set of conditioning cues is narrow, prompt conditioning
yields higher quality synthetic data; as diversity grows, layout conditioning
becomes superior. When layout cues match the full training distribution,
synthetic data raises mean average precision by an average of thirty four
percent and by as much as one hundred seventy seven percent compared with using
real data alone.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种双向域适应（BiDA）框架，用于跨域高光谱图像分类，通过提取域不变特征和域特定信息，提升目标场景的适应性和可分性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决跨域高光谱图像分类中因光谱偏移导致的性能下降问题。

Result: 在跨时空数据集上表现优于现有方法，树种类分类任务中性能提升3%~5%。

Conclusion: BiDA框架有效提升了跨域高光谱图像分类的性能，尤其在噪声条件下表现优异。

Abstract: Utilizing hyperspectral remote sensing technology enables the extraction of
fine-grained land cover classes. Typically, satellite or airborne images used
for training and testing are acquired from different regions or times, where
the same class has significant spectral shifts in different scenes. In this
paper, we propose a Bi-directional Domain Adaptation (BiDA) framework for
cross-domain hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, which focuses on
extracting both domain-invariant features and domain-specific information in
the independent adaptive space, thereby enhancing the adaptability and
separability to the target scene. In the proposed BiDA, a triple-branch
transformer architecture (the source branch, target branch, and coupled branch)
with semantic tokenizer is designed as the backbone. Specifically, the source
branch and target branch independently learn the adaptive space of source and
target domains, a Coupled Multi-head Cross-attention (CMCA) mechanism is
developed in coupled branch for feature interaction and inter-domain
correlation mining. Furthermore, a bi-directional distillation loss is designed
to guide adaptive space learning using inter-domain correlation. Finally, we
propose an Adaptive Reinforcement Strategy (ARS) to encourage the model to
focus on specific generalized feature extraction within both source and target
scenes in noise condition. Experimental results on cross-temporal/scene
airborne and satellite datasets demonstrate that the proposed BiDA performs
significantly better than some state-of-the-art domain adaptation approaches.
In the cross-temporal tree species classification task, the proposed BiDA is
more than 3\%$\sim$5\% higher than the most advanced method. The codes will be
available from the website:

### [11] [High-Fidelity Differential-information Driven Binary Vision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02222)
*Tian Gao,Zhiyuan Zhang,Kaijie Yin,Xu-Cheng Zhong,Hui Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DIDB-ViT是一种新型的二进制视觉变换器，通过引入差分信息和高频保留技术，显著提升了性能，同时保持了计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有二进制ViT方法性能下降严重或依赖全精度模块的问题。

Method: 设计了一个包含差分信息的注意力模块，使用离散Haar小波进行频率分解，并改进了RPReLU激活函数。

Result: 在多种ViT架构中，DIDB-ViT显著优于现有网络量化方法，图像分类和分割性能优越。

Conclusion: DIDB-ViT在保持计算效率的同时，有效提升了二进制ViT的性能。

Abstract: The binarization of vision transformers (ViTs) offers a promising approach to
addressing the trade-off between high computational/storage demands and the
constraints of edge-device deployment. However, existing binary ViT methods
often suffer from severe performance degradation or rely heavily on
full-precision modules. To address these issues, we propose DIDB-ViT, a novel
binary ViT that is highly informative while maintaining the original ViT
architecture and computational efficiency. Specifically, we design an
informative attention module incorporating differential information to mitigate
information loss caused by binarization and enhance high-frequency retention.
To preserve the fidelity of the similarity calculations between binary Q and K
tensors, we apply frequency decomposition using the discrete Haar wavelet and
integrate similarities across different frequencies. Additionally, we introduce
an improved RPReLU activation function to restructure the activation
distribution, expanding the model's representational capacity. Experimental
results demonstrate that our DIDB-ViT significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art network quantization methods in multiple ViT architectures,
achieving superior image classification and segmentation performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型深度学习架构，通过集成残差U-Net模型和元模型，显著提高了结构裂缝检测的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动检测结构裂缝存在效率低、一致性差和人为错误的问题，需要更可靠的自动化方法。

Method: 研究使用残差U-Net模型，并将其集成到包含卷积块的元模型中，形成集成模型。

Result: 集成模型在IoU和DICE系数上表现最佳，超越了SegNet和传统U-Net。

Conclusion: 该研究为结构缺陷监测任务提供了更可靠的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Structural crack detection is a critical task for public safety as it helps
in preventing potential structural failures that could endanger lives. Manual
detection by inexperienced personnel can be slow, inconsistent, and prone to
human error, which may compromise the reliability of assessments. The current
study addresses these challenges by introducing a novel deep-learning
architecture designed to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of structural
crack detection. In this research, various configurations of residual U-Net
models were utilized. These models, due to their robustness in capturing fine
details, were further integrated into an ensemble with a meta-model comprising
convolutional blocks. This unique combination aimed to boost prediction
efficiency beyond what individual models could achieve. The ensemble's
performance was evaluated against well-established architectures such as SegNet
and the traditional U-Net. Results demonstrated that the residual U-Net models
outperformed their predecessors, particularly with low-resolution imagery, and
the ensemble model exceeded the performance of individual models, proving it as
the most effective. The assessment was based on the Intersection over Union
(IoU) metric and DICE coefficient. The ensemble model achieved the highest
scores, signifying superior accuracy. This advancement suggests way for more
reliable automated systems in structural defects monitoring tasks.

TL;DR: FMOcc提出了一种基于流匹配选择性状态空间模型的TPV细化占用网络，用于少帧3D占用预测，显著提升了预测精度和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决少帧图像和3D空间冗余导致的遮挡和远距离场景预测精度不足的问题，同时避免现有方法需要额外数据和计算资源的问题。

Method: 设计了流匹配SSM模块（FMSSM）生成缺失特征；通过TPV SSM层和平面选择性SSM（PS3M）选择性过滤TPV特征；采用掩码训练（MT）增强鲁棒性。

Result: 在Occ3D-nuScenes和OpenOcc数据集上表现优异，两帧输入下达到43.1% RayIoU和39.8% mIoU，推理内存5.4G，时间330ms。

Conclusion: FMOcc通过流匹配和选择性特征过滤，显著提升了少帧3D占用预测的性能和效率。

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction plays a pivotal role in autonomous driving.
However, inherent limitations of fewframe images and redundancy in 3D space
compromise prediction accuracy for occluded and distant scenes. Existing
methods enhance performance by fusing historical frame data, which need
additional data and significant computational resources. To address these
issues, this paper propose FMOcc, a Tri-perspective View (TPV) refinement
occupancy network with flow matching selective state space model for few-frame
3D occupancy prediction. Firstly, to generate missing features, we designed a
feature refinement module based on a flow matching model, which is called Flow
Matching SSM module (FMSSM). Furthermore, by designing the TPV SSM layer and
Plane Selective SSM (PS3M), we selectively filter TPV features to reduce the
impact of air voxels on non-air voxels, thereby enhancing the overall
efficiency of the model and prediction capability for distant scenes. Finally,
we design the Mask Training (MT) method to enhance the robustness of FMOcc and
address the issue of sensor data loss. Experimental results on the
Occ3D-nuScenes and OpenOcc datasets show that our FMOcc outperforms existing
state-of-theart methods. Our FMOcc with two frame input achieves notable scores
of 43.1% RayIoU and 39.8% mIoU on Occ3D-nuScenes validation, 42.6% RayIoU on
OpenOcc with 5.4 G inference memory and 330ms inference time.

*Zeyu Lei,Hongyuan Yu,Jinlin Wu,Zhen Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SurgVisAgent，基于多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的智能手术视觉代理，动态识别内窥镜图像中的失真类别和严重程度，支持多种增强任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有算法通常针对单一任务设计，难以应对复杂手术场景的多样化需求。

Method: 结合先验模型提供领域知识，通过上下文少样本学习和思维链推理实现定制化图像增强。

Result: 在模拟真实手术失真的基准测试中，SurgVisAgent表现优于传统单任务模型。

Conclusion: SurgVisAgent有望成为手术辅助的统一解决方案。

Abstract: Precise surgical interventions are vital to patient safety, and advanced
enhancement algorithms have been developed to assist surgeons in
decision-making. Despite significant progress, these algorithms are typically
designed for single tasks in specific scenarios, limiting their effectiveness
in complex real-world situations. To address this limitation, we propose
SurgVisAgent, an end-to-end intelligent surgical vision agent built on
multimodal large language models (MLLMs). SurgVisAgent dynamically identifies
distortion categories and severity levels in endoscopic images, enabling it to
perform a variety of enhancement tasks such as low-light enhancement,
overexposure correction, motion blur elimination, and smoke removal.
Specifically, to achieve superior surgical scenario understanding, we design a
prior model that provides domain-specific knowledge. Additionally, through
in-context few-shot learning and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, SurgVisAgent
delivers customized image enhancements tailored to a wide range of distortion
types and severity levels, thereby addressing the diverse requirements of
surgeons. Furthermore, we construct a comprehensive benchmark simulating
real-world surgical distortions, on which extensive experiments demonstrate
that SurgVisAgent surpasses traditional single-task models, highlighting its

*Wei Li,Jingyang Zhang,Lihao Liu,Guoan Wang,Junjun He,Yang Chen,Lixu Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自由形式测试时间适应（F²TTA）任务，针对医学领域中数据以任意长度和随机顺序到达的场景，提出了图像级解耦提示调优（I-DiPT）框架，通过不确定性导向掩码（UoM）和平行图蒸馏（PGD）方法提升模型适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于医学数据标注成本高且数据通常以不规则的域片段形式到达，现有TTA方法无法有效处理这种自由形式的数据流。

Method: 提出了I-DiPT框架，包含图像不变提示和图像特定提示，结合UoM和PGD方法优化知识提取和历史知识重用。

Result: 在乳腺癌和青光眼分类任务中，该方法优于现有TTA方法。

Conclusion: I-DiPT框架有效解决了自由形式数据流中的适应问题，为医学领域的TTA提供了新思路。

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) has emerged as a promising solution for adapting a
source model to unseen medical sites using unlabeled test data, due to the high
cost of data annotation. Existing TTA methods consider scenarios where data
from one or multiple domains arrives in complete domain units. However, in
clinical practice, data usually arrives in domain fragments of arbitrary
lengths and in random arrival orders, due to resource constraints and patient
variability. This paper investigates a practical Free-Form Test-Time Adaptation
(F$^{2}$TTA) task, where a source model is adapted to such free-form domain
fragments, with shifts occurring between fragments unpredictably. In this
setting, these shifts could distort the adaptation process. To address this
problem, we propose a novel Image-level Disentangled Prompt Tuning (I-DiPT)
framework. I-DiPT employs an image-invariant prompt to explore domain-invariant
representations for mitigating the unpredictable shifts, and an image-specific
prompt to adapt the source model to each test image from the incoming
fragments. The prompts may suffer from insufficient knowledge representation
since only one image is available for training. To overcome this limitation, we
first introduce Uncertainty-oriented Masking (UoM), which encourages the
prompts to extract sufficient information from the incoming image via masked
consistency learning driven by the uncertainty of the source model
representations. Then, we further propose a Parallel Graph Distillation (PGD)
method that reuses knowledge from historical image-specific and image-invariant
prompts through parallel graph networks. Experiments on breast cancer and
glaucoma classification demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing
TTA approaches in F$^{2}$TTA. Code is available at

Method: 集成ResNet的特征提取模块和类特定注意力机制，实现多标签分类。

Result: 在Rescuenet数据集上达到90.23%的平均精度，优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架提升了飓风后损害评估的准确性和效率，有助于未来灾害缓解和恢复策略。

Abstract: Hurricanes cause widespread destruction, resulting in diverse damage types
and severities that require timely and accurate assessment for effective
disaster response. While traditional single-label classification methods fall
short of capturing the complexity of post-hurricane damage, this study
introduces a novel multi-label classification framework for assessing damage
using aerial imagery. The proposed approach integrates a feature extraction
module based on ResNet and a class-specific attention mechanism to identify
multiple damage types within a single image. Using the Rescuenet dataset from
Hurricane Michael, the proposed method achieves a mean average precision of
90.23%, outperforming existing baseline methods. This framework enhances
post-hurricane damage assessment, enabling more targeted and efficient disaster
response and contributing to future strategies for disaster mitigation and
resilience. This paper has been accepted at the ASCE International Conference
on Computing in Civil Engineering (i3CE 2025), and the camera-ready version
will appear in the official conference proceedings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IGDNet是一种零样本增强方法，无需配对数据或先验知识，通过分解和去噪模块恢复低曝光图像，避免过增强问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖配对数据且可能导致过增强，实际中数据收集困难。

Method: IGDNet通过分解模块分离图像为光照和反射分量，去噪模块利用光照引导的像素自适应校正增强非均匀光照区域。

Result: 在四个公开数据集上表现优异，PSNR（20.41dB）和SSIM（0.860dB）优于14种无监督方法。

Conclusion: IGDNet在复杂光照条件下显著提升视觉质量，具有强泛化能力。

Abstract: Current methods for restoring underexposed images typically rely on
supervised learning with paired underexposed and well-illuminated images.
However, collecting such datasets is often impractical in real-world scenarios.
Moreover, these methods can lead to over-enhancement, distorting
well-illuminated regions. To address these issues, we propose IGDNet, a
Zero-Shot enhancement method that operates solely on a single test image,
without requiring guiding priors or training data. IGDNet exhibits strong
generalization ability and effectively suppresses noise while restoring
illumination. The framework comprises a decomposition module and a denoising
module. The former separates the image into illumination and reflection
components via a dense connection network, while the latter enhances
non-uniformly illuminated regions using an illumination-guided pixel adaptive
correction method. A noise pair is generated through downsampling and refined
iteratively to produce the final result. Extensive experiments on four public
datasets demonstrate that IGDNet significantly improves visual quality under
complex lighting conditions. Quantitative results on metrics like PSNR
(20.41dB) and SSIM (0.860dB) show that it outperforms 14 state-of-the-art
unsupervised methods. The code will be released soon.

Abstract: Enhancing underwater images is crucial for exploration. These images face
visibility and color issues due to light changes, water turbidity, and bubbles.
Traditional prior-based methods and pixel-based methods often fail, while deep
learning lacks sufficient high-quality datasets. We introduce the Multi-Axis
Conditional Lookup (MAC-Lookup) model, which enhances visual quality by
improving color accuracy, sharpness, and contrast. It includes Conditional 3D
Lookup Table Color Correction (CLTCC) for preliminary color and quality
correction and Multi-Axis Adaptive Enhancement (MAAE) for detail refinement.
This model prevents over-enhancement and saturation while handling underwater
challenges. Extensive experiments show that MAC-Lookup excels in enhancing
underwater images by restoring details and colors better than existing methods.

Motivation: 当前视频到音频生成方法忽视了电影语言这一关键艺术表达元素，导致在部分可见目标场景中性能下降。

Method: 采用自蒸馏方法，通过模拟电影语言变化，使学生模型学习对齐视频特征与音频-视觉对应关系。

Result: 在部分可见场景中显著提升性能，同时在大规模V2A数据集VGGSound上也表现更优。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了部分可见目标场景中的性能问题，并提升了整体生成质量。

Abstract: Video-to-Audio (V2A) Generation achieves significant progress and plays a
crucial role in film and video post-production. However, current methods
overlook the cinematic language, a critical component of artistic expression in
filmmaking. As a result, their performance deteriorates in scenarios where
Foley targets are only partially visible. To address this challenge, we propose
a simple self-distillation approach to extend V2A models to cinematic language
scenarios. By simulating the cinematic language variations, the student model
learns to align the video features of training pairs with the same audio-visual
correspondences, enabling it to effectively capture the associations between
sounds and partial visual information. Our method not only achieves impressive
improvements under partial visibility across all evaluation metrics, but also
enhances performance on the large-scale V2A dataset, VGGSound.

Result: LaCo在中间层压缩中优于现有方法，训练效率提升20%以上，推理吞吐量提升15%。

Conclusion: LaCo在保持性能的同时显著提升了效率，为视觉令牌压缩提供了新思路。

Abstract: Existing visual token compression methods for Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) predominantly operate as post-encoder modules, limiting their
potential for efficiency gains. To address this limitation, we propose LaCo
(Layer-wise Visual Token Compression), a novel framework that enables effective
token compression within the intermediate layers of the vision encoder. LaCo
introduces two core components: 1) a layer-wise pixel-shuffle mechanism that
systematically merges adjacent tokens through space-to-channel transformations,
and 2) a residual learning architecture with non-parametric shortcuts that
preserves critical visual information during compression. Extensive experiments
indicate that our LaCo outperforms all existing methods when compressing tokens
in the intermediate layers of the vision encoder, demonstrating superior
effectiveness. In addition, compared to external compression, our method
improves training efficiency beyond 20% and inference throughput over 15% while
maintaining strong performance.

Motivation: 解决域泛化中如何设计能够解耦跨域不变特征的提示的挑战。

Method: 利用VFM的可控语言提示，通过LLM解耦文本提示，并引入WERA增强视觉表示。

Result: 在多个DG数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 结合语言和视觉引导的方法有效提升了域泛化性能。

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) seeks to develop a versatile model capable of
performing effectively on unseen target domains. Notably, recent advances in
pre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
considerable potential in enhancing the generalization capabilities of deep
learning models. Despite the increasing attention toward VFM-based domain
prompt tuning within DG, the effective design of prompts capable of
disentangling invariant features across diverse domains remains a critical
challenge. In this paper, we propose addressing this challenge by leveraging
the controllable and flexible language prompt of the VFM. Noting that the text
modality of VFMs is naturally easier to disentangle, we introduce a novel
framework for text feature-guided visual prompt tuning. This framework first
automatically disentangles the text prompt using a large language model (LLM)
and then learns domain-invariant visual representation guided by the
disentangled text feature. However, relying solely on language to guide visual
feature disentanglement has limitations, as visual features can sometimes be
too complex or nuanced to be fully captured by descriptive text. To address
this, we introduce Worst Explicit Representation Alignment (WERA), which
extends text-guided visual prompts by incorporating an additional set of
abstract prompts. These prompts enhance source domain diversity through
stylized image augmentations, while alignment constraints ensure that visual
representations remain consistent across both the original and augmented
distributions. Experiments conducted on major DG datasets, including PACS,
VLCS, OfficeHome, DomainNet, and TerraInc, demonstrate that our proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art DG methods.

Motivation: 解决SAM在遥感图像分割中手动提示效率低和缺乏领域适应性的问题。

Method: 提出ViRefSAM框架，包含视觉上下文提示编码器和动态目标对齐适配器，利用少量参考图像生成自动提示并适应遥感领域。

Result: 在iSAID-5$^i$、LoveDA-2$^i$和COCO-20$^i$等数据集上表现优于现有少样本分割方法。

Conclusion: ViRefSAM通过少量参考图像实现高效自动分割，显著提升SAM在遥感领域的适用性。

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM), with its prompt-driven paradigm, exhibits
strong generalization in generic segmentation tasks. However, applying SAM to
remote sensing (RS) images still faces two major challenges. First, manually
constructing precise prompts for each image (e.g., points or boxes) is
labor-intensive and inefficient, especially in RS scenarios with dense small
objects or spatially fragmented distributions. Second, SAM lacks domain
adaptability, as it is pre-trained primarily on natural images and struggles to
capture RS-specific semantics and spatial characteristics, especially when
segmenting novel or unseen classes. To address these issues, inspired by
few-shot learning, we propose ViRefSAM, a novel framework that guides SAM
utilizing only a few annotated reference images that contain class-specific
objects. Without requiring manual prompts, ViRefSAM enables automatic
segmentation of class-consistent objects across RS images. Specifically,
ViRefSAM introduces two key components while keeping SAM's original
architecture intact: (1) a Visual Contextual Prompt Encoder that extracts
class-specific semantic clues from reference images and generates object-aware
prompts via contextual interaction with target images; and (2) a Dynamic Target
Alignment Adapter, integrated into SAM's image encoder, which mitigates the
domain gap by injecting class-specific semantics into target image features,
enabling SAM to dynamically focus on task-relevant regions. Extensive
experiments on three few-shot segmentation benchmarks, including iSAID-5$^i$,
LoveDA-2$^i$, and COCO-20$^i$, demonstrate that ViRefSAM enables accurate and
automatic segmentation of unseen classes by leveraging only a few reference
images and consistently outperforms existing few-shot segmentation methods
across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Recent advancements in leveraging pre-trained 2D diffusion models achieve the
generation of high-quality novel views from a single in-the-wild image.
However, existing works face challenges in producing controllable novel views
due to the lack of information from multiple views. In this paper, we present
DreamComposer++, a flexible and scalable framework designed to improve current
view-aware diffusion models by incorporating multi-view conditions.
Specifically, DreamComposer++ utilizes a view-aware 3D lifting module to
extract 3D representations of an object from various views. These
representations are then aggregated and rendered into the latent features of
target view through the multi-view feature fusion module. Finally, the obtained
features of target view are integrated into pre-trained image or video
diffusion models for novel view synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate
that DreamComposer++ seamlessly integrates with cutting-edge view-aware
diffusion models and enhances their abilities to generate controllable novel
views from multi-view conditions. This advancement facilitates controllable 3D
object reconstruction and enables a wide range of applications.

Conclusion: Flow-CDNet通过双分支结构有效解决了同时检测慢速和快速变化的挑战，为变化检测任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Change detection typically involves identifying regions with changes between
bitemporal images taken at the same location. Besides significant changes, slow
changes in bitemporal images are also important in real-life scenarios. For
instance, weak changes often serve as precursors to major hazards in scenarios
like slopes, dams, and tailings ponds. Therefore, designing a change detection
network that simultaneously detects slow and fast changes presents a novel
challenge. In this paper, to address this challenge, we propose a change
detection network named Flow-CDNet, consisting of two branches: optical flow
branch and binary change detection branch. The first branch utilizes a pyramid
structure to extract displacement changes at multiple scales. The second one
combines a ResNet-based network with the optical flow branch's output to
generate fast change outputs. Subsequently, to supervise and evaluate this new
change detection framework, a self-built change detection dataset Flow-Change,
a loss function combining binary tversky loss and L2 norm loss, along with a
new evaluation metric called FEPE are designed. Quantitative experiments
conducted on Flow-Change dataset demonstrated that our approach outperforms the
existing methods. Furthermore, ablation experiments verified that the two
branches can promote each other to enhance the detection performance.

Conclusion: LMPNet通过直接操作网络滤波器检测预定义概念，具有高可解释性和高效性。

Abstract: In this work, we explore the task of semantic object keypoint discovery
weakly-supervised by only category labels. This is achieved by transforming
discriminatively-trained intermediate layer filters into keypoint detectors. We
begin by identifying three preferred characteristics of keypoint detectors: (i)
spatially sparse activations, (ii) consistency and (iii) diversity. Instead of
relying on hand-crafted loss terms, a novel computationally-efficient leaky max
pooling (LMP) layer is proposed to explicitly encourage final conv-layer
filters to learn "non-repeatable local patterns" that are well aligned with
object keypoints. Informed by visualizations, a simple yet effective selection
strategy is proposed to ensure consistent filter activations and attention
mask-out is then applied to force the network to distribute its attention to
the whole object instead of just the most discriminative region. For the final
keypoint prediction, a learnable clustering layer is proposed to group keypoint
proposals into keypoint predictions. The final model, named LMPNet, is highly
interpretable in that it directly manipulates network filters to detect
predefined concepts. Our experiments show that LMPNet can (i) automatically
discover semantic keypoints that are robust to object pose and (ii) achieves
strong prediction accuracy comparable to a supervised pose estimation model.

Conclusion: fMRI信号包含未被充分利用的语义和空间信息，未来模型可进一步整合这些信息以优化视觉解码。

Abstract: Recent advances in brain-vision decoding have driven significant progress,
reconstructing with high fidelity perceived visual stimuli from neural
activity, e.g., functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), in the human
visual cortex. Most existing methods decode the brain signal using a two-level
strategy, i.e., pixel-level and semantic-level. However, these methods rely
heavily on low-level pixel alignment yet lack sufficient and fine-grained
semantic alignment, resulting in obvious reconstruction distortions of multiple
semantic objects. To better understand the brain's visual perception patterns
and how current decoding models process semantic objects, we have developed an
experimental framework that uses fMRI representations as intervention
conditions. By injecting these representations into multi-scale image features
via cross-attention, we compare both downstream performance and intermediate
feature changes on object detection and instance segmentation tasks with and
without fMRI information. Our results demonstrate that incorporating fMRI
signals enhances the accuracy of downstream detection and segmentation,
confirming that fMRI contains rich multi-object semantic cues and coarse
spatial localization information-elements that current models have yet to fully
exploit or integrate.

Conclusion: MAGIC通过多级扰动和上下文对齐，实现了高质量的少样本异常生成，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly generation is emerging as a practical solution for
augmenting the scarce anomaly data in industrial quality control settings. An
ideal generator would meet three demands at once, namely (i) keep the normal
background intact, (ii) inpaint anomalous regions to tightly overlap with the
corresponding anomaly masks, and (iii) generate anomalous regions in a
semantically valid location, while still producing realistic, diverse
appearances from only a handful of real examples. Existing diffusion-based
methods usually satisfy at most two of these requirements: global anomaly
generators corrupt the background, whereas mask-guided ones often falter when
the mask is imprecise or misplaced. We propose MAGIC--Mask-guided inpainting
with multi-level perturbations and Context-aware alignment--to resolve all
three issues. At its core, MAGIC fine-tunes a Stable Diffusion inpainting
backbone that preserves normal regions and ensures strict adherence of the
synthesized anomaly to the supplied mask, directly addressing background
corruption and misalignment. To offset the diversity loss that fine-tuning can
cause, MAGIC adds two complementary perturbation strategies: (i) Gaussian
prompt-level perturbation applied during fine-tuning and inference that
broadens the global appearance of anomalies while avoiding low-fidelity textual
appearances, and (ii) mask-guided spatial noise injection that enriches local
texture variations. Additionally, the context-aware mask alignment module forms
semantic correspondences and relocates masks so that every anomaly remains
plausibly contained within the host object, eliminating out-of-boundary
artifacts. Under a consistent identical evaluation protocol on the MVTec-AD
dataset, MAGIC outperforms previous state-of-the-arts in downstream anomaly
tasks.

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) synthesis has advanced rapidly, yet current evaluation
metrics primarily capture visual quality and temporal consistency, offering
limited insight into how synthetic videos perform in downstream tasks such as
text-to-video retrieval (TVR). In this work, we introduce SynTVA, a new dataset
and benchmark designed to evaluate the utility of synthetic videos for building
retrieval models. Based on 800 diverse user queries derived from MSRVTT
training split, we generate synthetic videos using state-of-the-art T2V models
and annotate each video-text pair along four key semantic alignment dimensions:
Object \& Scene, Action, Attribute, and Prompt Fidelity. Our evaluation
framework correlates general video quality assessment (VQA) metrics with these
alignment scores, and examines their predictive power for downstream TVR
performance. To explore pathways of scaling up, we further develop an
Auto-Evaluator to estimate alignment quality from existing metrics. Beyond
benchmarking, our results show that SynTVA is a valuable asset for dataset
augmentation, enabling the selection of high-utility synthetic samples that
measurably improve TVR outcomes. Project page and dataset can be found at

TL;DR: InnerControl提出了一种新的训练策略，通过在扩散模型的所有步骤中强制空间一致性，提升了生成图像的空间控制精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如ControlNet++）仅关注最终去噪步骤的循环一致性，忽略了中间生成阶段，限制了其效果。

Method: 通过训练轻量级卷积探针，从中间UNet特征重建输入控制信号（如边缘、深度），并在整个扩散过程中最小化预测与目标条件之间的差异。

Result: InnerControl结合ControlNet++等技术，在多种条件方法（如边缘、深度）上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: InnerControl通过全步骤的空间一致性优化，显著提升了生成图像的控制保真度和质量。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in text-to-image diffusion models, achieving
precise spatial control over generated outputs remains challenging. ControlNet
addresses this by introducing an auxiliary conditioning module, while
ControlNet++ further refines alignment through a cycle consistency loss applied
only to the final denoising steps. However, this approach neglects intermediate
generation stages, limiting its effectiveness. We propose InnerControl, a
training strategy that enforces spatial consistency across all diffusion steps.
Our method trains lightweight convolutional probes to reconstruct input control
signals (e.g., edges, depth) from intermediate UNet features at every denoising
step. These probes efficiently extract signals even from highly noisy latents,
enabling pseudo ground truth controls for training. By minimizing the
discrepancy between predicted and target conditions throughout the entire
diffusion process, our alignment loss improves both control fidelity and
generation quality. Combined with established techniques like ControlNet++,
InnerControl achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse conditioning
methods (e.g., edges, depth).

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于人工神经网络（ANN）的图像处理技术，用于水稻叶病的早期分类与识别，比较了特征分析检测模型（FADM）和直接图像中心检测模型（DICDM）的性能，发现FADM表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水稻叶病严重影响产量和经济收益，早期检测对有效管理和提高产量至关重要。

Method: 研究采用特征提取算法（FEAs）、降维算法（DRAs）、特征选择算法（FSAs）和极限学习机（ELM）构建FADM，并与未使用FEA的DICDM进行对比，使用10折交叉验证评估性能。

Result: 实验结果表明，FADM在分类水稻叶病方面表现最佳。

Conclusion: FADM在提高作物健康、减少产量损失及增强水稻种植可持续性方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Rice leaf diseases significantly reduce productivity and cause economic
losses, highlighting the need for early detection to enable effective
management and improve yields. This study proposes Artificial Neural Network
(ANN)-based image-processing techniques for timely classification and
recognition of rice diseases. Despite the prevailing approach of directly
inputting images of rice leaves into ANNs, there is a noticeable absence of
thorough comparative analysis between the Feature Analysis Detection Model
(FADM) and Direct Image-Centric Detection Model (DICDM), specifically when it
comes to evaluating the effectiveness of Feature Extraction Algorithms (FEAs).
Hence, this research presents initial experiments on the Feature Analysis
Detection Model, utilizing various image Feature Extraction Algorithms,
Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms (DRAs), Feature Selection Algorithms
(FSAs), and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). The experiments are carried out on
datasets encompassing bacterial leaf blight, brown spot, leaf blast, leaf
scald, Sheath blight rot, and healthy leaf, utilizing 10-fold Cross-Validation
method. A Direct Image-Centric Detection Model is established without the
utilization of any FEA, and the evaluation of classification performance relies
on different metrics. Ultimately, an exhaustive contrast is performed between
the achievements of the Feature Analysis Detection Model and Direct
Image-Centric Detection Model in classifying rice leaf diseases. The results
reveal that the highest performance is attained using the Feature Analysis
Detection Model. The adoption of the proposed Feature Analysis Detection Model
for detecting rice leaf diseases holds excellent potential for improving crop
health, minimizing yield losses, and enhancing overall productivity and
sustainability of rice farming.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种两阶段神经网络方法，用于自动检测颅内动脉瘤（ICA）在Willis环（CoW）分叉处的关键标志点，提高了检测准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 颅内动脉瘤常见于Willis环的特定分叉处，准确检测这些标志点对快速诊断至关重要。

Method: 采用两阶段神经网络：首先用目标检测网络识别感兴趣区域（ROIs），再用改进的U-Net精确定位分叉点。

Result: 在两种脑MRA数据集上测试，该方法在分叉检测任务中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 两阶段方法有效解决了标志点邻近和视觉相似性问题，适应了Willis环的解剖变异性。

Abstract: Intracranial aneurysms (ICA) commonly occur in specific segments of the
Circle of Willis (CoW), primarily, onto thirteen major arterial bifurcations.
An accurate detection of these critical landmarks is necessary for a prompt and
efficient diagnosis. We introduce a fully automated landmark detection approach
for CoW bifurcations using a two-step neural networks process. Initially, an
object detection network identifies regions of interest (ROIs) proximal to the
landmark locations. Subsequently, a modified U-Net with deep supervision is
exploited to accurately locate the bifurcations. This two-step method reduces
various problems, such as the missed detections caused by two landmarks being
close to each other and having similar visual characteristics, especially when
processing the complete MRA Time-of-Flight (TOF). Additionally, it accounts for
the anatomical variability of the CoW, which affects the number of detectable
landmarks per scan. We assessed the effectiveness of our approach using two
cerebral MRA datasets: our In-House dataset which had varying numbers of
landmarks, and a public dataset with standardized landmark configuration. Our
experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves the highest level of
performance on a bifurcation detection task.

Abstract: Shrimp diseases are one of the primary causes of economic losses in shrimp
aquaculture. To prevent disease transmission and enhance intelligent detection
efficiency in shrimp farming, this paper proposes a lightweight network

TL;DR: Hita是一种新型的自回归图像生成标记器，通过全局到局部的标记化方案和关键策略改进生成过程，显著提升了训练速度和生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统自回归模型在生成图像时难以捕捉全局关系的问题，以及传统标记器缺乏全局信息的局限性。

Method: 引入全局查询和局部补丁标记的标记化方案，采用因果注意力和轻量级融合模块优化信息流。

Result: 在ImageNet基准测试中达到2.59 FID和281.9 IS，并在零样本风格迁移和图像修复中表现优异。

Conclusion: Hita通过全局表示显著提升了自回归图像生成的性能，适用于多种图像任务。

Abstract: The vanilla autoregressive image generation model generates visual tokens in
a step-by-step fashion, which limits the ability to capture holistic
relationships among token sequences. Moreover, most visual tokenizers map local
image patches into latent tokens, leading to limited global information. To
address this, we introduce \textit{Hita}, a novel image tokenizer for
autoregressive (AR) image generation. It introduces a holistic-to-local
tokenization scheme with learnable holistic queries and local patch tokens.
Besides, Hita incorporates two key strategies for improved alignment with the
AR generation process: 1) it arranges a sequential structure with holistic
tokens at the beginning followed by patch-level tokens while using causal
attention to maintain awareness of previous tokens; and 2) before feeding the
de-quantized tokens into the decoder, Hita adopts a lightweight fusion module
to control information flow to prioritize holistic tokens. Extensive
experiments show that Hita accelerates the training speed of AR generators and
outperforms those trained with vanilla tokenizers, achieving \textbf{2.59 FID}
and \textbf{281.9 IS} on the ImageNet benchmark. A detailed analysis of the
holistic representation highlights its ability to capture global image
properties such as textures, materials, and shapes. Additionally, Hita also
demonstrates effectiveness in zero-shot style transfer and image in-painting.

TL;DR: LocalDyGS提出了一种动态场景重建框架，通过分解场景为局部空间并解耦静态与动态特征，实现了对大尺度和小尺度动态场景的建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中复杂且高度动态的运动使得从多视角输入合成任意视角的动态视频具有挑战性，现有方法局限于小尺度运动建模。

Method: 1) 将复杂动态场景分解为由种子定义的局部空间，实现全局建模；2) 解耦静态与动态特征，静态特征捕捉静态信息，动态残差场提供时间特定特征，生成时间高斯模型。

Result: 在多种小尺度数据集上表现优于现有方法，并首次尝试建模更大、更复杂的高度动态场景。

Conclusion: LocalDyGS为动态场景重建提供了更真实的建模方法，扩展了应用范围。

Abstract: Due to the complex and highly dynamic motions in the real world, synthesizing
dynamic videos from multi-view inputs for arbitrary viewpoints is challenging.
Previous works based on neural radiance field or 3D Gaussian splatting are
limited to modeling fine-scale motion, greatly restricting their application.
In this paper, we introduce LocalDyGS, which consists of two parts to adapt our
method to both large-scale and fine-scale motion scenes: 1) We decompose a
complex dynamic scene into streamlined local spaces defined by seeds, enabling
global modeling by capturing motion within each local space. 2) We decouple
static and dynamic features for local space motion modeling. A static feature
shared across time steps captures static information, while a dynamic residual
field provides time-specific features. These are combined and decoded to
generate Temporal Gaussians, modeling motion within each local space. As a
result, we propose a novel dynamic scene reconstruction framework to model
highly dynamic real-world scenes more realistically. Our method not only
demonstrates competitive performance on various fine-scale datasets compared to
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, but also represents the first attempt to model
larger and more complex highly dynamic scenes. Project page:

Motivation: 现有视频语言模型主要关注陆地场景，忽视了水下观测的高需求应用。UVLM旨在填补这一空白，提供高质量、多样化的水下数据集。

Method: 通过选择典型水下挑战的视频（如光线变化、水质浑浊、多视角），构建包含多种帧率、分辨率、海洋生物类别的数据集，并设计结构化任务类别（生物与环境）和20种任务类型。

Conclusion: UVLM为水下观测提供了高质量基准，展示了视频语言模型在水下场景的潜力，数据集和提示工程将公开。

Abstract: Recently, the remarkable success of large language models (LLMs) has achieved
a profound impact on the field of artificial intelligence. Numerous advanced
works based on LLMs have been proposed and applied in various scenarios. Among
them, video language models (VidLMs) are particularly widely used. However,
existing works primarily focus on terrestrial scenarios, overlooking the highly
demanding application needs of underwater observation. To overcome this gap, we
introduce UVLM, an under water observation benchmark which is build through a
collaborative approach combining human expertise and AI models. To ensure data
quality, we have conducted in-depth considerations from multiple perspectives.
First, to address the unique challenges of underwater environments, we selected
videos that represent typical underwater challenges including light variations,
water turbidity, and diverse viewing angles to construct the dataset. Second,
to ensure data diversity, the dataset covers a wide range of frame rates,
resolutions, 419 classes of marine animals, and various static plants and
terrains. Next, for task diversity, we adopted a structured design where
observation targets are categorized into two major classes: biological and
environmental. Each category includes content observation and change/action
observation, totaling 20 distinct task types. Finally, we designed several
challenging evaluation metrics to enable quantitative comparison and analysis
of different methods. Experiments on two representative VidLMs demonstrate that
fine-tuning VidLMs on UVLM significantly improves underwater world
understanding while also showing potential for slight improvements on existing
in-air VidLM benchmarks, such as VideoMME and Perception text. The dataset and
prompt engineering will be released publicly.

Result: 实验表明该方法具有可靠准确性和强扩展性。

Conclusion: 该框架为单目3D目标检测提供了一种实用且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection (M3OD) has long faced challenges due to data
scarcity caused by high annotation costs and inherent 2D-to-3D ambiguity.
Although various weakly supervised methods and pseudo-labeling methods have
been proposed to address these issues, they are mostly limited by
domain-specific learning or rely solely on shape information from a single
observation. In this paper, we propose a novel pseudo-labeling framework that
uses only video data and is more robust to occlusion, without requiring a
multi-view setup, additional sensors, camera poses, or domain-specific
training. Specifically, we explore a technique for aggregating the
pseudo-LiDARs of both static and dynamic objects across temporally adjacent
frames using object point tracking, enabling 3D attribute extraction in
scenarios where 3D data acquisition is infeasible. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method ensures reliable accuracy and strong scalability,
making it a practical and effective solution for M3OD.

TL;DR: CoMEL是一个用于持续多实例学习（MIL）的框架，通过增强定位能力减少遗忘，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索MIL在持续任务中的适应性，解决大规模图像（如WSIs）定位中的遗忘问题。

Method: 提出CoMEL框架，包含GDAT、BPPL和OWLoRA三个模块，分别用于实例编码、伪标签生成和遗忘缓解。

Result: 在三个WSI数据集上，CoMEL在持续MIL设置下，袋级和定位准确率分别提升11.00%和23.4%。

Conclusion: CoMEL在持续MIL任务中表现出色，解决了定位和遗忘问题，性能显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) significantly reduced annotation costs via
bag-level weak labels for large-scale images, such as histopathological whole
slide images (WSIs). However, its adaptability to continual tasks with minimal
forgetting has been rarely explored, especially on instance classification for
localization. Weakly incremental learning for semantic segmentation has been
studied for continual localization, but it focused on natural images,
leveraging global relationships among hundreds of small patches (e.g., $16
\times 16$) using pre-trained models. This approach seems infeasible for MIL
localization due to enormous amounts ($\sim 10^5$) of large patches (e.g., $256
\times 256$) and no available global relationships such as cancer cells. To
address these challenges, we propose Continual Multiple Instance Learning with
Enhanced Localization (CoMEL), an MIL framework for both localization and
adaptability with minimal forgetting. CoMEL consists of (1) Grouped Double
Attention Transformer (GDAT) for efficient instance encoding, (2) Bag
Prototypes-based Pseudo-Labeling (BPPL) for reliable instance pseudo-labeling,
and (3) Orthogonal Weighted Low-Rank Adaptation (OWLoRA) to mitigate forgetting
in both bag and instance classification. Extensive experiments on three public
WSI datasets demonstrate superior performance of CoMEL, outperforming the prior
arts by up to $11.00\%$ in bag-level accuracy and up to $23.4\%$ in
localization accuracy under the continual MIL setup.

Motivation: 传统检测器仅通过堆叠空间频率谱来表征时间信息，无法检测像素平面中的时间伪影。

Method: 对每个像素的时间轴进行1D傅里叶变换，提取对时间不一致性敏感的特征；引入注意力提议模块和联合变换器模块。

Result: 显著提升了深度伪造视频检测的鲁棒性，适用于多样化和挑战性的检测场景。

Conclusion: 该方法在深度伪造检测领域取得了重要进展。

Abstract: We introduce a deepfake video detection approach that exploits pixel-wise
temporal inconsistencies, which traditional spatial frequency-based detectors
often overlook. Traditional detectors represent temporal information merely by
stacking spatial frequency spectra across frames, resulting in the failure to
detect temporal artifacts in the pixel plane. Our approach performs a 1D
Fourier transform on the time axis for each pixel, extracting features highly
sensitive to temporal inconsistencies, especially in areas prone to unnatural
movements. To precisely locate regions containing the temporal artifacts, we
introduce an attention proposal module trained in an end-to-end manner.
Additionally, our joint transformer module effectively integrates pixel-wise
temporal frequency features with spatio-temporal context features, expanding
the range of detectable forgery artifacts. Our framework represents a
significant advancement in deepfake video detection, providing robust
performance across diverse and challenging detection scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割需要大量标注数据，但标注成本高。涂鸦标注是一种稀疏标注方式，但缺乏足够的特征学习和边界监督。

Method: TAB Net包含三重增强自恢复模块（TAS）和边界感知伪标签监督模块（BAP）。TAS通过三种增强策略提升特征学习，BAP通过融合双分支预测和边界感知损失优化伪标签。

Result: 在ACDC和MSCMR seg数据集上，TAB Net显著优于现有弱监督方法，性能接近全监督方法。

Conclusion: TAB Net为稀疏标注医学图像分割提供了一种高效解决方案，性能接近全监督方法。

Abstract: Background and objective: Medical image segmentation is a core task in
various clinical applications. However, acquiring large-scale, fully annotated
medical image datasets is both time-consuming and costly. Scribble annotations,
as a form of sparse labeling, provide an efficient and cost-effective
alternative for medical image segmentation. However, the sparsity of scribble
annotations limits the feature learning of the target region and lacks
sufficient boundary supervision, which poses significant challenges for
training segmentation networks. Methods: We propose TAB Net, a novel
weakly-supervised medical image segmentation framework, consisting of two key
components: the triplet augmentation self-recovery (TAS) module and the
boundary-aware pseudo-label supervision (BAP) module. The TAS module enhances
feature learning through three complementary augmentation strategies: intensity
transformation improves the model's sensitivity to texture and contrast
variations, cutout forces the network to capture local anatomical structures by
masking key regions, and jigsaw augmentation strengthens the modeling of global
anatomical layout by disrupting spatial continuity. By guiding the network to
recover complete masks from diverse augmented inputs, TAS promotes a deeper
semantic understanding of medical images under sparse supervision. The BAP
module enhances pseudo-supervision accuracy and boundary modeling by fusing
dual-branch predictions into a loss-weighted pseudo-label and introducing a
boundary-aware loss for fine-grained contour refinement. Results: Experimental
evaluations on two public datasets, ACDC and MSCMR seg, demonstrate that TAB
Net significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for scribble-based
weakly supervised segmentation. Moreover, it achieves performance comparable to
that of fully supervised methods.

Abstract: Wildlife re-identification aims to match individuals of the same species
across different observations. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models rely on
class labels to train supervised models for individual classification. This
dependence on annotated data has driven the curation of numerous large-scale

Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for wildlife re-identification. We automatically
extract two distinct views of an individual using temporal image pairs from
camera trap data without supervision. The image pairs train a self-supervised
model from a potentially endless stream of video data. We evaluate the learnt
representations against supervised features on open-world scenarios and
transfer learning in various wildlife downstream tasks. The analysis of the
experimental results shows that self-supervised models are more robust even
with limited data. Moreover, self-supervised features outperform supervision
across all downstream tasks. The code is available here

Abstract: Denoising diffusion models produce high-fidelity image samples by capturing
the image distribution in a progressive manner while initializing with a simple
distribution and compounding the distribution complexity. Although these models
have unlocked new applicabilities, the sampling mechanism of diffusion does not
offer means to extract image-specific semantic representation, which is
inherently provided by auto-encoders. The encoding component of auto-encoders
enables mapping between a specific image and its latent space, thereby offering
explicit means of enforcing structures in the latent space. By integrating an
encoder with the diffusion model, we establish an auto-encoding formulation,
which learns image-specific representations and offers means to organize the
latent space. In this work, First, we devise a mechanism to structure the
latent space of a diffusion auto-encoding model, towards recognizing
region-specific cellular patterns in brain images. We enforce the
representations to regress positional information of the patches from
high-resolution images. This creates a conducive latent space for
differentiating tissue types of the brain. Second, we devise an unsupervised
tear artifact restoration technique based on neighborhood awareness, utilizing
latent representations and the constrained generation capability of diffusion
models during inference. Third, through representational guidance and
leveraging the inference time steerable noising and denoising capability of
diffusion, we devise an unsupervised JPEG artifact restoration technique.

Abstract: Multi-Object Tracking in thermal images is essential for surveillance
systems, particularly in challenging environments where RGB cameras struggle
due to low visibility or poor lighting conditions. Thermal sensors enhance
recognition tasks by capturing infrared signatures, but a major challenge is
their low-level feature representation, which makes it difficult to accurately
detect and track pedestrians. To address this, the paper introduces a novel
tuning method for pedestrian tracking, specifically designed to handle the
complex motion patterns in thermal imagery. The proposed framework optimizes
two-stages, ensuring that each stage is tuned with the most suitable
hyperparameters to maximize tracking performance. By fine-tuning
hyperparameters for real-time tracking, the method achieves high accuracy
without relying on complex reidentification or motion models. Extensive
experiments on PBVS Thermal MOT dataset demonstrate that the approach is highly
effective across various thermal camera conditions, making it a robust solution
for real-world surveillance applications.

Abstract: Face identification systems operating in the ciphertext domain have garnered
significant attention due to increasing privacy concerns and the potential
recovery of original facial data. However, as the size of ciphertext template
libraries grows, the face retrieval process becomes progressively more
time-intensive. To address this challenge, we propose a novel and efficient
scheme for face retrieval in the ciphertext domain, termed Privacy-Preserving
Preselection for Face Identification Based on Packing (PFIP). PFIP incorporates
an innovative preselection mechanism to reduce computational overhead and a
packing module to enhance the flexibility of biometric systems during the
enrollment stage. Extensive experiments conducted on the LFW and CASIA datasets

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为AvatarMakeup的3D化妆方法，通过预训练的扩散模型从单张参考照片中转移化妆模式，解决了现有方法在动态表情和多视角下的一致性、身份保持及细节控制方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D高斯编辑方法无法满足实现真实化妆效果的基本要求：动态表情下的外观一致性、化妆过程中的身份保持以及对精细细节的精确控制。

Method: 采用从粗到细的策略，首先通过Coherent Duplication方法粗粒度地应用化妆并确保一致性，然后通过Refinement Module细化化妆效果。扩散模型用于生成化妆图像作为监督。

Result: 实验表明，AvatarMakeup在化妆转移质量和动画一致性方面达到了最先进的水平。

Conclusion: AvatarMakeup方法有效解决了3D虚拟角色化妆中的关键问题，实现了高质量的化妆效果和动态一致性。

Abstract: Similar to facial beautification in real life, 3D virtual avatars require
personalized customization to enhance their visual appeal, yet this area
remains insufficiently explored. Although current 3D Gaussian editing methods
can be adapted for facial makeup purposes, these methods fail to meet the
fundamental requirements for achieving realistic makeup effects: 1) ensuring a
consistent appearance during drivable expressions, 2) preserving the identity
throughout the makeup process, and 3) enabling precise control over fine
details. To address these, we propose a specialized 3D makeup method named
AvatarMakeup, leveraging a pretrained diffusion model to transfer makeup
patterns from a single reference photo of any individual. We adopt a
coarse-to-fine idea to first maintain the consistent appearance and identity,
and then to refine the details. In particular, the diffusion model is employed
to generate makeup images as supervision. Due to the uncertainties in diffusion
process, the generated images are inconsistent across different viewpoints and
expressions. Therefore, we propose a Coherent Duplication method to coarsely
apply makeup to the target while ensuring consistency across dynamic and
multiview effects. Coherent Duplication optimizes a global UV map by recoding
the averaged facial attributes among the generated makeup images. By querying
the global UV map, it easily synthesizes coherent makeup guidance from
arbitrary views and expressions to optimize the target avatar. Given the coarse
makeup avatar, we further enhance the makeup by incorporating a Refinement
Module into the diffusion model to achieve high makeup quality. Experiments
demonstrate that AvatarMakeup achieves state-of-the-art makeup transfer quality
and consistency throughout animation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人因低帧率摄像头和检测算法速度限制导致任务执行时间增加，现有工具未能充分利用FPGA的PL部分。

Method: 使用FINN架构在FPGA的PL部分部署三种量化ANN模型（MobileNet v1、CNV 2-bit、CNV 1-bit），并在RG2C数据集上训练。

Result: MobileNet v1表现最佳，成功率达98%，推理速度为6611 FPS。

Conclusion: FPGA可有效加速ANN，适用于注意力机制，提升机器人任务执行效率。

Abstract: Robots usually slow down for canning to detect objects while moving.
Additionally, the robot's camera is configured with a low framerate to track
the velocity of the detection algorithms. This would be constrained while
executing tasks and exploring, making robots increase the task execution time.
AMD has developed the Vitis-AI framework to deploy detection algorithms into
FPGAs. However, this tool does not fully use the FPGAs' PL. In this work, we
use the FINN architecture to deploy three ANNs, MobileNet v1 with 4-bit
quantisation, CNV with 2-bit quantisation, and CNV with 1-bit quantisation
(BNN), inside an FPGA's PL. The models were trained on the RG2C dataset. This
is a self-acquired dataset released in open access. MobileNet v1 performed
better, reaching a success rate of 98 % and an inference speed of 6611 FPS. In
this work, we proved that we can use FPGAs to speed up ANNs and make them
suitable for attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Different from general object detection, moving infrared small target
detection faces huge challenges due to tiny target size and weak background
contrast.Currently, most existing methods are fully-supervised, heavily relying
on a large number of manual target-wise annotations. However, manually
annotating video sequences is often expensive and time-consuming, especially
for low-quality infrared frame images. Inspired by general object detection,
non-fully supervised strategies ($e.g.$, weakly supervised) are believed to be
potential in reducing annotation requirements. To break through traditional
fully-supervised frameworks, as the first exploration work, this paper proposes
a new weakly-supervised contrastive learning (WeCoL) scheme, only requires
simple target quantity prompts during model training.Specifically, in our
scheme, based on the pretrained segment anything model (SAM), a potential
target mining strategy is designed to integrate target activation maps and
multi-frame energy accumulation.Besides, contrastive learning is adopted to
further improve the reliability of pseudo-labels, by calculating the similarity
between positive and negative samples in feature subspace.Moreover, we propose
a long-short term motion-aware learning scheme to simultaneously model the
local motion patterns and global motion trajectory of small targets.The
extensive experiments on two public datasets (DAUB and ITSDT-15K) verify that
our weakly-supervised scheme could often outperform early fully-supervised
methods. Even, its performance could reach over 90\% of state-of-the-art (SOTA)
fully-supervised ones.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多目标跟踪数据集场景简单且不真实，难以支持复杂场景下的算法研究。

Method: 通过第一人称视角拍摄真实复杂场景，构建包含33个视频和5,185条轨迹的数据集，并标注完整边界框和唯一ID。

Result: 数据集为复杂场景下的算法开发提供了平台，并测试了多个SOTA模型和基础模型的性能。

Conclusion: CrowdTrack数据集填补了现有不足，有望推动复杂场景下的多行人跟踪算法发展。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking is a classic field in computer vision. Among them,
pedestrian tracking has extremely high application value and has become the
most popular research category. Existing methods mainly use motion or
appearance information for tracking, which is often difficult in complex
scenarios. For the motion information, mutual occlusions between objects often
prevent updating of the motion state; for the appearance information,
non-robust results are often obtained due to reasons such as only partial
visibility of the object or blurred images. Although learning how to perform
tracking in these situations from the annotated data is the simplest solution,
the existing MOT dataset fails to satisfy this solution. Existing methods
mainly have two drawbacks: relatively simple scene composition and
non-realistic scenarios. Although some of the video sequences in existing
dataset do not have the above-mentioned drawbacks, the number is far from
adequate for research purposes. To this end, we propose a difficult large-scale
dataset for multi-pedestrian tracking, shot mainly from the first-person view
and all from real-life complex scenarios. We name it ``CrowdTrack'' because
there are numerous objects in most of the sequences. Our dataset consists of 33
videos, containing a total of 5,185 trajectories. Each object is annotated with
a complete bounding box and a unique object ID. The dataset will provide a
platform to facilitate the development of algorithms that remain effective in
complex situations. We analyzed the dataset comprehensively and tested multiple
SOTA models on our dataset. Besides, we analyzed the performance of the
foundation models on our dataset. The dataset and project code is released at:

Result: 在多种医学图像识别任务（分类、语义分割、病变检测）中表现优异，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MedFormer通过创新结构和注意力机制，为医学图像识别提供了高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical image recognition serves as a key way to aid in clinical diagnosis,
enabling more accurate and timely identification of diseases and abnormalities.
Vision transformer-based approaches have proven effective in handling various
medical recognition tasks. However, these methods encounter two primary
challenges. First, they are often task-specific and architecture-tailored,
limiting their general applicability. Second, they usually either adopt full
attention to model long-range dependencies, resulting in high computational
costs, or rely on handcrafted sparse attention, potentially leading to
suboptimal performance. To tackle these issues, we present MedFormer, an
efficient medical vision transformer with two key ideas. First, it employs a
pyramid scaling structure as a versatile backbone for various medical image
recognition tasks, including image classification and dense prediction tasks
such as semantic segmentation and lesion detection. This structure facilitates
hierarchical feature representation while reducing the computation load of
feature maps, highly beneficial for boosting performance. Second, it introduces
a novel Dual Sparse Selection Attention (DSSA) with content awareness to
improve computational efficiency and robustness against noise while maintaining
high performance. As the core building technique of MedFormer, DSSA is
explicitly designed to attend to the most relevant content. In addition, a
detailed theoretical analysis has been conducted, demonstrating that MedFormer
has superior generality and efficiency in comparison to existing medical vision
transformers. Extensive experiments on a variety of imaging modality datasets
consistently show that MedFormer is highly effective in enhancing performance
across all three above-mentioned medical image recognition tasks. The code is

Method: 引入时间感知的监督对比损失，结合时间邻接约束，改进息肉跟踪和聚类。

Result: 在公开数据集上验证，碎片化率比现有方法降低了2.2倍。

Conclusion: 时间感知对息肉计数至关重要，新方法达到了最新技术水平。

Abstract: Automated polyp counting in colonoscopy is a crucial step toward automated
procedure reporting and quality control, aiming to enhance the
cost-effectiveness of colonoscopy screening. Counting polyps in a procedure
involves detecting and tracking polyps, and then clustering tracklets that
belong to the same polyp entity. Existing methods for polyp counting rely on
self-supervised learning and primarily leverage visual appearance, neglecting
temporal relationships in both tracklet feature learning and clustering stages.
In this work, we introduce a paradigm shift by proposing a supervised
contrastive loss that incorporates temporally-aware soft targets. Our approach
captures intra-polyp variability while preserving inter-polyp discriminability,
leading to more robust clustering. Additionally, we improve tracklet clustering
by integrating a temporal adjacency constraint, reducing false positive
re-associations between visually similar but temporally distant tracklets. We
train and validate our method on publicly available datasets and evaluate its
performance with a leave-one-out cross-validation strategy. Results demonstrate
a 2.2x reduction in fragmentation rate compared to prior approaches. Our
results highlight the importance of temporal awareness in polyp counting,
establishing a new state-of-the-art. Code is available at

Conclusion: MC-INR通过创新设计有效解决了现有INR方法的局限性，提升了复杂数据处理的性能。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) are widely used to encode data as
continuous functions, enabling the visualization of large-scale multivariate
scientific simulation data with reduced memory usage. However, existing
INR-based methods face three main limitations: (1) inflexible representation of
complex structures, (2) primarily focusing on single-variable data, and (3)
dependence on structured grids. Thus, their performance degrades when applied
to complex real-world datasets. To address these limitations, we propose a
novel neural network-based framework, MC-INR, which handles multivariate data
on unstructured grids. It combines meta-learning and clustering to enable
flexible encoding of complex structures. To further improve performance, we
introduce a residual-based dynamic re-clustering mechanism that adaptively
partitions clusters based on local error. We also propose a branched layer to
leverage multivariate data through independent branches simultaneously.
Experimental results demonstrate that MC-INR outperforms existing methods on
scientific data encoding tasks.

Abstract: Pedestrian detection in RGB images is a key task in pedestrian safety, as the
most common sensor in autonomous vehicles and advanced driver assistance
systems is the RGB camera. A challenge in RGB pedestrian detection, that does
not appear to have large public datasets, is low-light conditions. As a
solution, in this research, we propose an automated infrared-RGB labeling
pipeline. The proposed pipeline consists of 1) Infrared detection, where a
fine-tuned model for infrared pedestrian detection is used 2) Label transfer
process from the infrared detections to their RGB counterparts 3) Training
object detection models using the generated labels for low-light RGB pedestrian
detection. The research was performed using the KAIST dataset. For the
evaluation, object detection models were trained on the generated autolabels
and ground truth labels. When compared on a previously unseen image sequence,
the results showed that the models trained on generated labels outperformed the
ones trained on ground-truth labels in 6 out of 9 cases for the mAP@50 and
mAP@50-95 metrics. The source code for this research is available at

Abstract: This paper introduces IMASHRIMP, an adapted system for the automated
morphological analysis of white shrimp (Penaeus vannamei}, aimed at optimizing
genetic selection tasks in aquaculture. Existing deep learning and computer
vision techniques were modified to address the specific challenges of shrimp
morphology analysis from RGBD images. IMASHRIMP incorporates two discrimination
modules, based on a modified ResNet-50 architecture, to classify images by the
point of view and determine rostrum integrity. It is proposed a "two-factor
authentication (human and IA)" system, it reduces human error in view
classification from 0.97% to 0% and in rostrum detection from 12.46% to 3.64%.
Additionally, a pose estimation module was adapted from VitPose to predict 23
key points on the shrimp's skeleton, with separate networks for lateral and
dorsal views. A morphological regression module, using a Support Vector Machine
(SVM) model, was integrated to convert pixel measurements to centimeter units.
Experimental results show that the system effectively reduces human error,
achieving a mean average precision (mAP) of 97.94% for pose estimation and a
pixel-to-centimeter conversion error of 0.07 (+/- 0.1) cm. IMASHRIMP
demonstrates the potential to automate and accelerate shrimp morphological

TL;DR: MoGe-2是一种先进的开放域几何估计模型，可从单张图像恢复场景的度量尺度3D点图。它在MoGe的基础上改进，通过统一数据细化方法提升几何细节，并在混合数据集上训练，实现了相对几何精度、度量尺度和细粒度细节恢复的优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如MoGe）只能预测未知尺度的仿射不变点图，无法满足度量几何预测的需求。此外，真实数据中的噪声和误差会削弱几何细节。

Method: 扩展MoGe以预测度量几何，同时保持仿射不变点表示的相对几何精度。开发统一数据细化方法，利用合成标签过滤和补全真实数据，提升几何细节。

Result: 在混合数据集上训练和评估，MoGe-2在相对几何精度、度量尺度和细粒度细节恢复方面表现优越，超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: MoGe-2首次同时实现了准确的相对几何、精确的度量尺度和细粒度细节恢复，为单图像几何估计提供了更全面的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose MoGe-2, an advanced open-domain geometry estimation model that
recovers a metric scale 3D point map of a scene from a single image. Our method
builds upon the recent monocular geometry estimation approach, MoGe, which
predicts affine-invariant point maps with unknown scales. We explore effective
strategies to extend MoGe for metric geometry prediction without compromising
the relative geometry accuracy provided by the affine-invariant point
representation. Additionally, we discover that noise and errors in real data
diminish fine-grained detail in the predicted geometry. We address this by
developing a unified data refinement approach that filters and completes real
data from different sources using sharp synthetic labels, significantly
enhancing the granularity of the reconstructed geometry while maintaining the
overall accuracy. We train our model on a large corpus of mixed datasets and
conducted comprehensive evaluations, demonstrating its superior performance in
achieving accurate relative geometry, precise metric scale, and fine-grained
detail recovery -- capabilities that no previous methods have simultaneously
achieved.

Conclusion: 该方法能够从复杂环境中准确估计交互动作，为未来姿态估计和行为理解研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Due to visual ambiguities and inter-person occlusions, existing human pose
estimation methods cannot recover plausible close interactions from in-the-wild
videos. Even state-of-the-art large foundation models~(\eg, SAM) cannot
accurately distinguish human semantics in such challenging scenarios. In this
work, we find that human appearance can provide a straightforward cue to
address these obstacles. Based on this observation, we propose a dual-branch
optimization framework to reconstruct accurate interactive motions with
plausible body contacts constrained by human appearances, social proxemics, and
physical laws. Specifically, we first train a diffusion model to learn the
human proxemic behavior and pose prior knowledge. The trained network and two
optimizable tensors are then incorporated into a dual-branch optimization
framework to reconstruct human motions and appearances. Several constraints
based on 3D Gaussians, 2D keypoints, and mesh penetrations are also designed to
assist the optimization. With the proxemics prior and diverse constraints, our
method is capable of estimating accurate interactions from in-the-wild videos
captured in complex environments. We further build a dataset with pseudo
ground-truth interaction annotations, which may promote future research on pose
estimation and human behavior understanding. Experimental results on several
benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches. The

Motivation: 血管在医学中有多种表示方法，但通常各自独立使用，缺乏统一的框架。

Method: 利用可微分体素化，通过形状到分割的拟合自动提取血管参数模型，并使用三次B样条参数化中心线和半径。

Result: 实验证明，该方法能准确捕捉复杂血管的几何形状，如主动脉、动脉瘤和脑血管。

Conclusion: 该框架成功整合了三种表示方法，并实现了高保真度的网格生成和操作。

Abstract: Vessels are complex structures in the body that have been studied extensively
in multiple representations. While voxelization is the most common of them,
meshes and parametric models are critical in various applications due to their
desirable properties. However, these representations are typically extracted
through segmentations and used disjointly from each other. We propose a
framework that joins the three representations under differentiable
transformations. By leveraging differentiable voxelization, we automatically
extract a parametric shape model of the vessels through shape-to-segmentation
fitting, where we learn shape parameters from segmentations without the
explicit need for ground-truth shape parameters. The vessel is parametrized as
centerlines and radii using cubic B-splines, ensuring smoothness and continuity
by construction. Meshes are differentiably extracted from the learned shape
parameters, resulting in high-fidelity meshes that can be manipulated post-fit.
Our method can accurately capture the geometry of complex vessels, as
demonstrated by the volumetric fits in experiments on aortas, aneurysms, and
brain vessels.

Result: 在10个数据集、4个任务和3种模态上全面评估，$S^2DC$始终优于现有方法。

Conclusion: $S^2DC$通过学习结构感知表征，为医学图像自监督学习提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D medical image self-supervised learning (mSSL) holds great promise for
medical analysis. Effectively supporting broader applications requires
considering anatomical structure variations in location, scale, and morphology,
which are crucial for capturing meaningful distinctions. However, previous mSSL
methods partition images with fixed-size patches, often ignoring the structure
variations. In this work, we introduce a novel perspective on 3D medical images
with the goal of learning structure-aware representations. We assume that
patches within the same structure share the same semantics (semantic
consistency) while those from different structures exhibit distinct semantics
(semantic discrepancy). Based on this assumption, we propose an mSSL framework
named $S^2DC$, achieving Structure-aware Semantic Discrepancy and Consistency
in two steps. First, $S^2DC$ enforces distinct representations for different
patches to increase semantic discrepancy by leveraging an optimal transport
strategy. Second, $S^2DC$ advances semantic consistency at the structural level
based on neighborhood similarity distribution. By bridging patch-level and
structure-level representations, $S^2DC$ achieves structure-aware
representations. Thoroughly evaluated across 10 datasets, 4 tasks, and 3
modalities, our proposed method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods in mSSL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频理解的计算复杂性和内存成本高，传统Transformer模型难以处理长序列输入。

Method: 用线性RNN语言模型替代LLM，结合视觉标记合并技术，按大小升序重排视觉标记以提高效率。

Result: AuroraLong在多个视频基准测试中表现接近Transformer模型，且仅需2B参数和公开数据训练。

Conclusion: 线性RNN模型有望降低长视频理解的计算门槛，推动其普及。

Abstract: The challenge of long video understanding lies in its high computational
complexity and prohibitive memory cost, since the memory and computation
required by transformer-based LLMs scale quadratically with input sequence
length. We propose AuroraLong to address this challenge by replacing the LLM
component in MLLMs with a linear RNN language model that handles input sequence
of arbitrary length with constant-size hidden states. To further increase
throughput and efficiency, we combine visual token merge with linear RNN models
by reordering the visual tokens by their sizes in ascending order. Despite
having only 2B parameters and being trained exclusively on public data,
AuroraLong achieves performance comparable to Transformer-based models of
similar size trained on private datasets across multiple video benchmarks. This
demonstrates the potential of efficient, linear RNNs to democratize long video
understanding by lowering its computational entry barrier. To our best
knowledge, we are the first to use a linear RNN based LLM backbone in a
LLaVA-like model for open-ended video understanding.

Abstract: The increasing importance of Vision-Based Navigation (VBN) algorithms in
space missions raises numerous challenges in ensuring their reliability and
operational robustness. Sensor faults can lead to inaccurate outputs from
navigation algorithms or even complete data processing faults, potentially
compromising mission objectives. Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers a powerful
solution for detecting such faults, overcoming many of the limitations
associated with traditional fault detection methods. However, the primary
obstacle to the adoption of AI in this context is the lack of sufficient and
representative datasets containing faulty image data.
  This study addresses these challenges by focusing on an interplanetary
exploration mission scenario. A comprehensive analysis of potential fault cases
in camera sensors used within the VBN pipeline is presented. The causes and
effects of these faults are systematically characterized, including their
impact on image quality and navigation algorithm performance, as well as
commonly employed mitigation strategies. To support this analysis, a simulation
framework is introduced to recreate faulty conditions in synthetically
generated images, enabling a systematic and controlled reproduction of faulty
data. The resulting dataset of fault-injected images provides a valuable tool
for training and testing AI-based fault detection algorithms. The final link to
the dataset will be added after an embargo period. For peer-reviewers, this
private link is available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成图像（AIGI）的滥用威胁公共信息安全，现有检测技术缺乏可解释性和对最新技术的泛化能力。

Method: 构建Holmes-Set数据集（包括Holmes-SFTSet和Holmes-DPOSet），提出Multi-Expert Jury数据标注方法，设计Holmes Pipeline三阶段训练框架（预训练、监督微调、偏好优化）。

Result: AIGI-Holmes模型在三个基准测试中表现优异，生成可解释且符合人类偏好的检测结果。

Conclusion: Holmes-Set和Holmes Pipeline有效提升了AIGI检测的可解释性和泛化能力，AIGI-Holmes模型具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: The rapid development of AI-generated content (AIGC) technology has led to
the misuse of highly realistic AI-generated images (AIGI) in spreading
misinformation, posing a threat to public information security. Although
existing AIGI detection techniques are generally effective, they face two
issues: 1) a lack of human-verifiable explanations, and 2) a lack of
generalization in the latest generation technology. To address these issues, we
introduce a large-scale and comprehensive dataset, Holmes-Set, which includes
the Holmes-SFTSet, an instruction-tuning dataset with explanations on whether
images are AI-generated, and the Holmes-DPOSet, a human-aligned preference
dataset. Our work introduces an efficient data annotation method called the
Multi-Expert Jury, enhancing data generation through structured MLLM
explanations and quality control via cross-model evaluation, expert defect
filtering, and human preference modification. In addition, we propose Holmes
Pipeline, a meticulously designed three-stage training framework comprising
visual expert pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and direct preference
optimization. Holmes Pipeline adapts multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
for AIGI detection while generating human-verifiable and human-aligned
explanations, ultimately yielding our model AIGI-Holmes. During the inference
stage, we introduce a collaborative decoding strategy that integrates the model
perception of the visual expert with the semantic reasoning of MLLMs, further
enhancing the generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments on three
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our AIGI-Holmes.

Motivation: 扩散模型在贝叶斯计算成像中表现出强大的图像先验能力，但现有方法存在灵活性或效率问题。

Method: 通过深度展开和模型蒸馏，将扩散模型转化为少步条件模型，并首次将深度展开应用于蒙特卡洛采样方案。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在准确性和计算效率上优于现有技术，同时保持了灵活性。

Conclusion: 新框架为贝叶斯计算成像提供了一种高效且灵活的后验采样方法。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as powerful image priors in Bayesian
computational imaging. Two primary strategies have been proposed for leveraging
DMs in this context: Plug-and-Play methods, which are zero-shot and highly
flexible but rely on approximations; and specialized conditional DMs, which
achieve higher accuracy and faster inference for specific tasks through
supervised training. In this work, we introduce a novel framework that
integrates deep unfolding and model distillation to transform a DM image prior
into a few-step conditional model for posterior sampling. A central innovation
of our approach is the unfolding of a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm
- specifically, the recently proposed LATINO Langevin sampler (Spagnoletti et
al., 2025) - representing the first known instance of deep unfolding applied to
a Monte Carlo sampling scheme. We demonstrate our proposed unfolded and
distilled samplers through extensive experiments and comparisons with the state
of the art, where they achieve excellent accuracy and computational efficiency,
while retaining the flexibility to adapt to variations in the forward model at
inference time.

Result: 实验表明，APT能有效减少过拟合，保持先验知识，并在有限数据下生成高质量、多样化的图像。

Conclusion: APT为扩散模型的个性化训练提供了一种高效且稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: Personalizing diffusion models using limited data presents significant
challenges, including overfitting, loss of prior knowledge, and degradation of
text alignment. Overfitting leads to shifts in the noise prediction
distribution, disrupting the denoising trajectory and causing the model to lose
semantic coherence. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Personalized Training
(APT), a novel framework that mitigates overfitting by employing adaptive
training strategies and regularizing the model's internal representations
during fine-tuning. APT consists of three key components: (1) Adaptive Training
Adjustment, which introduces an overfitting indicator to detect the degree of
overfitting at each time step bin and applies adaptive data augmentation and
adaptive loss weighting based on this indicator; (2)Representation
Stabilization, which regularizes the mean and variance of intermediate feature
maps to prevent excessive shifts in noise prediction; and (3) Attention
Alignment for Prior Knowledge Preservation, which aligns the cross-attention
maps of the fine-tuned model with those of the pretrained model to maintain
prior knowledge and semantic coherence. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate that APT effectively mitigates overfitting, preserves prior
knowledge, and outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality, diverse
images with limited reference data.

TL;DR: CanonSwap提出了一种新的视频人脸交换框架，通过解耦外观和运动信息，解决了现有方法在保持目标动态属性上的不足。


<details>

Motivation: 现有方法在高质量身份转移方面表现良好，但在保持目标面部的动态属性（如表情、头部姿势等）上表现不佳。

Method: CanonSwap通过消除运动相关信息，在统一规范空间内修改身份，再将其重新整合到原始视频空间。此外，设计了部分身份调制模块和细粒度同步评估指标。

Result: 实验表明，CanonSwap在视觉质量、时间一致性和身份保持方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CanonSwap通过解耦外观和运动信息，有效提升了视频人脸交换的效果，同时保持了目标动态属性的准确性。

Abstract: Video face swapping aims to address two primary challenges: effectively
transferring the source identity to the target video and accurately preserving
the dynamic attributes of the target face, such as head poses, facial
expressions, lip-sync, \etc. Existing methods mainly focus on achieving
high-quality identity transfer but often fall short in maintaining the dynamic
attributes of the target face, leading to inconsistent results. We attribute
this issue to the inherent coupling of facial appearance and motion in videos.
To address this, we propose CanonSwap, a novel video face-swapping framework
that decouples motion information from appearance information. Specifically,
CanonSwap first eliminates motion-related information, enabling identity
modification within a unified canonical space. Subsequently, the swapped
feature is reintegrated into the original video space, ensuring the
preservation of the target face's dynamic attributes. To further achieve
precise identity transfer with minimal artifacts and enhanced realism, we
design a Partial Identity Modulation module that adaptively integrates source
identity features using a spatial mask to restrict modifications to facial
regions. Additionally, we introduce several fine-grained synchronization
metrics to comprehensively evaluate the performance of video face swapping
methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms existing approaches in terms of visual quality, temporal
consistency, and identity preservation. Our project page are publicly available

Motivation: 现有方法依赖2D到3D特征对齐，导致3D理解能力有限和语义信息丢失。

Result: 实验表明，SIU3R在3D重建、理解及同时任务中均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: SIU3R的无对齐框架和任务互益设计有效提升了性能。

Abstract: Simultaneous understanding and 3D reconstruction plays an important role in
developing end-to-end embodied intelligent systems. To achieve this, recent
approaches resort to 2D-to-3D feature alignment paradigm, which leads to
limited 3D understanding capability and potential semantic information loss. In
light of this, we propose SIU3R, the first alignment-free framework for
generalizable simultaneous understanding and 3D reconstruction from unposed
images. Specifically, SIU3R bridges reconstruction and understanding tasks via
pixel-aligned 3D representation, and unifies multiple understanding tasks into
a set of unified learnable queries, enabling native 3D understanding without
the need of alignment with 2D models. To encourage collaboration between the
two tasks with shared representation, we further conduct in-depth analyses of
their mutual benefits, and propose two lightweight modules to facilitate their
interaction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance not only on the individual tasks of 3D
reconstruction and understanding, but also on the task of simultaneous
understanding and 3D reconstruction, highlighting the advantages of our
alignment-free framework and the effectiveness of the mutual benefit designs.

Motivation: 现有关键点引导模型在生成非刚性物体（如动物）和多实例重叠场景时存在局限性，主要由于方法本身的不足和缺乏合适的数据集。

Method: 设计了UniMC框架，将实例和关键点条件整合为紧凑令牌，并提出了HAIG-2.9M数据集，包含丰富的标注和严格的人工检查。

Result: 实验证明HAIG-2.9M数据集的高质量和UniMC的有效性，尤其在遮挡和多类场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: UniMC和HAIG-2.9M为关键点引导的图像生成提供了更通用的解决方案，填补了现有方法的不足。

Abstract: Although significant advancements have been achieved in the progress of
keypoint-guided Text-to-Image diffusion models, existing mainstream
keypoint-guided models encounter challenges in controlling the generation of
more general non-rigid objects beyond humans (e.g., animals). Moreover, it is
difficult to generate multiple overlapping humans and animals based on keypoint
controls solely. These challenges arise from two main aspects: the inherent
limitations of existing controllable methods and the lack of suitable datasets.
First, we design a DiT-based framework, named UniMC, to explore unifying
controllable multi-class image generation. UniMC integrates instance- and
keypoint-level conditions into compact tokens, incorporating attributes such as
class, bounding box, and keypoint coordinates. This approach overcomes the
limitations of previous methods that struggled to distinguish instances and
classes due to their reliance on skeleton images as conditions. Second, we
propose HAIG-2.9M, a large-scale, high-quality, and diverse dataset designed
for keypoint-guided human and animal image generation. HAIG-2.9M includes 786K
images with 2.9M instances. This dataset features extensive annotations such as
keypoints, bounding boxes, and fine-grained captions for both humans and
animals, along with rigorous manual inspection to ensure annotation accuracy.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the high quality of HAIG-2.9M and the
effectiveness of UniMC, particularly in heavy occlusions and multi-class
scenarios.

Result: 显著提升局部细节生成质量，同时保持整体生成效果。

Conclusion: FairHuman在不同场景下有效提升了人像生成的性能。

Abstract: Image generation has achieved remarkable progress with the development of
large-scale text-to-image models, especially diffusion-based models. However,
generating human images with plausible details, such as faces or hands, remains
challenging due to insufficient supervision of local regions during training.
To address this issue, we propose FairHuman, a multi-objective fine-tuning
approach designed to enhance both global and local generation quality fairly.
Specifically, we first construct three learning objectives: a global objective
derived from the default diffusion objective function and two local objectives
for hands and faces based on pre-annotated positional priors. Subsequently, we
derive the optimal parameter updating strategy under the guidance of the
Minimum Potential Delay (MPD) criterion, thereby attaining fairness-ware
optimization for this multi-objective problem. Based on this, our proposed
method can achieve significant improvements in generating challenging local
details while maintaining overall quality. Extensive experiments showcase the
effectiveness of our method in improving the performance of human image
generation under different scenarios.

Abstract: Pixel-wise annotations are notoriously labourious and costly to obtain in the
medical domain. To mitigate this burden, weakly supervised approaches based on
bounding box annotations-much easier to acquire-offer a practical alternative.
Vision foundation models have recently shown noteworthy segmentation
performance when provided with prompts such as points or bounding boxes. Prompt
learning exploits these models by adapting them to downstream tasks and
automating segmentation, thereby reducing user intervention. However, existing
prompt learning approaches depend on fully annotated segmentation masks. This
paper proposes a novel framework that combines the representational power of
foundation models with the annotation efficiency of weakly supervised
segmentation. More specifically, our approach automates prompt generation for
foundation models using only bounding box annotations. Our proposed
optimization scheme integrates multiple constraints derived from box
annotations with pseudo-labels generated by the prompted foundation model.
Extensive experiments across multimodal datasets reveal that our weakly
supervised method achieves an average Dice score of 84.90% in a limited data
setting, outperforming existing fully-supervised and weakly-supervised
approaches. The code is available at

Abstract: As large models gain traction, vision-language-action (VLA) systems are
enabling robots to tackle increasingly complex tasks. However, limited by the
difficulty of data collection, progress has mainly focused on controlling
simple gripper end-effectors. There is little research on functional grasping
with large models for human-like dexterous hands. In this paper, we introduce
DexVLG, a large Vision-Language-Grasp model for Dexterous grasp pose prediction
aligned with language instructions using single-view RGBD input. To accomplish
this, we generate a dataset of 170 million dexterous grasp poses mapped to
semantic parts across 174,000 objects in simulation, paired with detailed
part-level captions. This large-scale dataset, named DexGraspNet 3.0, is used
to train a VLM and flow-matching-based pose head capable of producing
instruction-aligned grasp poses for tabletop objects. To assess DexVLG's
performance, we create benchmarks in physics-based simulations and conduct
real-world experiments. Extensive testing demonstrates DexVLG's strong
zero-shot generalization capabilities-achieving over 76% zero-shot execution
success rate and state-of-the-art part-grasp accuracy in simulation-and
successful part-aligned grasps on physical objects in real-world scenarios.

Result: 在图像分类和Darcy流任务中，MANO性能媲美ViT和Swin Transformer，同时显著降低运行时和内存开销。

Conclusion: MANO通过多尺度注意力机制，高效解决了Transformer的高分辨率输入问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Transformers have become the de facto standard for a wide range of tasks,
from image classification to physics simulations. Despite their impressive
performance, the quadratic complexity of standard Transformers in both memory
and time with respect to the input length makes them impractical for processing
high-resolution inputs. Therefore, several variants have been proposed, the
most successful relying on patchification, downsampling, or coarsening
techniques, often at the cost of losing the finest-scale details. In this work,
we take a different approach. Inspired by state-of-the-art techniques in
$n$-body numerical simulations, we cast attention as an interaction problem
between grid points. We introduce the Multipole Attention Neural Operator
(MANO), which computes attention in a distance-based multiscale fashion. MANO
maintains, in each attention head, a global receptive field and achieves linear
time and memory complexity with respect to the number of grid points. Empirical
results on image classification and Darcy flows demonstrate that MANO rivals
state-of-the-art models such as ViT and Swin Transformer, while reducing
runtime and peak memory usage by orders of magnitude. We open source our code
for reproducibility at https://github.com/AlexColagrande/MANO.

Conclusion: PWOOD框架为定向目标检测提供了一种低成本、高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: The growing demand for oriented object detection (OOD) across various domains
has driven significant research in this area. However, the high cost of dataset
annotation remains a major concern. Current mainstream OOD algorithms can be
mainly categorized into three types: (1) fully supervised methods using
complete oriented bounding box (OBB) annotations, (2) semi-supervised methods
using partial OBB annotations, and (3) weakly supervised methods using weak
annotations such as horizontal boxes or points. However, these algorithms
inevitably increase the cost of models in terms of annotation speed or
annotation cost. To address this issue, we propose:(1) the first Partial
Weakly-Supervised Oriented Object Detection (PWOOD) framework based on
partially weak annotations (horizontal boxes or single points), which can
efficiently leverage large amounts of unlabeled data, significantly
outperforming weakly supervised algorithms trained with partially weak
annotations, also offers a lower cost solution; (2) Orientation-and-Scale-aware
Student (OS-Student) model capable of learning orientation and scale
information with only a small amount of orientation-agnostic or scale-agnostic
weak annotations; and (3) Class-Agnostic Pseudo-Label Filtering strategy (CPF)
to reduce the model's sensitivity to static filtering thresholds. Comprehensive
experiments on DOTA-v1.0/v1.5/v2.0 and DIOR datasets demonstrate that our PWOOD
framework performs comparably to, or even surpasses, traditional
semi-supervised algorithms.

Abstract: In the aftermath of earthquakes, social media images have become a crucial
resource for disaster reconnaissance, providing immediate insights into the
extent of damage. Traditional approaches to damage severity assessment in
post-earthquake social media images often rely on classification methods, which
are inherently subjective and incapable of accounting for the varying extents
of damage within an image. Addressing these limitations, this study proposes a
novel approach by framing damage severity assessment as a semantic segmentation
problem, aiming for a more objective analysis of damage in earthquake-affected
areas. The methodology involves the construction of a segmented damage severity
dataset, categorizing damage into three degrees: undamaged structures, damaged
structures, and debris. Utilizing this dataset, the study fine-tunes a
SegFormer model to generate damage severity segmentations for post-earthquake
social media images. Furthermore, a new damage severity scoring system is
introduced, quantifying damage by considering the varying degrees of damage
across different areas within images, adjusted for depth estimation. The
application of this approach allows for the quantification of damage severity
in social media images in a more objective and comprehensive manner. By
providing a nuanced understanding of damage, this study enhances the ability to
offer precise guidance to disaster reconnaissance teams, facilitating more
effective and targeted response efforts in the aftermath of earthquakes.

Abstract: The rapid growth of online video content, especially on short video

that can condense long-form videos into concise and engaging clips. Existing
automatic editing methods predominantly rely on textual cues from ASR

context and leading to incoherent outputs. In this paper, we propose a
human-inspired automatic video editing framework (HIVE) that leverages
multimodal narrative understanding to address these limitations. Our approach
incorporates character extraction, dialogue analysis, and narrative
summarization through multimodal large language models, enabling a holistic
understanding of the video content. To further enhance coherence, we apply
scene-level segmentation and decompose the editing process into three subtasks:
highlight detection, opening/ending selection, and pruning of irrelevant
content. To facilitate research in this area, we introduce DramaAD, a novel
benchmark dataset comprising over 800 short drama episodes and 500
professionally edited advertisement clips. Experimental results demonstrate
that our framework consistently outperforms existing baselines across both
general and advertisement-oriented editing tasks, significantly narrowing the
quality gap between automatic and human-edited videos.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have shown remarkable success in
generating high-quality images from text prompts. Recent efforts extend these
models to incorporate conditional images (e.g., depth or pose maps) for
fine-grained spatial control. Among them, feature injection methods have
emerged as a training-free alternative to traditional fine-tuning approaches.
However, they often suffer from structural misalignment, condition leakage, and
visual artifacts, especially when the condition image diverges significantly
from natural RGB distributions. By revisiting existing methods, we identify a
core limitation: the synchronous injection of condition features fails to
account for the trade-off between domain alignment and structural preservation
during denoising. Inspired by this observation, we propose a flexible feature
injection framework that decouples the injection timestep from the denoising
process. At its core is a structure-rich injection module, which enables the
model to better adapt to the evolving interplay between alignment and structure
preservation throughout the diffusion steps, resulting in more faithful
structural generation. In addition, we introduce appearance-rich prompting and
a restart refinement strategy to further enhance appearance control and visual
quality. Together, these designs enable training-free generation that is both
structure-rich and appearance-rich. Extensive experiments show that our
approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse zero-shot
conditioning scenarios.

Abstract: The performance of image segmentation models has historically been
constrained by the high cost of collecting large-scale annotated data. The
Segment Anything Model (SAM) alleviates this original problem through a
promptable, semantics-agnostic, segmentation paradigm and yet still requires
manual visual-prompts or complex domain-dependent prompt-generation rules to
process a new image. Towards reducing this new burden, our work investigates
the task of object segmentation when provided with, alternatively, only a small
set of reference images. Our key insight is to leverage strong semantic priors,
as learned by foundation models, to identify corresponding regions between a
reference and a target image. We find that correspondences enable automatic
generation of instance-level segmentation masks for downstream tasks and
instantiate our ideas via a multi-stage, training-free method incorporating (1)
memory bank construction; (2) representation aggregation and (3) semantic-aware
feature matching. Our experiments show significant improvements on segmentation
metrics, leading to state-of-the-art performance on COCO FSOD (36.8% nAP),
PASCAL VOC Few-Shot (71.2% nAP50) and outperforming existing training-free
approaches on the Cross-Domain FSOD benchmark (22.4% nAP).

Conclusion: LangScene-X为稀疏视图下的3D重建和场景理解提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recovering 3D structures with open-vocabulary scene understanding from 2D
images is a fundamental but daunting task. Recent developments have achieved
this by performing per-scene optimization with embedded language information.
However, they heavily rely on the calibrated dense-view reconstruction
paradigm, thereby suffering from severe rendering artifacts and implausible
semantic synthesis when limited views are available. In this paper, we
introduce a novel generative framework, coined LangScene-X, to unify and
generate 3D consistent multi-modality information for reconstruction and
understanding. Powered by the generative capability of creating more consistent
novel observations, we can build generalizable 3D language-embedded scenes from
only sparse views. Specifically, we first train a TriMap video diffusion model
that can generate appearance (RGBs), geometry (normals), and semantics
(segmentation maps) from sparse inputs through progressive knowledge
integration. Furthermore, we propose a Language Quantized Compressor (LQC),
trained on large-scale image datasets, to efficiently encode language
embeddings, enabling cross-scene generalization without per-scene retraining.
Finally, we reconstruct the language surface fields by aligning language
information onto the surface of 3D scenes, enabling open-ended language
queries. Extensive experiments on real-world data demonstrate the superiority
of our LangScene-X over state-of-the-art methods in terms of quality and
generalizability. Project Page: https://liuff19.github.io/LangScene-X.

Result: 通过消融实验和四个公开基准数据集的对比实验验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: DCDP-HAR框架在多模态HAR中表现出色，解决了关键问题。

Abstract: Sensor-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a core technology that
enables intelligent systems to perceive and interact with their environment.
However, multimodal HAR systems still encounter key challenges, such as
difficulties in cross-modal feature alignment and imbalanced modality
contributions. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework called the
Dynamic Contrastive Dual-Path Network (DCDP-HAR). The framework comprises three
key components. First, a dual-path feature extraction architecture is employed,
where ResNet and DenseNet branches collaboratively process multimodal sensor
data. Second, a multi-stage contrastive learning mechanism is introduced to
achieve progressive alignment from local perception to semantic abstraction.
Third, we present a confidence-driven gradient modulation strategy that
dynamically monitors and adjusts the learning intensity of each modality branch
during backpropagation, effectively alleviating modality competition. In
addition, a momentum-based gradient accumulation strategy is adopted to enhance
training stability. We conduct ablation studies to validate the effectiveness
of each component and perform extensive comparative experiments on four public
benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: USAD方法有效解决了HAR的关键问题，并在实际部署中验证了其高效性和可行性。

Abstract: The primary objective of human activity recognition (HAR) is to infer ongoing
human actions from sensor data, a task that finds broad applications in health
monitoring, safety protection, and sports analysis. Despite proliferating
research, HAR still faces key challenges, including the scarcity of labeled
samples for rare activities, insufficient extraction of high-level features,
and suboptimal model performance on lightweight devices. To address these
issues, this paper proposes a comprehensive optimization approach centered on
multi-attention interaction mechanisms. First, an unsupervised,
statistics-guided diffusion model is employed to perform data augmentation,
thereby alleviating the problems of labeled data scarcity and severe class
imbalance. Second, a multi-branch spatio-temporal interaction network is
designed, which captures multi-scale features of sequential data through
parallel residual branches with 3*3, 5*5, and 7*7 convolutional kernels.
Simultaneously, temporal attention mechanisms are incorporated to identify
critical time points, while spatial attention enhances inter-sensor
interactions. A cross-branch feature fusion unit is further introduced to
improve the overall feature representation capability. Finally, an adaptive
multi-loss function fusion strategy is integrated, allowing for dynamic
adjustment of loss weights and overall model optimization. Experimental results
on three public datasets, WISDM, PAMAP2, and OPPORTUNITY, demonstrate that the
proposed unsupervised data augmentation spatio-temporal attention diffusion
network (USAD) achieves accuracies of 98.84%, 93.81%, and 80.92% respectively,
significantly outperforming existing approaches. Furthermore, practical
deployment on embedded devices verifies the efficiency and feasibility of the
proposed method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉模态的安全漏洞研究主要将视觉信息作为触发不安全行为的工具，缺乏现实场景的语义基础。本文旨在定义视觉中心越狱场景，并开发更有效的攻击方法。

Method: 提出VisCo攻击，采用四种视觉策略构建上下文对话，动态生成辅助图像，并结合自动毒性模糊和语义优化生成攻击提示。

Result: VisCo在MM-SafetyBench上对GPT-4o的毒性评分为4.78，攻击成功率为85%，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: VisCo攻击展示了视觉中心越狱场景的可行性，为MLLMs的安全性研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: With the emergence of strong visual-language capabilities, multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated tremendous potential for real-world
applications. However, the security vulnerabilities exhibited by the visual
modality pose significant challenges to deploying such models in open-world
environments. Recent studies have successfully induced harmful responses from
target MLLMs by encoding harmful textual semantics directly into visual inputs.
However, in these approaches, the visual modality primarily serves as a trigger
for unsafe behavior, often exhibiting semantic ambiguity and lacking grounding
in realistic scenarios. In this work, we define a novel setting: visual-centric
jailbreak, where visual information serves as a necessary component in
constructing a complete and realistic jailbreak context. Building on this
setting, we propose the VisCo (Visual Contextual) Attack. VisCo fabricates
contextual dialogue using four distinct visual-focused strategies, dynamically
generating auxiliary images when necessary to construct a visual-centric
jailbreak scenario. To maximize attack effectiveness, it incorporates automatic
toxicity obfuscation and semantic refinement to produce a final attack prompt
that reliably triggers harmful responses from the target black-box MLLMs.
Specifically, VisCo achieves a toxicity score of 4.78 and an Attack Success
Rate (ASR) of 85% on MM-SafetyBench against GPT-4o, significantly outperforming
the baseline, which performs a toxicity score of 2.48 and an ASR of 22.2%. The

Result: 实验表明AnyI2V在空间和运动控制的视频生成中表现优异，支持混合输入和风格编辑。

Conclusion: AnyI2V为视频生成提供了更灵活和多功能的新方法，代码已开源。

Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation, particularly in diffusion models,
have driven notable progress in text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V)
synthesis. However, challenges remain in effectively integrating dynamic motion
signals and flexible spatial constraints. Existing T2V methods typically rely
on text prompts, which inherently lack precise control over the spatial layout
of generated content. In contrast, I2V methods are limited by their dependence
on real images, which restricts the editability of the synthesized content.
Although some methods incorporate ControlNet to introduce image-based
conditioning, they often lack explicit motion control and require
computationally expensive training. To address these limitations, we propose
AnyI2V, a training-free framework that animates any conditional images with
user-defined motion trajectories. AnyI2V supports a broader range of modalities
as the conditional image, including data types such as meshes and point clouds
that are not supported by ControlNet, enabling more flexible and versatile
video generation. Additionally, it supports mixed conditional inputs and
enables style transfer and editing via LoRA and text prompts. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed AnyI2V achieves superior performance
and provides a new perspective in spatial- and motion-controlled video
generation. Code is available at https://henghuiding.com/AnyI2V/.

Result: 在五种专业视觉任务上，GCoT显著优于微调和蒸馏方法。

Conclusion: GCoT能有效提升MLLM在数据有限情况下对专业视觉任务的适应能力。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in interpreting images using natural language. However, without
using large-scale datasets for retraining, these models are difficult to adapt
to specialized vision tasks, e.g., chart understanding. This problem is caused
by a mismatch between pre-training and downstream datasets: pre-training
datasets primarily concentrate on scenes and objects but contain limited
information about specialized, non-object images, such as charts and tables. In
this paper, we share an interesting finding that training an MLLM with
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning data can facilitate model adaptation in
specialized vision tasks, especially under data-limited regimes. However, we
identify a critical issue within CoT data distilled from pre-trained MLLMs,
i.e., the data often contains multiple factual errors in the reasoning steps.
To address the problem, we propose Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT), a simple
bootstrapping-based approach that aims to inject grounding information (i.e.,
bounding boxes) into CoT data, essentially making the reasoning steps more
faithful to input images. We evaluate our approach on five specialized vision
tasks, which cover a variety of visual formats including charts, tables,
receipts, and reports. The results demonstrate that under data-limited regimes
our approach significantly improves upon fine-tuning and distillation.

Conclusion: EasyCache为高质量视频生成提供了高效且易用的解决方案，适用于研究和实际应用。

Abstract: Video generation models have demonstrated remarkable performance, yet their
broader adoption remains constrained by slow inference speeds and substantial
computational costs, primarily due to the iterative nature of the denoising
process. Addressing this bottleneck is essential for democratizing advanced
video synthesis technologies and enabling their integration into real-world
applications. This work proposes EasyCache, a training-free acceleration
framework for video diffusion models. EasyCache introduces a lightweight,
runtime-adaptive caching mechanism that dynamically reuses previously computed
transformation vectors, avoiding redundant computations during inference.
Unlike prior approaches, EasyCache requires no offline profiling,
pre-computation, or extensive parameter tuning. We conduct comprehensive
studies on various large-scale video generation models, including OpenSora,
Wan2.1, and HunyuanVideo. Our method achieves leading acceleration performance,
reducing inference time by up to 2.1-3.3$\times$ compared to the original
baselines while maintaining high visual fidelity with a significant up to 36%
PSNR improvement compared to the previous SOTA method. This improvement makes
our EasyCache a efficient and highly accessible solution for high-quality video
generation in both research and practical applications. The code is available

Conclusion: RefTok通过高效捕捉时间动态和冗余性，显著提升了视频模型的性能。

Abstract: Effectively handling temporal redundancy remains a key challenge in learning
video models. Prevailing approaches often treat each set of frames
independently, failing to effectively capture the temporal dependencies and
redundancies inherent in videos. To address this limitation, we introduce
RefTok, a novel reference-based tokenization method capable of capturing
complex temporal dynamics and contextual information. Our method encodes and
decodes sets of frames conditioned on an unquantized reference frame. When
decoded, RefTok preserves the continuity of motion and the appearance of
objects across frames. For example, RefTok retains facial details despite head
motion, reconstructs text correctly, preserves small patterns, and maintains
the legibility of handwriting from the context. Across 4 video datasets (K600,
UCF-101, BAIR Robot Pushing, and DAVIS), RefTok significantly outperforms
current state-of-the-art tokenizers (Cosmos and MAGVIT) and improves all
evaluated metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) by an average of 36.7% at the same or
higher compression ratios. When a video generation model is trained using
RefTok's latents on the BAIR Robot Pushing task, the generations not only
outperform MAGVIT-B but the larger MAGVIT-L, which has 4x more parameters,
across all generation metrics by an average of 27.9%.

Conclusion: Point3R通过显式指针内存和高效融合机制，显著提升了密集3D重建的性能和效率。

Abstract: Dense 3D scene reconstruction from an ordered sequence or unordered image
collections is a critical step when bringing research in computer vision into
practical scenarios. Following the paradigm introduced by DUSt3R, which unifies
an image pair densely into a shared coordinate system, subsequent methods
maintain an implicit memory to achieve dense 3D reconstruction from more
images. However, such implicit memory is limited in capacity and may suffer
from information loss of earlier frames. We propose Point3R, an online
framework targeting dense streaming 3D reconstruction. To be specific, we
maintain an explicit spatial pointer memory directly associated with the 3D
structure of the current scene. Each pointer in this memory is assigned a
specific 3D position and aggregates scene information nearby in the global
coordinate system into a changing spatial feature. Information extracted from
the latest frame interacts explicitly with this pointer memory, enabling dense
integration of the current observation into the global coordinate system. We
design a 3D hierarchical position embedding to promote this interaction and
design a simple yet effective fusion mechanism to ensure that our pointer
memory is uniform and efficient. Our method achieves competitive or
state-of-the-art performance on various tasks with low training costs. Code is

Abstract: This paper presents a novel motion feature guided diffusion model for
unpaired video-to-video translation (MFD-V2V), designed to synthesize dynamic,
high-contrast cine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) from lower-contrast,
artifact-prone displacement encoding with stimulated echoes (DENSE) CMR

Spatio-Temporal Motion Encoder (STME) to extract fine-grained motion
conditioning, is then developed to improve synthesis quality and fidelity. We
evaluate our method, MFD-V2V, on a comprehensive cardiac dataset, demonstrating
superior performance over the state-of-the-art in both quantitative metrics and
qualitative assessments. Furthermore, we show the benefits of our synthesized
cine CMRs improving downstream clinical and analytical tasks, underscoring the

Conclusion: CineMyoPS为MI风险分层和预后评估提供了一种高效的无对比剂解决方案。

Abstract: Myocardial infarction (MI) is a leading cause of death worldwide. Late
gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and T2-weighted cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)
imaging can respectively identify scarring and edema areas, both of which are
essential for MI risk stratification and prognosis assessment. Although
combining complementary information from multi-sequence CMR is useful,
acquiring these sequences can be time-consuming and prohibitive, e.g., due to
the administration of contrast agents. Cine CMR is a rapid and contrast-free
imaging technique that can visualize both motion and structural abnormalities
of the myocardium induced by acute MI. Therefore, we present a new end-to-end
deep neural network, referred to as CineMyoPS, to segment myocardial
pathologies, \ie scars and edema, solely from cine CMR images. Specifically,
CineMyoPS extracts both motion and anatomy features associated with MI. Given
the interdependence between these features, we design a consistency loss
(resembling the co-training strategy) to facilitate their joint learning.
Furthermore, we propose a time-series aggregation strategy to integrate
MI-related features across the cardiac cycle, thereby enhancing segmentation
accuracy for myocardial pathologies. Experimental results on a multi-center
dataset demonstrate that CineMyoPS achieves promising performance in myocardial
pathology segmentation, motion estimation, and anatomy segmentation.

Conclusion: FC-DLIF为非侵入性输入函数预测提供了可靠且灵活的方法，适用于动态小动物PET研究。

Abstract: Dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) and kinetic modeling are pivotal
in advancing tracer development research in small animal studies. Accurate
kinetic modeling requires precise input function estimation, traditionally
achieved via arterial blood sampling. However, arterial cannulation in small
animals like mice, involves intricate, time-consuming, and terminal procedures,
precluding longitudinal studies. This work proposes a non-invasive, fully
convolutional deep learning-based approach (FC-DLIF) to predict input functions
directly from PET imaging, potentially eliminating the need for blood sampling
in dynamic small-animal PET. The proposed FC-DLIF model includes a spatial
feature extractor acting on the volumetric time frames of the PET sequence,
extracting spatial features. These are subsequently further processed in a
temporal feature extractor that predicts the arterial input function. The
proposed approach is trained and evaluated using images and arterial blood
curves from [$^{18}$F]FDG data using cross validation. Further, the model
applicability is evaluated on imaging data and arterial blood curves collected
using two additional radiotracers ([$^{18}$F]FDOPA, and [$^{68}$Ga]PSMA). The
model was further evaluated on data truncated and shifted in time, to simulate
shorter, and shifted, PET scans. The proposed FC-DLIF model reliably predicts
the arterial input function with respect to mean squared error and correlation.
Furthermore, the FC-DLIF model is able to predict the arterial input function
even from truncated and shifted samples. The model fails to predict the AIF
from samples collected using different radiotracers, as these are not
represented in the training data. Our deep learning-based input function offers
a non-invasive and reliable alternative to arterial blood sampling, proving
robust and flexible to temporal shifts and different scan durations.

TL;DR: 提出一种从2D超声切片重建个性化3D心脏解剖的创新框架，显著提升左心室和右心室体积估计的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 2D超声成像在心脏疾病临床实践中存在局限性，难以准确估计临床参数如左心室体积，而3D超声成像又受限于分辨率和手动标注的高要求。

Method: 设计了一种新颖的3D重建流程，通过交替优化2D切片的3D姿态估计和基于隐式神经网络的3D切片整合，逐步将先验3D心脏形状转化为个性化3D模型。

Result: 使用六个平面时，重建的3D心脏显著提高了左心室体积估计的准确性（误差1.98% vs. 20.24%），并首次实现了从2D切片估计右心室体积（误差5.75%）。

Conclusion: 该研究为心脏超声的个性化3D结构和功能分析提供了新方法，具有重要的临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Echocardiography (echo) plays an indispensable role in the clinical practice
of heart diseases. However, ultrasound imaging typically provides only
two-dimensional (2D) cross-sectional images from a few specific views, making
it challenging to interpret and inaccurate for estimation of clinical
parameters like the volume of left ventricle (LV). 3D ultrasound imaging
provides an alternative for 3D quantification, but is still limited by the low
spatial and temporal resolution and the highly demanding manual delineation.
  To address these challenges, we propose an innovative framework for
reconstructing personalized 3D heart anatomy from 2D echo slices that are
frequently used in clinical practice. Specifically, a novel 3D reconstruction
pipeline is designed, which alternatively optimizes between the 3D pose
estimation of these 2D slices and the 3D integration of these slices using an
implicit neural network, progressively transforming a prior 3D heart shape into
a personalized 3D heart model.
  We validate the method with two datasets. When six planes are used, the
reconstructed 3D heart can lead to a significant improvement for LV volume
estimation over the bi-plane method (error in percent: 1.98\% VS. 20.24\%). In
addition, the whole reconstruction framework makes even an important
breakthrough that can estimate RV volume from 2D echo slices (with an error of
5.75\% ). This study provides a new way for personalized 3D structure and
function analysis from cardiac ultrasound and is of great potential in clinical
practice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结直肠息肉分割对早期癌症检测至关重要，但现有方法在弱对比度边界下表现不佳，需要更精确的边缘提取方法。

Method: 提出MEGANet-W，结合Haar小波边缘图和注意力模块，通过无参数的多方向边缘提取和特征融合提升分割效果。

Result: 在五个公开数据集上，MEGANet-W显著优于现有方法，mIoU提升2.3%，mDice提升1.2%。

Conclusion: MEGANet-W通过小波边缘引导和注意力机制，无需额外参数即可显著提升分割性能。

Abstract: Colorectal polyp segmentation is critical for early detection of colorectal
cancer, yet weak and low contrast boundaries significantly limit automated
accuracy. Existing deep models either blur fine edge details or rely on
handcrafted filters that perform poorly under variable imaging conditions. We
propose MEGANet-W, a Wavelet Driven Edge Guided Attention Network that injects
directional, parameter free Haar wavelet edge maps into each decoder stage to
recalibrate semantic features. Our two main contributions are: (1) a two-level
Haar wavelet head for multi orientation edge extraction; and (2) Wavelet Edge
Guided Attention (WEGA) modules that fuse wavelet cues with reverse and input
branches. On five public polyp datasets, MEGANetW consistently outperforms
existing methods, improving mIoU by up to 2.3% and mDice by 1.2%, while
introducing no additional learnable parameters.

Result: 实现了传统3D网格在高斯场景中的逼真反射映射。

Conclusion: GBake有效解决了高斯场景与传统网格的集成问题，提升了视觉效果。

Abstract: The growing popularity of 3D Gaussian Splatting has created the need to
integrate traditional computer graphics techniques and assets in splatted
environments. Since 3D Gaussian primitives encode lighting and geometry jointly
as appearance, meshes are relit improperly when inserted directly in a mixture
of 3D Gaussians and thus appear noticeably out of place. We introduce GBake, a
specialized tool for baking reflection probes from Gaussian-splatted scenes
that enables realistic reflection mapping of traditional 3D meshes in the Unity
game engine.

Conclusion: 该方法在实时渲染中高效且接近真实效果，仅需双倍内存存储预滤波环境贴图。

Abstract: Image-based lighting is a widely used technique to reproduce shading under
real-world lighting conditions, especially in real-time rendering applications.
A particularly challenging scenario involves materials exhibiting a sparkling
or glittering appearance, caused by discrete microfacets scattered across their
surface. In this paper, we propose an efficient approximation for image-based
lighting of glints, enabling fully dynamic material properties and environment
maps. Our novel approach is grounded in real-time glint rendering under area
light illumination and employs standard environment map filtering techniques.
Crucially, our environment map filtering process is sufficiently fast to be
executed on a per-frame basis. Our method assumes that the environment map is
partitioned into few homogeneous regions of constant radiance. By filtering the
corresponding indicator functions with the normal distribution function, we
obtain the probabilities for individual microfacets to reflect light from each
region. During shading, these probabilities are utilized to hierarchically
sample a multinomial distribution, facilitated by our novel dual-gated Gaussian
approximation of binomial distributions. We validate that our real-time
approximation is close to ground-truth renderings for a range of material
properties and lighting conditions, and demonstrate robust and stable
performance, with little overhead over rendering glints from a single
directional light. Compared to rendering smooth materials without glints, our
approach requires twice as much memory to store the prefiltered environment
map.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地震相关现象（如地震波和地壳形变）影响广泛区域，需要大规模建模并处理人工边界问题。PINNs已用于分析波前传播和半无限域中的形变，但尚未充分应用于三维地壳形变建模。

Method: 研究构建了四个神经网络，分别表示断层表面及其延伸的两个子域中的位移和应力场，以提高建模精度。

Result: 正向模拟显示内部形变精度高，但对刚性运动的约束存在误差。反演分析中，利用地表观测数据估计了断层滑动分布，应用于2008年岩手-宫城内陆地震数据，结果与先前研究一致，但震级低估。

Conclusion: PINNs能够有效分析三维地壳形变，为基于实际观测和地壳结构的大规模地震建模提供了灵活方法。

Abstract: Earthquake-related phenomena such as seismic waves and crustal deformation
impact broad regions, requiring large-scale modeling with careful treatment of
artificial outer boundaries. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have been
applied to analyze wavefront propagation, acoustic and elastic waveform
propagations, and crustal deformation in semi-infinite domains. In this study,
we investigated the capability of PINNs for modeling earthquake crustal
deformation in 3-D structures. To improve modeling accuracy, four neural
networks were constructed to represent the displacement and stress fields in
two subdomains divided by a fault surface and its extension. Forward
simulations exhibited high accuracy for internal deformation but yielded errors
for rigid motions, underscoring the inherent difficulty in constraining static
deformation at an infinite distance. In the inversion analysis, fault slip
distributions were estimated using surface observational data. Application to
real data from the 2008 Iwate-Miyagi inland earthquake showed a fault slip
consistent with previous studies, despite underestimation of the magnitude.
This study demonstrates the capability of PINNs to analyze 3-D crustal
deformation, thereby offering a flexible approach for large-scale earthquake
modeling using real-world observations and crustal structures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习在医学影像中因数据稀缺和隐私法规导致的局限性，以及联邦学习的高通信成本和单一任务限制。

Method: 采用差分隐私条件变分自编码器（DP-CVAE）建模全局隐私感知数据分布，通过基础模型提取紧凑嵌入。

Result: 方法在隐私性、可扩展性和效率上优于传统联邦学习分类器，且DP-CVAE比DP-CGAN生成更高保真度的嵌入，参数减少5倍。

Conclusion: 该方法为医学影像中的隐私保护和高效数据共享提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) has revolutionized medical imaging, yet its adoption is
constrained by data scarcity and privacy regulations, limiting access to
diverse datasets. Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized training but
suffers from high communication costs and is often restricted to a single
downstream task, reducing flexibility. We propose a data-sharing method via
Differentially Private (DP) generative models. By adopting foundation models,
we extract compact, informative embeddings, reducing redundancy and lowering
computational overhead. Clients collaboratively train a Differentially Private
Conditional Variational Autoencoder (DP-CVAE) to model a global, privacy-aware
data distribution, supporting diverse downstream tasks. Our approach, validated
across multiple feature extractors, enhances privacy, scalability, and
efficiency, outperforming traditional FL classifiers while ensuring
differential privacy. Additionally, DP-CVAE produces higher-fidelity embeddings
than DP-CGAN while requiring $5{\times}$ fewer parameters.

Motivation: 现有推理方法存在局限性（如模态或问题特定性、需要额外监督），论文探索是否可以通过无监督学习实现通用的System 2 Thinking能力。

Method: 训练EBTs（基于能量的模型），通过能量最小化优化输入与候选预测的兼容性，实现推理。

Result: EBTs在训练和推理中表现优于Transformer++和Diffusion Transformers，数据扩展率提升35%，语言任务性能提升29%，图像去噪效果更优。

Conclusion: EBTs是一种有前景的新范式，可提升模型的学习和推理能力。

Abstract: Inference-time computation techniques, analogous to human System 2 Thinking,
have recently become popular for improving model performances. However, most
existing approaches suffer from several limitations: they are modality-specific
(e.g., working only in text), problem-specific (e.g., verifiable domains like
math and coding), or require additional supervision/training on top of
unsupervised pretraining (e.g., verifiers or verifiable rewards). In this
paper, we ask the question "Is it possible to generalize these System 2
Thinking approaches, and develop models that learn to think solely from
unsupervised learning?" Interestingly, we find the answer is yes, by learning
to explicitly verify the compatibility between inputs and
candidate-predictions, and then re-framing prediction problems as optimization
with respect to this verifier. Specifically, we train Energy-Based Transformers
(EBTs) -- a new class of Energy-Based Models (EBMs) -- to assign an energy
value to every input and candidate-prediction pair, enabling predictions
through gradient descent-based energy minimization until convergence. Across
both discrete (text) and continuous (visual) modalities, we find EBTs scale
faster than the dominant Transformer++ approach during training, achieving an
up to 35% higher scaling rate with respect to data, batch size, parameters,
FLOPs, and depth. During inference, EBTs improve performance with System 2
Thinking by 29% more than the Transformer++ on language tasks, and EBTs
outperform Diffusion Transformers on image denoising while using fewer forward
passes. Further, we find that EBTs achieve better results than existing models
on most downstream tasks given the same or worse pretraining performance,
suggesting that EBTs generalize better than existing approaches. Consequently,
EBTs are a promising new paradigm for scaling both the learning and thinking
capabilities of models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型在条件设置下表现优异，但可控性和重建精度限制了其实际应用。

Method: 使用变分自编码器和条件扩散模型，仅压缩少量关键帧并通过生成插值重建其余帧。

Result: 在多个数据集上，压缩比提升10倍，性能比领先学习方法高63%。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持高重建精度的同时显著降低了存储成本。

Abstract: Generative models have demonstrated strong performance in conditional
settings and can be viewed as a form of data compression, where the condition
serves as a compact representation. However, their limited controllability and
reconstruction accuracy restrict their practical application to data
compression. In this work, we propose an efficient latent diffusion framework
that bridges this gap by combining a variational autoencoder with a conditional
diffusion model. Our method compresses only a small number of keyframes into
latent space and uses them as conditioning inputs to reconstruct the remaining
frames via generative interpolation, eliminating the need to store latent
representations for every frame. This approach enables accurate spatiotemporal
reconstruction while significantly reducing storage costs. Experimental results
across multiple datasets show that our method achieves up to 10 times higher
compression ratios than rule-based state-of-the-art compressors such as SZ3,
and up to 63 percent better performance than leading learning-based methods
under the same reconstruction error.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统持续学习方法假设数据分布静态，忽略了现实数据流中的概念漂移，需要兼顾稳定性和快速适应性。

Method: 提出AMR方法，通过选择性移除过时样本并补充新样本，调整记忆缓冲区以匹配新分布。

Result: AMR在多个数据集上表现优异，接近完全重新学习的效果，但显著降低了标注和计算成本。

Conclusion: AMR是一种可扩展的解决方案，能在非静态环境中平衡稳定性和可塑性。

Abstract: Traditional continual learning methods prioritize knowledge retention and
focus primarily on mitigating catastrophic forgetting, implicitly assuming that
the data distribution of previously learned tasks remains static. This
overlooks the dynamic nature of real-world data streams, where concept drift
permanently alters previously seen data and demands both stability and rapid
adaptation.
  We introduce a holistic framework for continual learning under concept drift
that simulates realistic scenarios by evolving task distributions. As a
baseline, we consider Full Relearning (FR), in which the model is retrained
from scratch on newly labeled samples from the drifted distribution. While
effective, this approach incurs substantial annotation and computational
overhead. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Memory Realignment
(AMR), a lightweight alternative that equips rehearsal-based learners with a
drift-aware adaptation mechanism. AMR selectively removes outdated samples of
drifted classes from the replay buffer and repopulates it with a small number
of up-to-date instances, effectively realigning memory with the new
distribution. This targeted resampling matches the performance of FR while
reducing the need for labeled data and computation by orders of magnitude.
  To enable reproducible evaluation, we introduce four concept-drift variants
of standard vision benchmarks: Fashion-MNIST-CD, CIFAR10-CD, CIFAR100-CD, and
Tiny-ImageNet-CD, where previously seen classes reappear with shifted
representations. Comprehensive experiments on these datasets using several
rehearsal-based baselines show that AMR consistently counters concept drift,
maintaining high accuracy with minimal overhead. These results position AMR as
a scalable solution that reconciles stability and plasticity in non-stationary
continual learning environments.

Result: 实验表明L-VAE在重建和解耦间取得有效平衡，性能优于或接近多种VAE变体。

Conclusion: L-VAE在多个数据集上表现优异，成功解耦面部属性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel model called Learnable VAE (L-VAE), which
learns a disentangled representation together with the hyperparameters of the
cost function. L-VAE can be considered as an extension of \b{eta}-VAE, wherein
the hyperparameter, \b{eta}, is empirically adjusted. L-VAE mitigates the
limitations of \b{eta}-VAE by learning the relative weights of the terms in the
loss function to control the dynamic trade-off between disentanglement and
reconstruction losses. In the proposed model, the weight of the loss terms and
the parameters of the model architecture are learned concurrently. An
additional regularization term is added to the loss function to prevent bias
towards either reconstruction or disentanglement losses. Experimental analyses
show that the proposed L-VAE finds an effective balance between reconstruction
fidelity and disentangling the latent dimensions. Comparisons of the proposed
L-VAE against \b{eta}-VAE, VAE, ControlVAE, DynamicVAE, and {\sigma}-VAE on
datasets, such as dSprites, MPI3D-complex, Falcor3D, and Isaac3D reveals that
L-VAE consistently provides the best or the second best performances measured
by a set of disentanglement metrics. Moreover, qualitative experiments on
CelebA dataset, confirm the success of the L-VAE model for disentangling the
facial attributes.

Result: 在三个跨域基准测试中，DAID在公平性和泛化性上均优于现有检测器。

Conclusion: DAID通过控制混杂变量，验证了公平性干预可提升泛化性，为深度伪造检测提供了理论和实践支持。

Abstract: Deepfake detection models face two critical challenges: generalization to
unseen manipulations and demographic fairness among population groups. However,
existing approaches often demonstrate that these two objectives are inherently
conflicting, revealing a trade-off between them. In this paper, we, for the
first time, uncover and formally define a causal relationship between fairness
and generalization. Building on the back-door adjustment, we show that
controlling for confounders (data distribution and model capacity) enables
improved generalization via fairness interventions. Motivated by this insight,
we propose Demographic Attribute-insensitive Intervention Detection (DAID), a
plug-and-play framework composed of: i) Demographic-aware data rebalancing,
which employs inverse-propensity weighting and subgroup-wise feature
normalization to neutralize distributional biases; and ii) Demographic-agnostic
feature aggregation, which uses a novel alignment loss to suppress
sensitive-attribute signals. Across three cross-domain benchmarks, DAID
consistently achieves superior performance in both fairness and generalization
compared to several state-of-the-art detectors, validating both its theoretical
foundation and practical effectiveness.

Method: 使用人类脐静脉内皮细胞培养，通过tubuleTracker、ImageJ和手动分析比较关键指标（如管状计数、总长度等），并评估血管生成成熟度。

Result: tubuleTracker分析时间最短（6秒/图像），且其指标（如管状计数、长度等）与血管生成成熟度显著相关。

Conclusion: tubuleTracker在速度和一致性上优于手动和ImageJ分析，尤其适用于量化血管生成成熟度，并作为免费软件提供给生物医学研究社区。

Abstract: Background: In vitro endothelial cell culture is widely used to study
angiogenesis. Histomicrographic images of cell networks are often analyzed
manually, a process that is time-consuming and subjective. Automated tools like
ImageJ (NIH) can assist, but are often slow and inaccurate. Additionally, as
endothelial networks grow more complex, traditional architectural metrics may
not fully reflect network maturity. To address these limitations, we developed
tubuleTracker, a software tool that quantifies endothelial network architecture
and maturity rapidly and objectively. Methods: Human umbilical vein endothelial
cells were cultured in an extracellular matrix, and 54 images were acquired
using phase contrast microscopy. Each image was analyzed manually by three
independent reviewers, and by both ImageJ and tubuleTracker. Key metrics
included tubule count, total length, node count, tubule area, and vessel
circularity. In parallel, trained scientists rated each image for angiogenesis
maturity on a 1-5 scale (1 = most mature). Results: Analysis time per image
differed significantly: manual (8 min), ImageJ (58+/-4 s), and tubuleTracker
(6+/-2 s) (p<0.0001). Significant differences were also found in tubule count
(manual 168+/-SD, tubuleTracker 92+/-SD, ImageJ 433+/-SD), length, and node
count (all p<0.0001). tubuleTracker's metrics varied significantly across
angiogenesis maturity scores, including tubule count, length, node count, area,
and circularity (all p<0.0001). Conclusions: tubuleTracker was faster and more
consistent than both manual and ImageJ-based analysis. Vessel circularity
proved especially effective in capturing angiogenesis maturity. tubuleTracker
is available as free shareware for the biomedical research community.

Conclusion: 运动不仅是行为的体现，更是智能系统与世界互动的窗口，应成为AI建模的重点。

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have dramatically improved our ability to
model language, vision, and other high-dimensional data, yet they continue to
struggle with one of the most fundamental aspects of biological systems:
movement. Across neuroscience, medicine, robotics, and ethology, movement is
essential for interpreting behavior, predicting intent, and enabling
interaction. Despite its core significance in our intelligence, movement is
often treated as an afterthought rather than as a rich and structured modality
in its own right. This reflects a deeper fragmentation in how movement data is
collected and modeled, often constrained by task-specific goals and
domain-specific assumptions. But movement is not domain-bound. It reflects
shared physical constraints, conserved morphological structures, and purposeful
dynamics that cut across species and settings. We argue that movement should be
treated as a primary modeling target for AI. It is inherently structured and
grounded in embodiment and physics. This structure, often allowing for compact,
lower-dimensional representations (e.g., pose), makes it more interpretable and
computationally tractable to model than raw, high-dimensional sensory inputs.
Developing models that can learn from and generalize across diverse movement
data will not only advance core capabilities in generative modeling and
control, but also create a shared foundation for understanding behavior across
biological and artificial systems. Movement is not just an outcome, it is a
window into how intelligent systems engage with the world.

Abstract: Neutrinos can serve as a complementary and independent tool to gravitational
and seismic studies in exploring the interior of Earth, thanks to their unique
properties: extremely low interaction cross sections and flavor oscillations.
With the precise measurements of neutrino oscillation parameters and
observation of the non-zero value of mixing angle $\theta_{13}$, it has become
feasible to detect the forward scattering of GeV-energy atmospheric neutrinos
passing through Earth with ambient electrons in the form of matter effects on
neutrino oscillation probabilities. These matter effects depend on both the
neutrino energy and electron density distribution along their path, making them
ideally suited for exploring the inner structure of Earth. Furthermore, in the
presence of non-standard interactions (NSI) of neutrinos with matter,
oscillation patterns undergo additional modifications. In this study, we
quantify the capability of an atmospheric neutrino experiment, such as a
magnetized iron calorimeter detector, to validate the Earth's core and measure
the position of the core-mantle boundary in the presence of NSI. We perform
this study considering a three-layered density profile of Earth. Our analysis
demonstrates that neutrino non-standard interactions impact these Earth
tomography measurements in comparison to standard interactions.

Abstract: In autonomous driving, recent research has increasingly focused on
collaborative perception based on deep learning to overcome the limitations of
individual perception systems. Although these methods achieve high accuracy,
they rely on high communication bandwidth and require unrestricted access to
each agent's object detection model architecture and parameters. These
constraints pose challenges real-world autonomous driving scenarios, where
communication limitations and the need to safeguard proprietary models hinder
practical implementation. To address this issue, we introduce a novel late
collaborative framework for 3D multi-source and multi-object fusion, which
operates solely on shared 3D bounding box attributes-category, size, position,
and orientation-without necessitating direct access to detection models. Our
framework establishes a new state-of-the-art in late fusion, achieving up to
five times lower position error compared to existing methods. Additionally, it
reduces scale error by a factor of 7.5 and orientation error by half, all while
maintaining perfect 100% precision and recall when fusing detections from
heterogeneous perception systems. These results highlight the effectiveness of
our approach in addressing real-world collaborative perception challenges,
setting a new benchmark for efficient and scalable multi-agent fusion.

Abstract: Robotic grasping faces challenges in adapting to objects with varying shapes
and sizes. In this paper, we introduce MISCGrasp, a volumetric grasping method
that integrates multi-scale feature extraction with contrastive feature
enhancement for self-adaptive grasping. We propose a query-based interaction
between high-level and low-level features through the Insight Transformer,
while the Empower Transformer selectively attends to the highest-level
features, which synergistically strikes a balance between focusing on fine
geometric details and overall geometric structures. Furthermore, MISCGrasp
utilizes multi-scale contrastive learning to exploit similarities among
positive grasp samples, ensuring consistency across multi-scale features.
Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate
that MISCGrasp outperforms baseline and variant methods in tabletop
decluttering tasks. More details are available at https://miscgrasp.github.io/.

Abstract: Robots must integrate multiple sensory modalities to act effectively in the
real world. Yet, learning such multimodal policies at scale remains
challenging. Simulation offers a viable solution, but while vision has
benefited from high-fidelity simulators, other modalities (e.g. sound) can be
notoriously difficult to simulate. As a result, sim-to-real transfer has
succeeded primarily in vision-based tasks, with multimodal transfer still
largely unrealized. In this work, we tackle these challenges by introducing
MultiGen, a framework that integrates large-scale generative models into
traditional physics simulators, enabling multisensory simulation. We showcase
our framework on the dynamic task of robot pouring, which inherently relies on
multimodal feedback. By synthesizing realistic audio conditioned on simulation
video, our method enables training on rich audiovisual trajectories -- without
any real robot data. We demonstrate effective zero-shot transfer to real-world
pouring with novel containers and liquids, highlighting the potential of
generative modeling to both simulate hard-to-model modalities and close the
multimodal sim-to-real gap.

Abstract: Domain-Adaptive Pre-training (DAP) has recently gained attention for its
effectiveness in fine-tuning pre-trained models. Building on this, continual
DAP has been explored to develop pre-trained models capable of incrementally
incorporating different domain datasets. However, existing continual DAP
methods face several limitations: (1) high computational cost and GPU memory
usage during training; (2) sensitivity to incremental data order; and (3)
providing a single, generalized model for all end tasks, which contradicts the
essence of DAP. In this paper, we propose DoMIX, a novel approach that
addresses these challenges by leveraging LoRA modules, a representative
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method. Our approach enables efficient
and parallel domain-adaptive pre-training that is robust to domain order and
effectively utilizes accumulated knowledge to provide tailored pre-trained
models for specific tasks. We also demonstrate that our method can be extended
beyond the DAP setting to standard LLM fine-tuning scenarios. Code is available
at https://github.com/dohoonkim-ai/DoMIX.
