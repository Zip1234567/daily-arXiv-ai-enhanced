TL;DR: 海底三维物体检测面临数据稀缺挑战，本文提出两种无需真实训练数据的检测方法：基于合成数据训练的深度学习模型和基于模板匹配的方法。结果显示模板匹配方法在真实数据上表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海底三维物体检测面临真实声纳数据获取困难、成本高、标注复杂的挑战，传统深度学习方法需要大量训练数据。本文探索是否可以在不依赖真实训练数据的情况下实现可靠的海底三维检测。

Method: 提出两种方法：1）基于物理模拟的声纳模拟管线，生成合成训练数据用于先进神经网络训练；2）基于几何先验知识的模型基両模板匹配系统，无需训练。在波罗的海海洞实际测量数据上进行评估。

Result: 合成数据训练的神经网络在模拟场景上达到98% mAP，但在真实声纳数据上下降到40% mAP（域偏移问题）。模板匹配方法在真实数据上达到83% mAP，显示出对声器噪声和环境变化的良好稳健性。

Conclusion: 模板匹配方法在无需训练的情况下在真实海底环境中表现更优，挑战了海洋领域深度学习需要大量数据的传统观念，为自主海底车载导航、海洋考古和离岸基础设施监测开启了新可能性。

Abstract: Underwater 3D object detection remains one of the most challenging frontiers
in computer vision, where traditional approaches struggle with the harsh
acoustic environment and scarcity of training data. While deep learning has
revolutionized terrestrial 3D detection, its application underwater faces a
critical bottleneck: obtaining sufficient annotated sonar data is prohibitively
expensive and logistically complex, often requiring specialized vessels, expert
surveyors, and favorable weather conditions. This work addresses a fundamental
question: Can we achieve reliable underwater 3D object detection without
real-world training data? We tackle this challenge by developing and comparing
two paradigms for training-free detection of artificial structures in multibeam
echo-sounder point clouds. Our dual approach combines a physics-based sonar
simulation pipeline that generates synthetic training data for state-of-the-art
neural networks, with a robust model-based template matching system that
leverages geometric priors of target objects. Evaluation on real bathymetry
surveys from the Baltic Sea reveals surprising insights: while neural networks
trained on synthetic data achieve 98% mean Average Precision (mAP) on simulated
scenes, they drop to 40% mAP on real sonar data due to domain shift.
Conversely, our template matching approach maintains 83% mAP on real data
without requiring any training, demonstrating remarkable robustness to acoustic
noise and environmental variations. Our findings challenge conventional wisdom
about data-hungry deep learning in underwater domains and establish the first
large-scale benchmark for training-free underwater 3D detection. This work
opens new possibilities for autonomous underwater vehicle navigation, marine
archaeology, and offshore infrastructure monitoring in data-scarce environments
where traditional machine learning approaches fail.

*Shudipta Banik,Muna Das,Trapa Banik,Md. Ehsanul Haque*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了MobileDenseAttn模型，通过融合MobileNetV2和DenseNet201双流水线来提高脑网络MRI脑罪瘤检测的准确性、效率和可解释性，在6,020张扩增MRI扫描数据集上达到了98.35%的测试准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有脑罪瘤MRI检测方法存在不是通用、计算效率低、不可解释和缺乏透明度等问题，影响临床信任度。需要一种更高效、可靠且可解释的自动化检测方案。

Method: 提出MobileDenseAttn模型，融合MobileNetV2和DenseNet201的双流水线结构，使用特征层融合技术。在6,020张包含脑组织粒细胞瘤、脑膜瘤、脑下腺瘤和正常样本的MRI扫描数据集上进行训练，采用严格的5折交叉验证协议，并通过GradCAM提供可视化解释。

Result: 模型在训练集上达到99.75%的准确率，测试准确率为98.35%，F1分数为0.9835（95% CI: 0.9743-0.9920）。与基线模型（VGG19、DenseNet201、MobileNetV2）相比，准确率提高了3.67%，训练时间减少39.3%。GradCAM热力图清晰显示了瘤瘤受影响区域。

Conclusion: MobileDenseAttn是一种高效、高性能、可解释的脑罪瘤检测模型，具有强大的临床应用潜力，能够在实际临床环境中提供准确、高效且可信赖的脑罪瘤识别功能。

Abstract: The detection of brain tumor in MRI is an important aspect of ensuring timely
diagnostics and treatment; however, manual analysis is commonly long and
error-prone. Current approaches are not universal because they have limited
generalization to heterogeneous tumors, are computationally inefficient, are
not interpretable, and lack transparency, thus limiting trustworthiness. To
overcome these issues, we introduce MobileDenseAttn, a fusion model of dual
streams of MobileNetV2 and DenseNet201 that can help gradually improve the
feature representation scale, computing efficiency, and visual explanations via
GradCAM. Our model uses feature level fusion and is trained on an augmented
dataset of 6,020 MRI scans representing glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors,
and normal samples. Measured under strict 5-fold cross-validation protocols,
MobileDenseAttn provides a training accuracy of 99.75%, a testing accuracy of
98.35%, and a stable F1 score of 0.9835 (95% CI: 0.9743 to 0.9920). The
extensive validation shows the stability of the model, and the comparative
analysis proves that it is a great advancement over the baseline models (VGG19,
DenseNet201, MobileNetV2) with a +3.67% accuracy increase and a 39.3% decrease
in training time compared to VGG19. The GradCAM heatmaps clearly show
tumor-affected areas, offering clinically significant localization and
improving interpretability. These findings position MobileDenseAttn as an
efficient, high performance, interpretable model with a high probability of
becoming a clinically practical tool in identifying brain tumors in the real
world.

### [3] [Can VLMs Recall Factual Associations From Visual References?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18297)
*Dhananjay Ashok,Ashutosh Chaubey,Hirona J. Arai,Jonathan May,Jesse Thomason*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现视觉语言模型在多模态基础方面存在系统性缺陷：当通过视觉而非文本方式引用实体时，模型回忆事实知识的能力显著下降，准确率降低一半。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别视觉语言模型在多模态基础中的系统性缺陷，特别是模型在将内部实体知识与图像表示链接方面的困难。

Method: 通过控制研究分析VLMs的表现差异，使用内部状态模式探测技术来识别模型不可靠响应的情况，无需重新训练即可应用。

Result: 探测技术在识别VLM失败案例方面达到92%以上的准确率，在视觉问答任务中选择性预测中覆盖度提高7.87%，错误风险降低0.9%。

Conclusion: VLMs存在可检测的系统性缺陷，内部状态探测能有效识别模型不可靠响应，为解决多模态基础问题提供了重要方向和实用建议。

Abstract: Through a controlled study, we identify a systematic deficiency in the
multimodal grounding of Vision Language Models (VLMs). While VLMs can recall
factual associations when provided a textual reference to an entity; their
ability to do so is significantly diminished when the reference is visual
instead. Forcing VLMs to rely on image representations of an entity halves
their ability to recall factual knowledge, suggesting that VLMs struggle to
link their internal knowledge of an entity with its image representation. We
show that such linking failures are correlated with the expression of distinct
patterns in model internal states, and that probes on these internal states
achieve over 92% accuracy at flagging cases where the VLM response is
unreliable. These probes can be applied, without retraining, to identify when a
VLM will fail to correctly answer a question that requires an understanding of
multimodal input. When used to facilitate selective prediction on a visual
question answering task, the probes increase coverage by 7.87% (absolute) while
also reducing the risk of error by 0.9% (absolute). Addressing the systematic,
detectable deficiency is an important avenue in language grounding, and we
provide informed recommendations for future directions.

### [4] [SERES: Semantic-aware neural reconstruction from sparse views](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18314)
*Bo Xu,Yuhu Guo,Yuchao Wang,Wenting Wang,Yeung Yam,Charlie C. L. Wang,Xinyi Le*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种语义感知的神经重建方法，从稀疏图像生成高保真3D模型，通过添加基于补丁的语义逻辑来丰富神经隐式表示，并引入基于几何基元掩码的正则化来缓解形状模糊问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决稀疏输入中特征不匹配导致的严重辐射模糊问题，提高从稀疏图像进行3D重建的质量和准确性。

Method: 在神经隐式表示中添加基于补丁的语义逻辑，与有符号距离场和辐射场联合优化，并引入基于几何基元掩码的新型正则化方法来缓解形状模糊。

Result: 在DTU数据集上，与SparseNeuS相比平均倒角距离减少44%，与VolRecon相比减少20%。作为NeuS和Neuralangelo等密集重建基线的插件，平均误差分别减少69%和68%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了稀疏图像重建中的辐射模糊和形状模糊问题，显著提高了3D重建的精度和保真度，可作为现有重建方法的有效补充。

Abstract: We propose a semantic-aware neural reconstruction method to generate 3D
high-fidelity models from sparse images. To tackle the challenge of severe
radiance ambiguity caused by mismatched features in sparse input, we enrich
neural implicit representations by adding patch-based semantic logits that are
optimized together with the signed distance field and the radiance field. A
novel regularization based on the geometric primitive masks is introduced to
mitigate shape ambiguity. The performance of our approach has been verified in
experimental evaluation. The average chamfer distances of our reconstruction on
the DTU dataset can be reduced by 44% for SparseNeuS and 20% for VolRecon. When
working as a plugin for those dense reconstruction baselines such as NeuS and
Neuralangelo, the average error on the DTU dataset can be reduced by 69% and
68% respectively.

### [5] [Automated Landfill Detection Using Deep Learning: A Comparative Study of Lightweight and Custom Architectures with the AerialWaste Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18315)
*Nowshin Sharmily,Rusab Sarmun,Muhammad E. H. Chowdhury,Mir Hamidul Hussain,Saad Bin Abul Kashem,Molla E Majid,Amith Khandakar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用轻量级深度学习模型和集成方法对AerialWaste数据集进行非法垃圾填埋场检测，达到92%以上的准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非法垃圾填埋场对全球构成严重威胁，手动识别困难且效率低，需要自动化检测方法。但高质量公开数据集稀缺，AerialWaste数据集为此提供了良好基础

Method: 采用Mobilenetv2、Googlenet、Densenet、MobileVit等轻量级深度学习模型进行训练，避免过拟合问题，并使用集成融合技术结合最佳模型

Result: 集成模型在二元分类任务上取得92.33%准确率、92.67%精确率、92.33%灵敏度、92.41% F1分数和92.71%特异性

Conclusion: 轻量级模型结合集成方法能有效识别非法垃圾填埋场，避免复杂模型过拟合问题，为环境监测提供高效解决方案

Abstract: Illegal landfills are posing as a hazardous threat to people all over the
world. Due to the arduous nature of manually identifying the location of
landfill, many landfills go unnoticed by authorities and later cause dangerous
harm to people and environment. Deep learning can play a significant role in
identifying these landfills while saving valuable time, manpower and resources.
Despite being a burning concern, good quality publicly released datasets for
illegal landfill detection are hard to find due to security concerns. However,
AerialWaste Dataset is a large collection of 10434 images of Lombardy region of
Italy. The images are of varying qualities, collected from three different
sources: AGEA Orthophotos, WorldView-3, and Google Earth. The dataset contains
professionally curated, diverse and high-quality images which makes it
particularly suitable for scalable and impactful research. As we trained
several models to compare results, we found complex and heavy models to be
prone to overfitting and memorizing training data instead of learning patterns.
Therefore, we chose lightweight simpler models which could leverage general
features from the dataset. In this study, Mobilenetv2, Googlenet, Densenet,
MobileVit and other lightweight deep learning models were used to train and
validate the dataset as they achieved significant success with less
overfitting. As we saw substantial improvement in the performance using some of
these models, we combined the best performing models and came up with an
ensemble model. With the help of ensemble and fusion technique, binary
classification could be performed on this dataset with 92.33% accuracy, 92.67%
precision, 92.33% sensitivity, 92.41% F1 score and 92.71% specificity.

### [6] [Structures Meet Semantics: Multimodal Fusion via Graph Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18322)
*Jiangfeng Sun,Sihao He,Zhonghong Ou,Meina Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了SSU框架，通过整合模态特定结构信息和跨模态语义对齐来提升多模态情感分析性能，在CMU-MOSI和MOSEI数据集上达到最先进水平


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态融合方法忽视了模态特定的结构依赖性和语义错位问题，限制了模型的质量、可解释性和鲁棒性

Method: SSU框架动态构建模态特定图（文本使用语言句法，音视频使用轻量级文本引导注意力机制），引入基于全局文本语义的语义锚点作为跨模态对齐中心，并采用多视图对比学习目标

Result: 在两个基准数据集CMU-MOSI和CMU-MOSEI上一致达到最先进性能，同时显著降低了计算开销

Conclusion: SSU框架通过语义接地交互有效捕捉细微情感模式，具有优秀的可解释性和性能表现

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) aims to infer emotional states by
effectively integrating textual, acoustic, and visual modalities. Despite
notable progress, existing multimodal fusion methods often neglect
modality-specific structural dependencies and semantic misalignment, limiting
their quality, interpretability, and robustness. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel framework called the Structural-Semantic Unifier (SSU),
which systematically integrates modality-specific structural information and
cross-modal semantic grounding for enhanced multimodal representations.
Specifically, SSU dynamically constructs modality-specific graphs by leveraging
linguistic syntax for text and a lightweight, text-guided attention mechanism
for acoustic and visual modalities, thus capturing detailed intra-modal
relationships and semantic interactions. We further introduce a semantic
anchor, derived from global textual semantics, that serves as a cross-modal
alignment hub, effectively harmonizing heterogeneous semantic spaces across
modalities. Additionally, we develop a multiview contrastive learning objective
that promotes discriminability, semantic consistency, and structural coherence
across intra- and inter-modal views. Extensive evaluations on two widely used
benchmark datasets, CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI, demonstrate that SSU consistently
achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly reducing
computational overhead compared to prior methods. Comprehensive qualitative
analyses further validate SSU's interpretability and its ability to capture
nuanced emotional patterns through semantically grounded interactions.

### [7] [FastAvatar: Instant 3D Gaussian Splatting for Faces from Single Unconstrained Poses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18389)
*Hao Liang,Zhixuan Ge,Ashish Tiwari,Soumendu Majee,G. M. Dilshan Godaliyadda,Ashok Veeraraghavan,Guha Balakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastAvatar是一个快速、姿态不变的3D高斯泼溅人脸生成框架，能够从单张任意姿态的人脸图像在10毫秒内生成高质量的3DGS模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人脸3DGS生成方法要么需要长时间优化（如FlashAvatar），要么重建质量较差（如GAGAvatar），无法满足实时交互应用的需求。

Method: 使用编码器-解码器神经网络设计，首先构建3DGS人脸模板模型，然后通过编码输入图像得到身份特征嵌入，解码预测模板高斯参数的残差，实现快速前馈推理。

Result: 在重建质量上显著优于现有前馈方法，运行速度比优化方法快1000倍，同时支持实时身份插值和属性编辑功能。

Conclusion: FastAvatar在重建质量和速度方面的优异表现，扩展了3DGS在消费级和交互式系统中逼真头像应用的范围。

Abstract: We present FastAvatar, a pose-invariant, feed-forward framework that can
generate a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model from a single face image from an
arbitrary pose in near-instant time (<10ms). FastAvatar uses a novel
encoder-decoder neural network design to achieve both fast fitting and identity
preservation regardless of input pose. First, FastAvatar constructs a 3DGS face
``template'' model from a training dataset of faces with multi-view captures.
Second, FastAvatar encodes the input face image into an identity-specific and
pose-invariant latent embedding, and decodes this embedding to predict
residuals to the structural and appearance parameters of each Gaussian in the
template 3DGS model. By only inferring residuals in a feed-forward fashion,
model inference is fast and robust. FastAvatar significantly outperforms
existing feed-forward face 3DGS methods (e.g., GAGAvatar) in reconstruction
quality, and runs 1000x faster than per-face optimization methods (e.g.,
FlashAvatar, GaussianAvatars and GASP). In addition, FastAvatar's novel latent
space design supports real-time identity interpolation and attribute editing
which is not possible with any existing feed-forward 3DGS face generation
framework. FastAvatar's combination of excellent reconstruction quality and
speed expands the scope of 3DGS for photorealistic avatar applications in
consumer and interactive systems.

*Giuseppe Stragapede,Sam Merrick,Vedrana Krivokuća Hahn,Justin Sukaitis,Vincent Graf Narbel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种适用于人道主义紧急场景的移动生物识别系统，采用PolyProtect生物特征模板保护方案，在人脸和指纹识别中验证了其有效性、安全性和隐私保护能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在紧急人道主义场景中使用生物识别技术可以提高效率，但会加剧弱势群体的数据安全风险，需要开发适合此类场景的生物特征模板保护方案。

Method: 通过系统需求分析，比较多种BTP方案，选择PolyProtect方法应用于神经网络人脸嵌入，并使用EdgeFace特征提取器在真实人道主义数据集上进行评估，同时扩展到指纹识别。

Result: 实验结果表明PolyProtect在验证和识别准确性、不可逆性和不可链接性方面表现良好，是人道主义场景中有效的生物特征保护方案。

Conclusion: PolyProtect是一种轻量级、模块化且模态无关的生物特征模板保护方法，在人道主义和紧急场景中具有实际应用价值，未来计划开源代码。

Abstract: In humanitarian and emergency scenarios, the use of biometrics can
dramatically improve the efficiency of operations, but it poses risks for the
data subjects, which are exacerbated in contexts of vulnerability. To address
this, we present a mobile biometric system implementing a biometric template
protection (BTP) scheme suitable for these scenarios. After rigorously
formulating the functional, operational, and security and privacy requirements
of these contexts, we perform a broad comparative analysis of the BTP
landscape. PolyProtect, a method designed to operate on neural network face
embeddings, is identified as the most suitable method due to its effectiveness,
modularity, and lightweight computational burden. We evaluate PolyProtect in
terms of verification and identification accuracy, irreversibility, and
unlinkability, when this BTP method is applied to face embeddings extracted
using EdgeFace, a novel state-of-the-art efficient feature extractor, on a
real-world face dataset from a humanitarian field project in Ethiopia.
Moreover, as PolyProtect promises to be modality-independent, we extend its
evaluation to fingerprints. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
time that PolyProtect has been evaluated for the identification scenario and
for fingerprint biometrics. Our experimental results are promising, and we plan
to release our code

### [9] [Why Relational Graphs Will Save the Next Generation of Vision Foundation Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18421)
*Fatemeh Ziaeetabar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文主张在视觉基础模型中引入显式关系接口（动态关系图），以解决现有模型在需要实体、角色和时空关系推理任务上的局限性，通过轻量级图推理模块提升细粒度语义保真度、鲁棒性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉基础模型在处理需要显式关系推理的任务（如细粒度人类活动识别、第一人称视频理解和多模态医学图像分析）时存在局限性，这些任务的空间、时间和语义依赖关系对性能至关重要。

Method: 提出在视觉基础模型中集成动态关系图接口，图的拓扑结构和边语义根据输入和任务上下文动态推断。通过轻量级、上下文自适应的图推理模块增强基础模型。

Result: 在人类操作动作识别和脑肿瘤分割等跨领域任务中，增强后的模型相比纯基础模型基线在细粒度语义保真度、分布外鲁棒性、可解释性和计算效率方面均有提升，同时实现了良好的内存和硬件效率。

Conclusion: 提出了FM图混合模型的针对性研究议程，重点包括学习动态图构建、多层次关系推理、跨模态融合以及直接探测结构化视觉任务中关系能力的评估协议。

Abstract: Vision foundation models (FMs) have become the predominant architecture in
computer vision, providing highly transferable representations learned from
large-scale, multimodal corpora. Nonetheless, they exhibit persistent
limitations on tasks that require explicit reasoning over entities, roles, and
spatio-temporal relations. Such relational competence is indispensable for
fine-grained human activity recognition, egocentric video understanding, and
multimodal medical image analysis, where spatial, temporal, and semantic
dependencies are decisive for performance. We advance the position that
next-generation FMs should incorporate explicit relational interfaces,
instantiated as dynamic relational graphs (graphs whose topology and edge
semantics are inferred from the input and task context). We illustrate this
position with cross-domain evidence from recent systems in human manipulation
action recognition and brain tumor segmentation, showing that augmenting FMs
with lightweight, context-adaptive graph-reasoning modules improves
fine-grained semantic fidelity, out of distribution robustness,
interpretability, and computational efficiency relative to FM only baselines.
Importantly, by reasoning sparsely over semantic nodes, such hybrids also
achieve favorable memory and hardware efficiency, enabling deployment under
practical resource constraints. We conclude with a targeted research agenda for
FM graph hybrids, prioritizing learned dynamic graph construction, multi-level
relational reasoning (e.g., part object scene in activity understanding, or
region organ in medical imaging), cross-modal fusion, and evaluation protocols
that directly probe relational competence in structured vision tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种直接生成大规模3D驾驶场景的方法，结合代理几何生成和从2D图像先验中识别分散的方法，实现了高可控性、准确几何和因果性的场景生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经重建方法受限于静态环境和抓取数据，而图像/视频生成模型缺乏几何基础和因果性。需要找到一种方法来突破这些限制，生成具有准确几何和因果关系的大规模3D驾驶场景。

Method: 结合代理几何生成和环境表示，以及从学习到的2D图像先验中进行分散识别。允许通过提示指导来控制生成的几何、结构和纹理。

Result: 方法能够生成高保真度、几何一致的复杂驾驶场景，支持因果新视角合成和显式3D几何估计，并可以基于地图布局进行条件化生成。

Conclusion: 该方法成功突破了现有技术的限制，实现了高可控性的同时保持几何准确性和因果性，为机器人学习提供了质量更高的大规模3D驾驶场景数据。

Abstract: Large-scale scene data is essential for training and testing in robot
learning. Neural reconstruction methods have promised the capability of
reconstructing large physically-grounded outdoor scenes from captured sensor
data. However, these methods have baked-in static environments and only allow
for limited scene control -- they are functionally constrained in scene and
trajectory diversity by the captures from which they are reconstructed. In
contrast, generating driving data with recent image or video diffusion models
offers control, however, at the cost of geometry grounding and causality. In
this work, we aim to bridge this gap and present a method that directly
generates large-scale 3D driving scenes with accurate geometry, allowing for
causal novel view synthesis with object permanence and explicit 3D geometry
estimation. The proposed method combines the generation of a proxy geometry and
environment representation with score distillation from learned 2D image
priors. We find that this approach allows for high controllability, enabling
the prompt-guided geometry and high-fidelity texture and structure that can be
conditioned on map layouts -- producing realistic and geometrically consistent
3D generations of complex driving scenes.

*Lucas Wojcik,Gabriel E. Lima,Valfride Nascimento,Eduil Nascimento Jr.,Rayson Laroca,David Menotti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个新的车牌可读性分类数据集(LPLC)，包含10,210张图片和12,687个注释车牌，用于解决自动车牌识别中难读车牌的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动车牌识别系统在处理难读车牌时效果差，而超分辨率等重建方法并未彻底解决问题。需要一种能够选择性地应用图像前处理的方法，以优化模型性能和计算效率。

Method: 构建了一个细粒度注释的数据集，包含车辆和车牌层面的遮挡信息、四个可读性类别(完美、良好、较差、无法识别)以及字符标签。作为基准，使用三种图像识别网络(ViT、ResNet、YOLO)进行车牌可读性分类任务。

Result: 三个基准模型的总体F1分数均低于80%，说明该任务具有很高难度。对超分辨率和车牌识别方法的分析进一步强调了该领域需要更多研究。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个公开的车牌可读性分类数据集，并证明了识别难读车牌的挑战性。数据集的细粒度注释和广泛的场景覆盖为进一步研究提供了基础，并强调了发展更有效图像前处理策略的必要性。

Abstract: Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) faces a major challenge when
dealing with illegible license plates (LPs). While reconstruction methods such
as super-resolution (SR) have emerged, the core issue of recognizing these
low-quality LPs remains unresolved. To optimize model performance and
computational efficiency, image pre-processing should be applied selectively to
cases that require enhanced legibility. To support research in this area, we
introduce a novel dataset comprising 10,210 images of vehicles with 12,687
annotated LPs for legibility classification (the LPLC dataset). The images span
a wide range of vehicle types, lighting conditions, and camera/image quality
levels. We adopt a fine-grained annotation strategy that includes vehicle- and
LP-level occlusions, four legibility categories (perfect, good, poor, and
illegible), and character labels for three categories (excluding illegible
LPs). As a benchmark, we propose a classification task using three image
recognition networks to determine whether an LP image is good enough, requires
super-resolution, or is completely unrecoverable. The overall F1 score, which
remained below 80% for all three baseline models (ViT, ResNet, and YOLO),
together with the analyses of SR and LP recognition methods, highlights the
difficulty of the task and reinforces the need for further research. The
proposed dataset is publicly available at
https://github.com/lmlwojcik/lplc-dataset.

*Aranya Saha,Tanvir Ahmed Khan,Ismam Nur Swapnil,Mohammad Ariful Haque*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLARIFY是一个专门用于皮肤病视觉问答的专家-通用框架，通过轻量级专家分类器和压缩的通用视觉语言模型结合，在提高诊断准确性的同时显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决通用视觉语言模型在医疗领域诊断准确性不足和推理成本高的问题，需要开发专门针对皮肤病诊断的高效可靠AI系统。

Method: 采用专家-通用框架：轻量级专家图像分类器提供快速准确诊断预测，压缩的通用对话VLM生成自然语言解释，并通过知识图谱检索模块确保回答的事实准确性。

Result: 在皮肤病数据集上，CLARIFY比最强基线模型诊断准确率提升18%，同时VRAM需求降低20%以上，延迟减少5%以上。

Conclusion: 专家-通用系统为构建轻量级、可信赖且临床可行的AI系统提供了实用而强大的范式。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown significant potential for medical
tasks; however, their general-purpose nature can limit specialized diagnostic
accuracy, and their large size poses substantial inference costs for real-world
clinical deployment. To address these challenges, we introduce CLARIFY, a
Specialist-Generalist framework for dermatological visual question answering
(VQA). CLARIFY combines two components: (i) a lightweight, domain-trained image
classifier (the Specialist) that provides fast and highly accurate diagnostic
predictions, and (ii) a powerful yet compressed conversational VLM (the
Generalist) that generates natural language explanations to user queries. In
our framework, the Specialist's predictions directly guide the Generalist's
reasoning, focusing it on the correct diagnostic path. This synergy is further
enhanced by a knowledge graph-based retrieval module, which grounds the
Generalist's responses in factual dermatological knowledge, ensuring both
accuracy and reliability. This hierarchical design not only reduces diagnostic
errors but also significantly improves computational efficiency. Experiments on
our curated multimodal dermatology dataset demonstrate that CLARIFY achieves an
18\% improvement in diagnostic accuracy over the strongest baseline, a
fine-tuned, uncompressed single-line VLM, while reducing the average VRAM
requirement and latency by at least 20\% and 5\%, respectively. These results
indicate that a Specialist-Generalist system provides a practical and powerful
paradigm for building lightweight, trustworthy, and clinically viable AI

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的上下文感知零样本异常检测框架，结合TimeSformer、DPC和CLIP模型来检测监控视频中的异常事件，无需在训练时接触异常样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监控视频中的异常检测具有挑战性，因为异常事件不可预测且高度依赖上下文。传统方法需要大量异常样本进行训练，而零样本方法可以检测未见过的异常行为。

Method: 采用混合架构：TimeSformer作为视觉骨干提取时空特征，DPC预测未来表示以识别时间偏差，CLIP基于语义流通过上下文特定文本提示实现概念级异常检测。使用InfoNCE和CPC损失联合训练，并引入上下文门控机制增强决策。

Result: 该框架能够整合预测建模和视觉语言理解，在复杂环境中泛化到先前未见的行为，弥合了零样本异常检测中时间推理和语义上下文之间的差距。

Conclusion: 提出的上下文感知零样本异常检测框架通过结合时空建模和语义理解，为监控视频中的异常检测提供了一种有效的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in surveillance footage is inherently challenging due to
their unpredictable and context-dependent nature. This work introduces a novel
context-aware zero-shot anomaly detection framework that identifies abnormal
events without exposure to anomaly examples during training. The proposed
hybrid architecture combines TimeSformer, DPC, and CLIP to model spatiotemporal
dynamics and semantic context. TimeSformer serves as the vision backbone to
extract rich spatial-temporal features, while DPC forecasts future
representations to identify temporal deviations. Furthermore, a CLIP-based
semantic stream enables concept-level anomaly detection through
context-specific text prompts. These components are jointly trained using
InfoNCE and CPC losses, aligning visual inputs with their temporal and semantic
representations. A context-gating mechanism further enhances decision-making by
modulating predictions with scene-aware cues or global video features. By
integrating predictive modeling with vision-language understanding, the system
can generalize to previously unseen behaviors in complex environments. This
framework bridges the gap between temporal reasoning and semantic context in
zero-shot anomaly detection for surveillance. The code for this research has
been made available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DoGFlow是一种自监督的3D场景流估计框架，利用4D雷达多普勒测量生成运动伪标签，无需人工标注即可实现与全监督方法相媲美的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自监督方法在长距离和恶劣天气场景下性能不足，而全监督方法依赖昂贵的人工标注难以扩展。需要开发无需人工标注但性能接近全监督方法的解决方案。

Method: 提出跨模态标签迁移方法，从4D雷达多普勒测量实时计算运动伪标签，通过动态感知关联和歧义消除传播将标签迁移到LiDAR域。

Result: 在MAN TruckScenes数据集上显著超越现有自监督方法，仅需10%的标注数据即可达到全监督方法90%以上的性能。

Conclusion: DoGFlow证明了利用雷达多普勒信息进行自监督学习的有效性，为3D场景流估计提供了可扩展且高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate 3D scene flow estimation is critical for autonomous systems to
navigate dynamic environments safely, but creating the necessary large-scale,
manually annotated datasets remains a significant bottleneck for developing
robust perception models. Current self-supervised methods struggle to match the
performance of fully supervised approaches, especially in challenging
long-range and adverse weather scenarios, while supervised methods are not
scalable due to their reliance on expensive human labeling. We introduce
DoGFlow, a novel self-supervised framework that recovers full 3D object motions
for LiDAR scene flow estimation without requiring any manual ground truth
annotations. This paper presents our cross-modal label transfer approach, where
DoGFlow computes motion pseudo-labels in real-time directly from 4D radar
Doppler measurements and transfers them to the LiDAR domain using dynamic-aware
association and ambiguity-resolved propagation. On the challenging MAN
TruckScenes dataset, DoGFlow substantially outperforms existing self-supervised
methods and improves label efficiency by enabling LiDAR backbones to achieve
over 90% of fully supervised performance with only 10% of the ground truth
data. For more details, please visit https://ajinkyakhoche.github.io/DogFlow/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图像的3D生成方法难以从卫星图像的俯视图恢复准确建筑结构，而3D细节化方法依赖高度详细的体素输入，无法从简单先验（如立方体）产生满意结果。

Method: 建模从插值噪声粗糙先验到详细几何的转换，开发了包含5万多个独特风格化3D建筑资产的大规模数据集Skylines-50K。

Result: 广泛评估表明该方法有效且具有强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SatSkylines解决了现有方法的局限性，能够在不增加计算成本的情况下实现灵活的几何控制，为详细建筑模型生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present SatSkylines, a 3D building generation approach that takes
satellite imagery and coarse geometric priors. Without proper geometric
guidance, existing image-based 3D generation methods struggle to recover
accurate building structures from the top-down views of satellite images alone.
On the other hand, 3D detailization methods tend to rely heavily on highly
detailed voxel inputs and fail to produce satisfying results from simple priors
such as cuboids. To address these issues, our key idea is to model the
transformation from interpolated noisy coarse priors to detailed geometries,
enabling flexible geometric control without additional computational cost. We
have further developed Skylines-50K, a large-scale dataset of over 50,000
unique and stylized 3D building assets in order to support the generations of
detailed building models. Extensive evaluations indicate the effectiveness of
our model and strong generalization ability.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种深度学习流水线来检测游戏中的空间过渡点（STP）和主要过渡点（MSTP），为AI导航和数据驱动的关卡设计提供基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在复杂的3D游戏环境中，高效识别地图过渡点对客户端自动地图制作和关卡呈现评估至关重要。需要形成化这个任务并为它设置基准性能指标。

Method: 采用两阶段深度学习流水线：第一阶段使用Faster R-CNN检测潜在STP，第二阶段通过结合局部和全局视觉特征的轻量级MSTP选择器进行排名。使用参数高效的adapter技术，还包含可选的检索增强融合步骤。

Result: 在五款动作RPG游戏的自建数据集上验证。完整网络微调在数据充足时STP检测效果更好，而adapter传输在低数据场景和MSTP选择任务中更稳健和有效。

Conclusion: 通过定义这个新题、提供基准流程和数据集，以及有效模型适配的初步见解，为未来的AI驱动导航辅助和数据驱动的关卡设计工具做出贡献。

Abstract: In complex 3D game environments, players rely on visual affordances to spot
map transition points. Efficient identification of such points is important to
client-side auto-mapping, and provides an objective basis for evaluating map
cue presentation. In this work, we formalize the task of detecting traversable
Spatial Transition Points (STPs)-connectors between two sub regions-and
selecting the singular Main STP (MSTP), the unique STP that lies on the
designer-intended critical path toward the player's current macro-objective,
from a single game frame, proposing this as a new research focus. We introduce
a two-stage deep-learning pipeline that first detects potential STPs using
Faster R-CNN and then ranks them with a lightweight MSTP selector that fuses
local and global visual features. Both stages benefit from parameter-efficient
adapters, and we further introduce an optional retrieval-augmented fusion step.
Our primary goal is to establish the feasibility of this problem and set
baseline performance metrics. We validate our approach on a custom-built,
diverse dataset collected from five Action RPG titles. Our experiments reveal a
key trade-off: while full-network fine-tuning produces superior STP detection
with sufficient data, adapter-only transfer is significantly more robust and
effective in low-data scenarios and for the MSTP selection task. By defining
this novel problem, providing a baseline pipeline and dataset, and offering
initial insights into efficient model adaptation, we aim to contribute to
future AI-driven navigation aids and data-informed level-design tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的音频驱动角色动画方法主要适用于语音和歌唱场景，但在需要复杂角色互动、细腻身体动作和动态镜头工作的影视制作中表现不足，无法满足电影级动画制作的需求。

Method: 提出了基于Wan的音频驱动模型Wan-S2V，通过改进模型架构和训练策略，增强了在电影场景中的表现力和保真度。

Result: 在广泛的实验中，与Hunyuan-Avatar和Omnihuman等前沿模型相比，Wan-S2V始终显著优于现有解决方案，并在长视频生成和精确视频唇形同步编辑等应用中展现出良好的通用性。

Conclusion: Wan-S2V成功解决了实现电影级角色动画的长期挑战，为复杂影视制作提供了更高质量的音频驱动动画解决方案。

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for audio-driven character animation
demonstrate promising performance for scenarios primarily involving speech and
singing. However, they often fall short in more complex film and television
productions, which demand sophisticated elements such as nuanced character
interactions, realistic body movements, and dynamic camera work. To address
this long-standing challenge of achieving film-level character animation, we
propose an audio-driven model, which we refere to as Wan-S2V, built upon Wan.
Our model achieves significantly enhanced expressiveness and fidelity in
cinematic contexts compared to existing approaches. We conducted extensive
experiments, benchmarking our method against cutting-edge models such as
Hunyuan-Avatar and Omnihuman. The experimental results consistently demonstrate
that our approach significantly outperforms these existing solutions.
Additionally, we explore the versatility of our method through its applications
in long-form video generation and precise video lip-sync editing.

TL;DR: 提出DeReF框架，通过随机特征重组策略解决多模态癌症生存分析中固定融合方案和MoE融合信息交互受限的问题，在多个数据集上验证有效性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态癌症生存分析方法面临两个关键挑战：固定融合方案导致模型过度依赖预定义特征组合，限制动态融合能力；MoE融合方法中各专家网络处理分离的解耦特征，限制了特征间的信息交互

Method: 提出DeReF（Decoupling-Reorganization-Fusion）框架，包含模态解耦模块、随机特征重组策略和动态MoE融合模块。在解耦模块中引入区域交叉注意力网络提升特征表示质量

Result: 在内部肝癌数据集和三个TCGA公共数据集上的广泛实验证实了所提方法的有效性

Conclusion: DeReF框架通过特征重组策略增强了特征组合多样性，克服了信息封闭问题，提高了专家网络对解耦特征间信息的捕获能力，显著提升了多模态癌症生存分析的性能

Abstract: Cancer survival analysis commonly integrates information across diverse
medical modalities to make survival-time predictions. Existing methods
primarily focus on extracting different decoupled features of modalities and
performing fusion operations such as concatenation, attention, and MoE-based
(Mixture-of-Experts) fusion. However, these methods still face two key
challenges: i) Fixed fusion schemes (concatenation and attention) can lead to
model over-reliance on predefined feature combinations, limiting the dynamic
fusion of decoupled features; ii) in MoE-based fusion methods, each expert
network handles separate decoupled features, which limits information
interaction among the decoupled features. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel Decoupling-Reorganization-Fusion framework (DeReF), which
devises a random feature reorganization strategy between modalities decoupling
and dynamic MoE fusion modules.Its advantages are: i) it increases the
diversity of feature combinations and granularity, enhancing the generalization
ability of the subsequent expert networks; ii) it overcomes the problem of
information closure and helps expert networks better capture information among
decoupled features. Additionally, we incorporate a regional cross-attention
network within the modality decoupling module to improve the representation
quality of decoupled features. Extensive experimental results on our in-house
Liver Cancer (LC) and three widely used TCGA public datasets confirm the
effectiveness of our proposed method. The code will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频对象移除方法在处理对象副作用（阴影、反射、光照、半透明和镜像效应）时表现不佳，主要缺乏配对的监督数据

Method: 使用3D渲染引擎生成合成数据，构建大规模配对数据集；基于扩散变换器的视频修复模型；通过参考式擦除定位所有相关区域；引入额外监督预测受影响区域

Result: ROSE在各类副作用移除任务上表现优异，优于现有视频对象擦除模型，并能很好地泛化到真实世界视频场景

Conclusion: 提出的ROSE框架通过系统性处理对象副作用和合成数据生成，显著提升了视频对象移除的质量和完整性，为视频编辑提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Video object removal has achieved advanced performance due to the recent
success of video generative models. However, when addressing the side effects
of objects, e.g., their shadows and reflections, existing works struggle to
eliminate these effects for the scarcity of paired video data as supervision.
This paper presents ROSE, termed Remove Objects with Side Effects, a framework
that systematically studies the object's effects on environment, which can be
categorized into five common cases: shadows, reflections, light, translucency
and mirror. Given the challenges of curating paired videos exhibiting the
aforementioned effects, we leverage a 3D rendering engine for synthetic data
generation. We carefully construct a fully-automatic pipeline for data
preparation, which simulates a large-scale paired dataset with diverse scenes,
objects, shooting angles, and camera trajectories. ROSE is implemented as an
video inpainting model built on diffusion transformer. To localize all
object-correlated areas, the entire video is fed into the model for
reference-based erasing. Moreover, additional supervision is introduced to
explicitly predict the areas affected by side effects, which can be revealed
through the differential mask between the paired videos. To fully investigate
the model performance on various side effect removal, we presents a new
benchmark, dubbed ROSE-Bench, incorporating both common scenarios and the five
special side effects for comprehensive evaluation. Experimental results
demonstrate that ROSE achieves superior performance compared to existing video
object erasing models and generalizes well to real-world video scenarios. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频字幕生成方法存在运动-细节不平衡问题，模型往往过度强调一个方面而忽视另一个方面，导致生成的字幕不完整，影响视频理解和生成的一致性。

Method: 1) 数据层面：通过两阶段流程（运动-细节融合和细粒度检查）构建HMD-270K数据集；2) 优化层面：基于组相对策略优化提出字幕集等价奖励机制，通过单元到集合匹配和双向验证增强完整性和准确性。

Result: OwlCap模型在细节导向的VDC基准上准确率提升4.2%，在运动导向的DREAM-1K基准上F1分数提升4.6%。

Conclusion: 提出的HMD-270K数据集和OwlCap模型有效解决了视频字幕生成中的运动-细节不平衡问题，为视频字幕研究社区提供了有价值的资源。

Abstract: Video captioning aims to generate comprehensive and coherent descriptions of
the video content, contributing to the advancement of both video understanding
and generation. However, existing methods often suffer from motion-detail
imbalance, as models tend to overemphasize one aspect while neglecting the
other. This imbalance results in incomplete captions, which in turn leads to a
lack of consistency in video understanding and generation. To address this
issue, we propose solutions from two aspects: 1) Data aspect: We constructed
the Harmonizing Motion-Detail 270K (HMD-270K) dataset through a two-stage
pipeline: Motion-Detail Fusion (MDF) and Fine-Grained Examination (FGE). 2)
Optimization aspect: We introduce the Caption Set Equivalence Reward (CSER)
based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). CSER enhances completeness
and accuracy in capturing both motion and details through unit-to-set matching
and bidirectional validation. Based on the HMD-270K supervised fine-tuning and
GRPO post-training with CSER, we developed OwlCap, a powerful video captioning
multi-modal large language model (MLLM) with motion-detail balance.
Experimental results demonstrate that OwlCap achieves significant improvements
compared to baseline models on two benchmarks: the detail-focused VDC (+4.2
Acc) and the motion-focused DREAM-1K (+4.6 F1). The HMD-270K dataset and OwlCap
model will be publicly released to facilitate video captioning research
community advancements.

Result: 在三个主流检测框架（Faster R-CNN、DETR、Sparse R-CNN）上的实验表明，所有框架都取得了显著的性能提升

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了甲骨文拓片图像检测中的退化问题，为数字考古提供了有效的自动化检测解决方案

Abstract: Oracle Bone Inscriptions (OBIs), play a crucial role in understanding ancient
Chinese civilization. The automated detection of OBIs from rubbing images
represents a fundamental yet challenging task in digital archaeology, primarily
due to various degradation factors including noise and cracks that limit the
effectiveness of conventional detection networks. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel clustering-based feature space representation learning
method. Our approach uniquely leverages the Oracle Bones Character (OBC) font
library dataset as prior knowledge to enhance feature extraction in the
detection network through clustering-based representation learning. The method
incorporates a specialized loss function derived from clustering results to
optimize feature representation, which is then integrated into the total
network loss. We validate the effectiveness of our method by conducting
experiments on two OBIs detection dataset using three mainstream detection
frameworks: Faster R-CNN, DETR, and Sparse R-CNN. Through extensive
experimentation, all frameworks demonstrate significant performance
improvements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于SNR先验的水下图像增强方法在空间域存在两个局限：无法有效分离跨通道干扰，以及在放大信息结构同时抑制噪声方面帮助有限

Method: 提出频域SNR先验方法，将特征分解为幅度和相位谱；设计傅里叶注意力SNR先验变换器(FAST)结合频谱交互和SNR线索；使用频率自适应变换器(FAT)瓶颈融合高低频分支；采用统一U型架构整合常规RGB流和SNR引导分支

Result: 在UIEB、EUVP和LSUI数据集的4800对图像上训练，PSNR提升3.1dB，SSIM提升0.08，成功恢复水下场景的颜色、纹理和对比度

Conclusion: 频域SNR先验方法有效克服了空间域方法的局限性，SFormer在性能上超越了近期的最优方法

Abstract: Recent learning-based underwater image enhancement (UIE) methods have
advanced by incorporating physical priors into deep neural networks,
particularly using the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) prior to reduce
wavelength-dependent attenuation. However, spatial domain SNR priors have two
limitations: (i) they cannot effectively separate cross-channel interference,
and (ii) they provide limited help in amplifying informative structures while
suppressing noise. To overcome these, we propose using the SNR prior in the
frequency domain, decomposing features into amplitude and phase spectra for
better channel modulation. We introduce the Fourier Attention SNR-prior
Transformer (FAST), combining spectral interactions with SNR cues to highlight
key spectral components. Additionally, the Frequency Adaptive Transformer (FAT)
bottleneck merges low- and high-frequency branches using a gated attention
mechanism to enhance perceptual quality. Embedded in a unified U-shaped
architecture, these modules integrate a conventional RGB stream with an
SNR-guided branch, forming SFormer. Trained on 4,800 paired images from UIEB,
EUVP, and LSUI, SFormer surpasses recent methods with a 3.1 dB gain in PSNR and
0.08 in SSIM, successfully restoring colors, textures, and contrast in
underwater scenes.

Motivation: 现有研究虽然分割性能良好，但在射血分数估计方面表现不佳，需要同时处理单帧细节和多帧时空关系来提升EF估计准确性。

Method: 采用分层设计：低层使用卷积网络处理单帧图像保留细节，高层使用Mamba架构捕捉时空关系；提出时空交叉扫描(STCS)模块通过跨帧跨位置扫描整合长距离上下文信息。

Result: 该方法能够平衡单帧和多帧处理，避免单帧处理的局部误差累积和多帧处理的细节忽略问题，减少超声图像噪声等因素导致的EF计算偏差。

Conclusion: 分层时空分割网络通过协同局部细节建模和全局动态感知，有效提升了超声心动图视频中左心室心内膜分割和射血分数估计的准确性。

Abstract: Automated segmentation of the left ventricular endocardium in
echocardiography videos is a key research area in cardiology. It aims to
provide accurate assessment of cardiac structure and function through Ejection
Fraction (EF) estimation. Although existing studies have achieved good
segmentation performance, their results do not perform well in EF estimation.
In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Spatio-temporal Segmentation Network
(\ourmodel) for echocardiography video, aiming to improve EF estimation
accuracy by synergizing local detail modeling with global dynamic perception.
The network employs a hierarchical design, with low-level stages using
convolutional networks to process single-frame images and preserve details,
while high-level stages utilize the Mamba architecture to capture
spatio-temporal relationships. The hierarchical design balances single-frame
and multi-frame processing, avoiding issues such as local error accumulation
when relying solely on single frames or neglecting details when using only
multi-frame data. To overcome local spatio-temporal limitations, we propose the
Spatio-temporal Cross Scan (STCS) module, which integrates long-range context
through skip scanning across frames and positions. This approach helps mitigate
EF calculation biases caused by ultrasound image noise and other factors.

Conclusion: FPS为迁移学习特别是域适应任务提供了一个简单、有效且通用的范式，显著降低了内存和计算成本，同时保持了良好的可解释性。

Abstract: Domain shift, characterized by degraded model performance during transition
from labeled source domains to unlabeled target domains, poses a persistent
challenge for deploying deep learning systems. Current unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) methods predominantly rely on fine-tuning feature extractors -
an approach limited by inefficiency, reduced interpretability, and poor
scalability to modern architectures.
  Our analysis reveals that models pretrained on large-scale data exhibit
domain-invariant geometric patterns in their feature space, characterized by
intra-class clustering and inter-class separation, thereby preserving
transferable discriminative structures. These findings indicate that domain
shifts primarily manifest as boundary misalignment rather than feature
degradation.
  Unlike fine-tuning entire pre-trained models - which risks introducing
unpredictable feature distortions - we propose the Feature-space Planes
Searcher (FPS): a novel domain adaptation framework that optimizes decision
boundaries by leveraging these geometric patterns while keeping the feature
encoder frozen. This streamlined approach enables interpretative analysis of
adaptation while substantially reducing memory and computational costs through
offline feature extraction, permitting full-dataset optimization in a single
computation cycle.
  Evaluations on public benchmarks demonstrate that FPS achieves competitive or
superior performance to state-of-the-art methods. FPS scales efficiently with
multimodal large models and shows versatility across diverse domains including
protein structure prediction, remote sensing classification, and earthquake
detection. We anticipate FPS will provide a simple, effective, and
generalizable paradigm for transfer learning, particularly in domain adaptation
tasks. .

Motivation: 解决人类行为识别系统在计算成本、特征冗余和实时扩展性方面的挑战，适用于智能监控、医疗健康、辅助技术等应用场景。

Method: 集成自定制InceptionV3提取空间特征，LSTM模型化时序依赖关系，使用基因算法组合ADFSA策略进行特征选择，动态平衡准确性、冗余度、唯一性和复杂度目标。

Conclusion: 该框架通过深度学习与特征竞优的结合，实现了高效、轻量化的人类行为识别，为智能监控、公共安全等领域提供了可行的实时解决方案。

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a pivotal role in various
applications, including smart surveillance, healthcare, assistive technologies,
sports analytics, etc. However, HAR systems still face critical challenges,
including high computational costs, redundant features, and limited scalability
in real-time scenarios. An optimized hybrid deep learning framework is
introduced that integrates a customized InceptionV3, an LSTM architecture, and
a novel ensemble-based feature selection strategy. The proposed framework first
extracts spatial descriptors using the customized InceptionV3 model, which
captures multilevel contextual patterns, region homogeneity, and fine-grained
localization cues. The temporal dependencies across frames are then modeled
using LSTMs to effectively encode motion dynamics. Finally, an ensemble-based
genetic algorithm with Adaptive Dynamic Fitness Sharing and Attention (ADFSA)
is employed to select a compact and optimized feature set by dynamically
balancing objectives such as accuracy, redundancy, uniqueness, and complexity
reduction. Consequently, the selected feature subsets, which are both diverse
and discriminative, enable various lightweight machine learning classifiers to
achieve accurate and robust HAR in heterogeneous environments. Experimental
results on the robust UCF-YouTube dataset, which presents challenges such as
occlusion, cluttered backgrounds, motion dynamics, and poor illumination,
demonstrate good performance. The proposed approach achieves 99.65% recognition
accuracy, reduces features to as few as 7, and enhances inference time. The
lightweight and scalable nature of the HAR system supports real-time deployment
on edge devices such as Raspberry Pi, enabling practical applications in
intelligent, resource-aware environments, including public safety, assistive
technology, and autonomous monitoring systems.

TL;DR: ColorGS是一个用于内窥镜视频中可变形组织重建的新框架，通过空间自适应颜色编码和增强变形建模，在保持实时渲染效率的同时实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在捕捉细微颜色变化和建模全局变形方面存在局限，3D高斯泼溅的固定颜色分配和线性变形建模无法处理复杂纹理和一致的全局变形。

Method: 提出Colored Gaussian Primitives使用动态锚点和可学习颜色参数自适应编码空间变化纹理；设计Enhanced Deformation Model结合时间感知高斯基函数和可学习时间无关变形，精确捕捉局部组织变形和全局运动一致性。

Conclusion: ColorGS通过平衡高保真度和计算实用性，推进了手术场景重建技术，对术中指导和AR/VR应用至关重要。

Abstract: High-fidelity reconstruction of deformable tissues from endoscopic videos
remains challenging due to the limitations of existing methods in capturing
subtle color variations and modeling global deformations. While 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) enables efficient dynamic reconstruction, its fixed
per-Gaussian color assignment struggles with intricate textures, and linear
deformation modeling fails to model consistent global deformation. To address
these issues, we propose ColorGS, a novel framework that integrates spatially
adaptive color encoding and enhanced deformation modeling for surgical scene
reconstruction. First, we introduce Colored Gaussian Primitives, which employ
dynamic anchors with learnable color parameters to adaptively encode spatially
varying textures, significantly improving color expressiveness under complex
lighting and tissue similarity. Second, we design an Enhanced Deformation Model
(EDM) that combines time-aware Gaussian basis functions with learnable
time-independent deformations, enabling precise capture of both localized
tissue deformations and global motion consistency caused by surgical
interactions. Extensive experiments on DaVinci robotic surgery videos and
benchmark datasets (EndoNeRF, StereoMIS) demonstrate that ColorGS achieves
state-of-the-art performance, attaining a PSNR of 39.85 (1.5 higher than prior
3DGS-based methods) and superior SSIM (97.25\%) while maintaining real-time
rendering efficiency. Our work advances surgical scene reconstruction by
balancing high fidelity with computational practicality, critical for
intraoperative guidance and AR/VR applications.

Motivation: 解决神经网络在不平衡数据集上训练时偏向多数类而导致少数类识别性能下降的问题

Method: 提出类别泛满正则化，根据类别频率设置不同的泛满阈值，压制多数类过拟合同时充分学习少数类

Result: 在不平衡图像分类任务中，方法提升了少数类的分类性能，并获得更好的总体泛化性能

Conclusion: 类别泛满正则化能有效解决不平衡数据集上的类别偏向问题，为少数类识别提供了有效的正则化手段

Abstract: The purpose of training neural networks is to achieve high generalization
performance on unseen inputs. However, when trained on imbalanced datasets, a
model's prediction tends to favor majority classes over minority classes,
leading to significant degradation in the recognition performance of minority
classes. To address this issue, we propose class-wise flooding regularization,
an extension of flooding regularization applied at the class level. Flooding is
a regularization technique that mitigates overfitting by preventing the
training loss from falling below a predefined threshold, known as the flooding
level, thereby discouraging memorization. Our proposed method assigns a
class-specific flooding level based on class frequencies. By doing so, it
suppresses overfitting in majority classes while allowing sufficient learning
for minority classes. We validate our approach on imbalanced image
classification. Compared to conventional flooding regularizations, our method
improves the classification performance of minority classes and achieves better
overall generalization.

*Hiroaki Aizawa,Yoshikazu Hayashi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ADM难度度量方法，结合课程学习和SAM优化，解决平坦区域中样本难度评估难题，提升模型泛化性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统课程学习依赖损失值或梯度范数评估样本难度，但在平坦最小值区域这些指标变得无效，无法有效结合课程学习和SAM优化

Method: 提出对抗难度度量(ADM)，通过计算原始样本与对抗样本的归一化损失差距来量化样本难度，在平坦区域仍保持有效性，并将其集成到基于SAM的课程学习框架中

Result: 在图像分类、细粒度识别和域泛化任务上验证，方法同时保留了课程学习和SAM的优势，优于现有课程学习和平坦感知训练策略

Conclusion: ADM提供了一种在平坦优化区域中有效评估样本难度的方法，成功实现了课程学习与SAM优化的有效结合，显著提升了模型泛化能力

Abstract: Neural networks trained by empirical risk minimization often suffer from
overfitting, especially to specific samples or domains, which leads to poor
generalization. Curriculum Learning (CL) addresses this issue by selecting
training samples based on the difficulty. From the optimization perspective,
methods such as Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) improve robustness and
generalization by seeking flat minima. However, combining CL with SAM is not
straightforward. In flat regions, both the loss values and the gradient norms
tend to become uniformly small, which makes it difficult to evaluate sample
difficulty and design an effective curriculum. To overcome this problem, we
propose the Adversarial Difficulty Measure (ADM), which quantifies adversarial
vulnerability by leveraging the robustness properties of models trained toward
flat minima. Unlike loss- or gradient-based measures, which become ineffective
as training progresses into flatter regions, ADM remains informative by
measuring the normalized loss gap between original and adversarial examples. We
incorporate ADM into CL-based training with SAM to dynamically assess sample
difficulty. We evaluated our approach on image classification tasks,
fine-grained recognition, and domain generalization. The results demonstrate
that our method preserves the strengths of both CL and SAM while outperforming
existing curriculum-based and flatness-aware training strategies.

TL;DR: 本文分析了水下目标检测中扇贝类检测性能不佳的原因，发现定位阶段的前景-背景区分是主要问题，分类阶段存在固有特征挑战，建议根据精度或召回率优先选择不同的数据分布策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下目标检测对海洋生态监测至关重要，但存在图像质量退化、类别分布不平衡和独特视觉特征等挑战。不同物种检测性能差异显著，但根本原因尚不清楚。

Method: 使用DUO数据集，将目标检测任务分解为定位和分类两个阶段，利用YOLO11和TIDE工具分析扇贝类的检测性能问题，进行定位分析和分类实验。

Result: 定位分析发现前景-背景区分是最具挑战性的阶段；分类实验显示即使数据平衡，精度差距仍然存在，表明存在超越数据稀缺和类间依赖的固有特征挑战。

Conclusion: 建议在优先精度时使用不平衡分布，优先召回率时使用平衡分布。改进低性能类别应重点关注算法进步，特别是在定位模块方面。代码和数据集已公开。

Abstract: Underwater object detection is critical for monitoring marine ecosystems but
poses unique challenges, including degraded image quality, imbalanced class
distribution, and distinct visual characteristics. Not every species is
detected equally well, yet underlying causes remain unclear. We address two key
research questions: 1) What factors beyond data quantity drive class-specific
performance disparities? 2) How can we systematically improve detection of
under-performing marine species? We manipulate the DUO dataset to separate the
object detection task into localization and classification and investigate the
under-performance of the scallop class. Localization analysis using YOLO11 and
TIDE finds that foreground-background discrimination is the most problematic
stage regardless of data quantity. Classification experiments reveal persistent
precision gaps even with balanced data, indicating intrinsic feature-based
challenges beyond data scarcity and inter-class dependencies. We recommend
imbalanced distributions when prioritizing precision, and balanced
distributions when prioritizing recall. Improving under-performing classes
should focus on algorithmic advances, especially within localization modules.
We publicly release our code and datasets.

Result: 通过全面实验证明了方法的有效性，能够保持几何精度和设计意图，实现从2D工程图到参数化CAD模型的准确转换。

Conclusion: 该工作填补了从2D工程图自动生成参数化CAD模型的研究空白，为工业设计流程提供了更符合实际工作方式的解决方案。

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) generative modeling is driving significant
innovations across industrial applications. Recent works have shown remarkable
progress in creating solid models from various inputs such as point clouds,
meshes, and text descriptions. However, these methods fundamentally diverge
from traditional industrial workflows that begin with 2D engineering drawings.
The automatic generation of parametric CAD models from these 2D vector drawings
remains underexplored despite being a critical step in engineering design. To
address this gap, our key insight is to reframe CAD generation as a
sequence-to-sequence learning problem where vector drawing primitives directly
inform the generation of parametric CAD operations, preserving geometric
precision and design intent throughout the transformation process. We propose
Drawing2CAD, a framework with three key technical components: a
network-friendly vector primitive representation that preserves precise
geometric information, a dual-decoder transformer architecture that decouples
command type and parameter generation while maintaining precise correspondence,
and a soft target distribution loss function accommodating inherent flexibility
in CAD parameters. To train and evaluate Drawing2CAD, we create CAD-VGDrawing,
a dataset of paired engineering drawings and parametric CAD models, and conduct
thorough experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Code and
dataset are available at https://github.com/lllssc/Drawing2CAD.

Method: 提出路由器间控的跨模态特征融合框架，基于标记级声学性评分动态重新调整音频和视觉特征权重，通过闸控跨注意力机制强化可靠视觉线索

Result: 在LRS3数据集上实验，相比AV-HuBERT实现了16.51-42.67%的相对词误率降低，在真实噪声环境下显著提升了系统稳健性

Conclusion: 路由器和闸控机制的结合有效地提升了音视语音识别在噪声环境下的适应性能，为多模态融合提供了一种动态调整模态依赖的有效方法

Abstract: Robust audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) in noisy environments remains
challenging, as existing systems struggle to estimate audio reliability and
dynamically adjust modality reliance. We propose router-gated cross-modal
feature fusion, a novel AVSR framework that adaptively reweights audio and
visual features based on token-level acoustic corruption scores. Using an
audio-visual feature fusion-based router, our method down-weights unreliable
audio tokens and reinforces visual cues through gated cross-attention in each
decoder layer. This enables the model to pivot toward the visual modality when
audio quality deteriorates. Experiments on LRS3 demonstrate that our approach
achieves an 16.51-42.67% relative reduction in word error rate compared to
AV-HuBERT. Ablation studies confirm that both the router and gating mechanism
contribute to improved robustness under real-world acoustic noise.

TL;DR: 新的HOI检测标准评价方案，将HOI检测重构为多选题任务，避免因模糊情景下合理解释被错误扣分的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HOI标准测试集在评估时要求与注释类别完全匹配，而大型生成式VLM模型能够产生多种合理解释，导致合理预测被错误扣分

Method: 重新设计评估协议，将HOI检测转换为多选题任务，每道题包含真实正确选项和细心筛选的负面选项，避免在模糊情况下合理解释被扣分

Result: 提出了首个同时适用于VLM和专门HOI方法的评估协议，支持直接对比两种方法的表现

Conclusion: 该新标准能够更全面评估HOI理解能力，提供了对当前HOI领域进展情况的新视角

Abstract: Prior human-object interaction (HOI) detection methods have integrated early
vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP, but only as supporting components
within their frameworks. In contrast, recent advances in large, generative VLMs
suggest that these models may already possess strong ability to understand
images involving HOI. This naturally raises an important question: can
general-purpose standalone VLMs effectively solve HOI detection, and how do
they compare with specialized HOI methods? Answering this requires a benchmark
that can accommodate both paradigms. However, existing HOI benchmarks such as
HICO-DET were developed before the emergence of modern VLMs, and their
evaluation protocols require exact matches to annotated HOI classes. This is
poorly aligned with the generative nature of VLMs, which often yield multiple
valid interpretations in ambiguous cases. For example, a static image may
capture a person mid-motion with a frisbee, which can plausibly be interpreted
as either "throwing" or "catching". When only "catching" is annotated, the
other, though equally plausible for the image, is marked incorrect when exact
matching is used. As a result, correct predictions might be penalized,
affecting both VLMs and HOI-specific methods. To avoid penalizing valid
predictions, we introduce a new benchmark that reformulates HOI detection as a
multiple-answer multiple-choice task, where each question includes only
ground-truth positive options and a curated set of negatives that are
constructed to reduce ambiguity (e.g., when "catching" is annotated, "throwing"
is not selected as a negative to avoid penalizing valid predictions). The
proposed evaluation protocol is the first of its kind for both VLMs and HOI
methods, enabling direct comparison and offering new insight into the current
state of progress in HOI understanding.

Motivation: 传统选择题生成主要关注文本选项，忽视了视觉选项的重要性，且高质量干扰项的人工制作成本高、扩展性差。需要一种能够生成语义合理且视觉相似的答案和干扰项的方法。

Method: 提出跨模态选项合成(CmOS)框架，整合多模态思维链(MCoT)推理和检索增强生成(RAG)技术，包含内容判别模块来识别适合视觉选项的内容。

Conclusion: CmOS框架成功解决了教育选择题中视觉选项生成的难题，为自动化生成高质量多模态选择题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) play a crucial role in fostering deep
thinking and knowledge integration in education. However, previous research has
primarily focused on generating MCQs with textual options, but it largely
overlooks the visual options. Moreover, generating high-quality distractors
remains a major challenge due to the high cost and limited scalability of
manual authoring. To tackle these problems, we propose a Cross-modal Options
Synthesis (CmOS), a novel framework for generating educational MCQs with visual
options. Our framework integrates Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) reasoning
process and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to produce semantically
plausible and visually similar answer and distractors. It also includes a
discrimination module to identify content suitable for visual options.
Experimental results on test tasks demonstrate the superiority of CmOS in
content discrimination, question generation and visual option generation over
existing methods across various subjects and educational levels.

Abstract: The growing integration of smart environments and low-power computing
devices, coupled with mass-market sensor technologies, is driving advancements
in remote and non-contact physiological monitoring. However, deploying these
systems in real-time on resource-constrained platforms introduces significant
challenges related to scalability, interoperability, and performance. This
paper presents a real-time remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) system optimized
for low-power devices, designed to extract physiological signals, such as heart
rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), and oxygen saturation (SpO2), from facial
video streams. The system is built on the Face2PPG pipeline, which processes
video frames sequentially for rPPG signal extraction and analysis, while
leveraging a multithreaded architecture to manage video capture, real-time
processing, network communication, and graphical user interface (GUI) updates
concurrently. This design ensures continuous, reliable operation at 30 frames
per second (fps), with adaptive feedback through a collaborative user interface
to guide optimal signal capture conditions. The network interface includes both
an HTTP server for continuous video streaming and a RESTful API for on-demand
vital sign retrieval. To ensure accurate performance despite the limitations of
low-power devices, we use a hybrid programming model combining Functional
Reactive Programming (FRP) and the Actor Model, allowing event-driven
processing and efficient task parallelization. The system is evaluated under
real-time constraints, demonstrating robustness while minimizing computational
overhead. Our work addresses key challenges in real-time biosignal monitoring,
offering practical solutions for optimizing performance in modern healthcare

Abstract: Online mapping models show remarkable results in predicting vectorized maps
from multi-view camera images only. However, all existing approaches still rely
on ground-truth high-definition maps during training, which are expensive to
obtain and often not geographically diverse enough for reliable generalization.
In this work, we propose PseudoMapTrainer, a novel approach to online mapping
that uses pseudo-labels generated from unlabeled sensor data. We derive those
pseudo-labels by reconstructing the road surface from multi-camera imagery
using Gaussian splatting and semantics of a pre-trained 2D segmentation
network. In addition, we introduce a mask-aware assignment algorithm and loss
function to handle partially masked pseudo-labels, allowing for the first time
the training of online mapping models without any ground-truth maps.
Furthermore, our pseudo-labels can be effectively used to pre-train an online
model in a semi-supervised manner to leverage large-scale unlabeled
crowdsourced data. The code is available at

Abstract: Effective waste sorting is critical for sustainable recycling, yet AI
research in this domain continues to lag behind commercial systems due to
limited datasets and reliance on legacy object detectors. In this work, we
advance AI-driven waste detection by establishing strong baselines and
introducing an ensemble-based semi-supervised learning framework. We first
benchmark state-of-the-art Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVOD) models on
the real-world ZeroWaste dataset, demonstrating that while class-only prompts
perform poorly, LLM-optimized prompts significantly enhance zero-shot accuracy.
Next, to address domain-specific limitations, we fine-tune modern
transformer-based detectors, achieving a new baseline of 51.6 mAP. We then
propose a soft pseudo-labeling strategy that fuses ensemble predictions using
spatial and consensus-aware weighting, enabling robust semi-supervised
training. Applied to the unlabeled ZeroWaste-s subset, our pseudo-annotations
achieve performance gains that surpass fully supervised training, underscoring
the effectiveness of scalable annotation pipelines. Our work contributes to the
research community by establishing rigorous baselines, introducing a robust
ensemble-based pseudo-labeling pipeline, generating high-quality annotations
for the unlabeled ZeroWaste-s subset, and systematically evaluating OVOD models
under real-world waste sorting conditions. Our code is available at:

Motivation: 不同字体样式传达不同的印象，字体形状与描述这些印象的标签之间存在密切关系。现有的标准词嵌入方法（如BERT和CLIP）在处理印象标签时无法很好地捕捉这种关系。

Method: 构建印象标签共现关系图，节点代表印象标签，边编码共现关系，然后应用谱嵌入技术为每个标签生成印象向量。

Result: 在定性和定量评估中，该方法在印象引导的字体生成任务上表现优于BERT和CLIP方法。

Conclusion: 提出的谱嵌入方法能够更好地捕捉印象标签之间的语义关系，特别适用于基于印象的字体生成和检索任务。

Abstract: Different font styles (i.e., font shapes) convey distinct impressions,
indicating a close relationship between font shapes and word tags describing
those impressions. This paper proposes a novel embedding method for impression
tags that leverages these shape-impression relationships. For instance, our
method assigns similar vectors to impression tags that frequently co-occur in
order to represent impressions of fonts, whereas standard word embedding
methods (e.g., BERT and CLIP) yield very different vectors. This property is
particularly useful for impression-based font generation and font retrieval.
Technically, we construct a graph whose nodes represent impression tags and
whose edges encode co-occurrence relationships. Then, we apply spectral
embedding to obtain the impression vectors for each tag. We compare our method
with BERT and CLIP in qualitative and quantitative evaluations, demonstrating
that our approach performs better in impression-guided font generation.

Abstract: National Forest Inventory (NFI)s serve as the primary source of forest
information, providing crucial tree species distribution data. However,
maintaining these inventories requires labor-intensive on-site campaigns.
Remote sensing approaches, particularly when combined with machine learning,
offer opportunities to update NFIs more frequently and at larger scales. While
the use of Satellite Image Time Series has proven effective for distinguishing
tree species through seasonal canopy reflectance patterns, current approaches
rely primarily on Random Forest classifiers with hand-designed features and
phenology-based metrics. Using deep features from an available pre-trained
remote sensing foundation models offers a complementary strategy. These
pre-trained models leverage unannotated global data and are meant to used for
general-purpose applications and can then be efficiently fine-tuned with
smaller labeled datasets for specific classification tasks. This work
systematically investigates how deep features improve tree species
classification accuracy in the Netherlands with few annotated data. Data-wise,
we extracted time-series data from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and ERA5 satellites
data and SRTM data using Google Earth Engine. Our results demonstrate that
fine-tuning a publicly available remote sensing time series foundation model
outperforms the current state-of-the-art in NFI classification in the
Netherlands by a large margin of up to 10% across all datasets. This
demonstrates that classic hand-defined harmonic features are too simple for
this task and highlights the potential of using deep AI features for
data-limited application like NFI classification. By leveraging openly
available satellite data and pre-trained models, this approach significantly
improves classification accuracy compared to traditional methods and can
effectively complement existing forest inventory processes.

TL;DR: 提出了一种先验引导的视频级回归方法用于微表情分析，通过可扩展区间选择策略和协同优化框架，实现了微表情起始、顶点和偏移阶段的精确检测。


<details>

Motivation: 现有微表情分析方法大多依赖固定窗口大小的窗口级分类，难以捕捉复杂的时序动态。虽然近期方法采用视频级回归框架，但区间解码仍依赖手动预定义的基于窗口的方法。

Method: 提出先验引导的视频级回归方法，包含可扩展区间选择策略（考虑时序演化、持续时间和类别分布特征）和协同优化框架（检测和识别任务共享参数，仅分类头不同）。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上达到最先进性能，CAS(ME)^3数据集STRS为0.0562，SAMMLV数据集STRS为0.2000。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效捕捉微表情的复杂时序动态，充分利用有限数据，提升模型能力，在微表情分析和识别方面表现出色。

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are involuntary, low-intensity, and short-duration
facial expressions that often reveal an individual's genuine thoughts and
emotions. Most existing ME analysis methods rely on window-level classification
with fixed window sizes and hard decisions, which limits their ability to
capture the complex temporal dynamics of MEs. Although recent approaches have
adopted video-level regression frameworks to address some of these challenges,
interval decoding still depends on manually predefined, window-based methods,
leaving the issue only partially mitigated. In this paper, we propose a
prior-guided video-level regression method for ME analysis. We introduce a
scalable interval selection strategy that comprehensively considers the
temporal evolution, duration, and class distribution characteristics of MEs,
enabling precise spotting of the onset, apex, and offset phases. In addition,
we introduce a synergistic optimization framework, in which the spotting and
recognition tasks share parameters except for the classification heads. This
fully exploits complementary information, makes more efficient use of limited
data, and enhances the model's capability. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method,
with an STRS of 0.0562 on CAS(ME)$^3$ and 0.2000 on SAMMLV. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微行网状合术需要高超的技能和训练，但现有评估方法多依赖主观判断，存在偏差和可靠性问题

Method: 利用来自不同医院的三个数据集，通过图像处理技术建立几何错误模型，结合检测和评分机制

Result: 几何指标能够有效地复现专家评分者对错误的评分，提高了评估的效率和可靠性

Conclusion: 该定量框架能够对微行网状合术进行客观、高效的技能评估，推动了训练方案的进步

Abstract: Microsurgical anastomosis demands exceptional dexterity and visuospatial
skills, underscoring the importance of comprehensive training and precise
outcome assessment. Currently, methods such as the outcome-oriented anastomosis
lapse index are used to evaluate this procedure. However, they often rely on
subjective judgment, which can introduce biases that affect the reliability and
efficiency of the assessment of competence. Leveraging three datasets from
hospitals with participants at various levels, we introduce a quantitative
framework that uses image-processing techniques for objective assessment of
microsurgical anastomoses. The approach uses geometric modeling of errors along
with a detection and scoring mechanism, enhancing the efficiency and
reliability of microsurgical proficiency assessment and advancing training
protocols. The results show that the geometric metrics effectively replicate
expert raters' scoring for the errors considered in this work.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的视频稳定方法，通过测试时快速自适应来改进像素级合成视频稳定技术，利用推理时的低层视觉线索提升输出稳定性和视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 像素级合成视频稳定方法虽然能合成全帧输出，但由于视频序列中运动模式和视觉内容的多样性，固定参数难以实现鲁棒泛化。

Method: 采用快速自适应策略，在测试时针对每个输入视频快速调整模型；提出抖动定位模块和针对性自适应策略，重点关注高抖动片段进行优化；利用推理时可用的低层视觉线索。

Result: 即使单次自适应也能获得显著的性能提升，在各种真实数据集上表现出优异的泛化能力，在定性和定量指标上都优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法使现代稳定器能够超越现有SOTA方法，同时保持现代方法的全帧特性，并为用户提供类似经典方法的控制机制，在多样化实际应用中展现出强大性能。

Abstract: Video stabilization remains a fundamental problem in computer vision,
particularly pixel-level synthesis solutions for video stabilization, which
synthesize full-frame outputs, add to the complexity of this task. These
methods aim to enhance stability while synthesizing full-frame videos, but the
inherent diversity in motion profiles and visual content present in each video
sequence makes robust generalization with fixed parameters difficult. To
address this, we present a novel method that improves pixel-level synthesis
video stabilization methods by rapidly adapting models to each input video at
test time. The proposed approach takes advantage of low-level visual cues
available during inference to improve both the stability and visual quality of
the output. Notably, the proposed rapid adaptation achieves significant
performance gains even with a single adaptation pass. We further propose a jerk
localization module and a targeted adaptation strategy, which focuses the
adaptation on high-jerk segments for maximizing stability with fewer adaptation
steps. The proposed methodology enables modern stabilizers to overcome the
longstanding SOTA approaches while maintaining the full frame nature of the
modern methods, while offering users with control mechanisms akin to classical
approaches. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world datasets demonstrate
the versatility of the proposed method. Our approach consistently improves the
performance of various full-frame synthesis models in both qualitative and
quantitative terms, including results on downstream applications.

Motivation: 解决医疗诊断中跨群体公平性问题，特别是在影像设备和临床实践变化导致的分布偏移下，现有方法独立处理视觉和文本模态导致残留的跨模态不对齐和公平性差距。

Method: 采用并行双分支架构分离敏感属性和目标属性，构建近似正交文本锚点引导跨注意力机制，使用超网络生成实例感知视觉提示，并应用基于原型的正则化来增强特征分离和对齐。

Result: 在8个医疗影像数据集和4种模态上的实验表明，DualFairVL在分布内和分布外设置下均实现了最先进的公平性和准确性，仅使用360万可训练参数就超越了全微调和参数高效基线方法。

Conclusion: DualFairVL通过联合去偏和对齐跨模态表示，有效解决了医疗诊断中的公平性问题，特别是在分布偏移场景下表现出色，为公平医疗AI提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Ensuring fairness across demographic groups in medical diagnosis is essential
for equitable healthcare, particularly under distribution shifts caused by
variations in imaging equipment and clinical practice. Vision-language models
(VLMs) exhibit strong generalization, and text prompts encode identity
attributes, enabling explicit identification and removal of sensitive
directions. However, existing debiasing approaches typically address vision and
text modalities independently, leaving residual cross-modal misalignment and
fairness gaps. To address this challenge, we propose DualFairVL, a multimodal
prompt-learning framework that jointly debiases and aligns cross-modal
representations. DualFairVL employs a parallel dual-branch architecture that
separates sensitive and target attributes, enabling disentangled yet aligned
representations across modalities. Approximately orthogonal text anchors are
constructed via linear projections, guiding cross-attention mechanisms to
produce fused features. A hypernetwork further disentangles attribute-related
information and generates instance-aware visual prompts, which encode
dual-modal cues for fairness and robustness. Prototype-based regularization is
applied in the visual branch to enforce separation of sensitive features and
strengthen alignment with textual anchors. Extensive experiments on eight
medical imaging datasets across four modalities show that DualFairVL achieves
state-of-the-art fairness and accuracy under both in- and out-of-distribution
settings, outperforming full fine-tuning and parameter-efficient baselines with
only 3.6M trainable parameters. Code will be released upon publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出双查询增强网络(DQEN)，通过对象感知编码器特征增强对象查询，利用CLIP模型提取语义特征增强交互查询初始化，在HOI检测任务中取得竞争性性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DETR-based HOI检测模型使用随机初始化的查询导致表示模糊，限制了模型效果。人类在HOI类别中是固定的，而对象和交互是可变的，需要针对性地增强查询表示

Method: 1) 使用对象感知编码器特征增强对象查询，使模型能更有效地关注与对象交互的人类；2) 设计交互语义融合模块，利用CLIP模型提取语义特征增强交互查询初始化；3) 引入辅助预测单元改进交互特征表示

Result: 在HICO-Det和V-COCO数据集上取得了竞争性的性能表现

Conclusion: 提出的双查询增强方法有效解决了HOI检测中查询表示模糊的问题，通过分别增强对象和交互查询，显著提升了模型性能

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection focuses on localizing human-object
pairs and recognizing their interactions. Recently, the DETR-based framework
has been widely adopted in HOI detection. In DETR-based HOI models, queries
with clear meaning are crucial for accurately detecting HOIs. However, prior
works have typically relied on randomly initialized queries, leading to vague
representations that limit the model's effectiveness. Meanwhile, humans in the
HOI categories are fixed, while objects and their interactions are variable.
Therefore, we propose a Dual Query Enhancement Network (DQEN) to enhance object
and interaction queries. Specifically, object queries are enhanced with
object-aware encoder features, enabling the model to focus more effectively on
humans interacting with objects in an object-aware way. On the other hand, we
design a novel Interaction Semantic Fusion module to exploit the HOI candidates
that are promoted by the CLIP model. Semantic features are extracted to enhance
the initialization of interaction queries, thereby improving the model's
ability to understand interactions. Furthermore, we introduce an Auxiliary
Prediction Unit aimed at improving the representation of interaction features.
Our proposed method achieves competitive performance on both the HICO-Det and
the V-COCO datasets. The source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 端到端自动驾驶模型虽然能直接从原始数据生成控制命令，但其深度神经网络的非线性决策边界使得决策逻辑难以解释，这在复杂城市场景中尤为关键

Method: 设计损失函数来促进模型可解释性，生成稀疏和局部化的特征图，通过特征激活显示哪些图像区域对预测控制命令有贡献

Result: 在CARLA基准测试中，单目非集成模型超越了排行榜上的顶级方法，实现了更低的事故分数和最高的路线完成率

Conclusion: 该方法成功提升了自动驾驶模型的可解释性，同时优化了控制命令，可解释性的提升与减少事故行为相关，产生了更安全的高性能驾驶模型

Abstract: Trustworthy AI is mandatory for the broad deployment of autonomous vehicles.
Although end-to-end approaches derive control commands directly from raw data,
interpreting these decisions remains challenging, especially in complex urban
scenarios. This is mainly attributed to very deep neural networks with
non-linear decision boundaries, making it challenging to grasp the logic behind
AI-driven decisions. This paper presents a method to enhance interpretability
while optimizing control commands in autonomous driving. To address this, we
propose loss functions that promote the interpretability of our model by
generating sparse and localized feature maps. The feature activations allow us
to explain which image regions contribute to the predicted control command. We
conduct comprehensive ablation studies on the feature extraction step and
validate our method on the CARLA benchmarks. We also demonstrate that our
approach improves interpretability, which correlates with reducing infractions,
yielding a safer, high-performance driving model. Notably, our monocular,
non-ensemble model surpasses the top-performing approaches from the CARLA
Leaderboard by achieving lower infraction scores and the highest route
completion rate, all while ensuring interpretability.

Abstract: The Event-Enriched Image Analysis (EVENTA) Grand Challenge, hosted at ACM
Multimedia 2025, introduces the first large-scale benchmark for event-level
multimodal understanding. Traditional captioning and retrieval tasks largely
focus on surface-level recognition of people, objects, and scenes, often
overlooking the contextual and semantic dimensions that define real-world
events. EVENTA addresses this gap by integrating contextual, temporal, and
semantic information to capture the who, when, where, what, and why behind an
image. Built upon the OpenEvents V1 dataset, the challenge features two tracks:
Event-Enriched Image Retrieval and Captioning, and Event-Based Image Retrieval.
A total of 45 teams from six countries participated, with evaluation conducted
through Public and Private Test phases to ensure fairness and reproducibility.
The top three teams were invited to present their solutions at ACM Multimedia
2025. EVENTA establishes a foundation for context-aware, narrative-driven

Conclusion: 该研究为可扩展的行人行为分析提供了基础框架，未来版本将完成对提出指标的完整量化分析及其在人群动力学研究中的应用

Abstract: This study presents an initial framework for distinguishing group and single
pedestrians based on real-world trajectory data, with the aim of analyzing
their differences in space utilization and emergent behavioral patterns. By
segmenting pedestrian trajectories into fixed time bins and applying a
Transformer-based pair classification model, we identify cohesive groups and
isolate single pedestrians over a structured sequence-based filtering process.
To prepare for deeper analysis, we establish a comprehensive metric framework
incorporating both spatial and behavioral dimensions. Spatial utilization
metrics include convex hull area, smallest enclosing circle radius, and
heatmap-based spatial densities to characterize how different pedestrian types
occupy and interact with space. Behavioral metrics such as velocity change,
motion angle deviation, clearance radius, and trajectory straightness are
designed to capture local adaptations and responses during interactions.
Furthermore, we introduce a typology of encounter types-single-to-single,
single-to-group, and group-to-group to categorize and later quantify different
interaction scenarios. Although this version focuses primarily on the
classification pipeline and dataset structuring, it establishes the groundwork
for scalable analysis across different sequence lengths 60, 100, and 200
frames. Future versions will incorporate complete quantitative analysis of the
proposed metrics and their implications for pedestrian simulation and space
design validation in crowd dynamics research.

Abstract: Monitoring coral reefs at large spatial scales remains an open challenge,
essential for assessing ecosystem health and informing conservation efforts.
While drone-based aerial imagery offers broad spatial coverage, its limited
resolution makes it difficult to reliably distinguish fine-scale classes, such
as coral morphotypes. At the same time, obtaining pixel-level annotations over
large spatial extents is costly and labor-intensive, limiting the scalability
of deep learning-based segmentation methods for aerial imagery. We present a
multi-scale weakly supervised semantic segmentation framework that addresses
this challenge by transferring fine-scale ecological information from
underwater imagery to aerial data. Our method enables large-scale coral reef
mapping from drone imagery with minimal manual annotation, combining
classification-based supervision, spatial interpolation and self-distillation
techniques. We demonstrate the efficacy of the approach, enabling large-area
segmentation of coral morphotypes and demonstrating flexibility for integrating
new classes. This study presents a scalable, cost-effective methodology for
high-resolution reef monitoring, combining low-cost data collection, weakly
supervised deep learning and multi-scale remote sensing.

Abstract: Traditional map-making relies heavily on Geographic Information Systems
(GIS), requiring domain expertise and being time-consuming, especially for
repetitive tasks. Recent advances in generative AI (GenAI), particularly image
diffusion models, offer new opportunities for automating and democratizing the
map-making process. However, these models struggle with accurate map creation
due to limited control over spatial composition and semantic layout. To address
this, we integrate vector data to guide map generation in different styles,
specified by the textual prompts. Our model is the first to generate accurate
maps in controlled styles, and we have integrated it into a web application to
improve its usability and accessibility. We conducted a user study with
professional cartographers to assess the fidelity of generated maps, the
usability of the web application, and the implications of ever-emerging GenAI
in map-making. The findings have suggested the potential of our developed
application and, more generally, the GenAI models in helping both non-expert
users and professionals in creating maps more efficiently. We have also
outlined further technical improvements and emphasized the new role of
cartographers to advance the paradigm of AI-assisted map-making.

<details>

Motivation: 现有文献通常将风格驱动和主体驱动的生成视为两个独立任务，存在明显的对抗性。作者认为这两个目标可以在单一框架下统一，因为它们都涉及内容和风格的解耦与重组。

Method: 1) 构建大规模三元组数据集；2) 引入解耦学习方案，通过风格对齐训练和内容-风格解耦训练同时对齐风格特征并解耦内容与风格；3) 采用风格奖励学习(SRL)范式进一步提升性能；4) 发布首个联合评估风格相似性和主体保真度的基准USO-Bench。

Conclusion: USO成功地将风格驱动和主体驱动的生成任务统一到一个框架中，通过内容和风格的解耦与重组，在两个目标上都取得了优异的表现。

Abstract: Existing literature typically treats style-driven and subject-driven
generation as two disjoint tasks: the former prioritizes stylistic similarity,
whereas the latter insists on subject consistency, resulting in an apparent
antagonism. We argue that both objectives can be unified under a single
framework because they ultimately concern the disentanglement and
re-composition of content and style, a long-standing theme in style-driven
research. To this end, we present USO, a Unified Style-Subject Optimized
customization model. First, we construct a large-scale triplet dataset
consisting of content images, style images, and their corresponding stylized
content images. Second, we introduce a disentangled learning scheme that
simultaneously aligns style features and disentangles content from style
through two complementary objectives, style-alignment training and
content-style disentanglement training. Third, we incorporate a style
reward-learning paradigm denoted as SRL to further enhance the model's
performance. Finally, we release USO-Bench, the first benchmark that jointly
evaluates style similarity and subject fidelity across multiple metrics.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that USO achieves state-of-the-art
performance among open-source models along both dimensions of subject
consistency and style similarity. Code and model:

Result: ppNeSF在视觉定位任务中达到state-of-the-art性能，同时有效保护隐私

Conclusion: 通过分割监督训练的NeRF变体能够在保护隐私的前提下实现准确的视觉定位，为云基定位服务提供隐私保护解决方案

Abstract: Visual localization (VL) is the task of estimating the camera pose in a known
scene. VL methods, a.o., can be distinguished based on how they represent the
scene, e.g., explicitly through a (sparse) point cloud or a collection of
images or implicitly through the weights of a neural network. Recently,
NeRF-based methods have become popular for VL. While NeRFs offer high-quality
novel view synthesis, they inadvertently encode fine scene details, raising
privacy concerns when deployed in cloud-based localization services as
sensitive information could be recovered. In this paper, we tackle this
challenge on two ends. We first propose a new protocol to assess
privacy-preservation of NeRF-based representations. We show that NeRFs trained
with photometric losses store fine-grained details in their geometry
representations, making them vulnerable to privacy attacks, even if the head
that predicts colors is removed. Second, we propose ppNeSF (Privacy-Preserving
Neural Segmentation Field), a NeRF variant trained with segmentation
supervision instead of RGB images. These segmentation labels are learned in a
self-supervised manner, ensuring they are coarse enough to obscure identifiable
scene details while remaining discriminativeness in 3D. The segmentation space
of ppNeSF can be used for accurate visual localization, yielding
state-of-the-art results.

*Eric López,Artemis Llabrés,Ernest Valveny*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了在文档视觉问答中引入检索增强生成(RAG)的效果，通过文本检索和纯视觉检索两种变体，在多个多页数据集上显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文档VQA系统要么拼接所有页面，要么依赖大型视觉语言模型，都存在内存消耗大的问题。RAG通过先检索相关片段再生成答案的方式提供了更高效的替代方案。

Method: 采用两种检索变体：基于OCR令牌的文本检索和无需OCR的纯视觉检索。在MP-DocVQA、DUDE和InfographicVQA等多页数据集上进行评估，并分析了检索、重排序和布局引导分块策略的影响。

Result: 文本中心变体相比"拼接所有页面"基线提升了最多+22.5 ANLS，视觉变体在不需文本提取的情况下实现了+5.0 ANLS的改进。检索和重排序组件是性能提升的主要驱动力。

Conclusion: 仔细的证据选择能够持续提升多页文档VQA的准确性，证明了RAG在实际应用中的实用价值，且适用于不同规模的模型和多页基准测试。

Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (Document VQA) must cope with documents
that span dozens of pages, yet leading systems still concatenate every page or
rely on very large vision-language models, both of which are memory-hungry.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers an attractive alternative, first
retrieving a concise set of relevant segments before generating answers from
this selected evidence. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the impact of
incorporating RAG into Document VQA through different retrieval variants -
text-based retrieval using OCR tokens and purely visual retrieval without OCR -
across multiple models and benchmarks. Evaluated on the multi-page datasets
MP-DocVQA, DUDE, and InfographicVQA, the text-centric variant improves the
"concatenate-all-pages" baseline by up to +22.5 ANLS, while the visual variant
achieves +5.0 ANLS improvement without requiring any text extraction. An
ablation confirms that retrieval and reranking components drive most of the
gain, whereas the layout-guided chunking strategy - proposed in several recent
works to leverage page structure - fails to help on these datasets. Our
experiments demonstrate that careful evidence selection consistently boosts
accuracy across multiple model sizes and multi-page benchmarks, underscoring
its practical value for real-world Document VQA.

TL;DR: GRAS是一个用于评估视觉语言模型(VLMs)人口统计学偏见的基准测试，涵盖性别、种族、年龄和肤色等多个维度，并提出可解释的GRAS偏见评分指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型在现实应用中的普及，理解其人口统计学偏见变得至关重要，需要系统性的评估框架来量化这些偏见。

Method: 提出GRAS基准测试，包含最多样化的人口统计学覆盖范围，并设计GRAS偏见评分这一可解释的量化指标。通过视觉问答(VQA)任务评估五个最先进的VLMs模型。

Result: 评估结果显示所有模型都存在令人担忧的偏见水平，表现最好的模型GRAS偏见评分仅为2分(满分100分)。研究发现评估VQA偏见时需要考虑问题的多种表述方式。

Conclusion: GRAS基准测试揭示了当前VLMs存在显著的人口统计学偏见，强调了在模型评估中考虑多种问题表述的重要性，为未来偏见缓解研究提供了重要基础。

Abstract: As Vision Language Models (VLMs) become integral to real-world applications,
understanding their demographic biases is critical. We introduce GRAS, a
benchmark for uncovering demographic biases in VLMs across gender, race, age,
and skin tone, offering the most diverse coverage to date. We further propose
the GRAS Bias Score, an interpretable metric for quantifying bias. We benchmark
five state-of-the-art VLMs and reveal concerning bias levels, with the least
biased model attaining a GRAS Bias Score of only 2 out of 100. Our findings
also reveal a methodological insight: evaluating bias in VLMs with visual
question answering (VQA) requires considering multiple formulations of a
question. Our code, data, and evaluation results are publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法存在三个问题：非真正端到端导致分割结果非最优；边缘点特征判别性低导致边缘不准确；平面几何特性未充分约束网络训练。

Method: 采用Transformer编码器-解码器框架，使用可学习平面查询预测实例掩码；设计边缘感知掩码模块(EAMM)融入几何先验；提出自适应权重掩码损失和平面几何损失约束训练。

Result: 实现了真正端到端的屋顶平面分割，提升了边缘区域的分割精度，通过几何约束改善了网络训练效果。

Conclusion: RoofSeg网络有效解决了当前深度学习方法在屋顶平面分割中的三个关键问题，实现了更准确和鲁棒的屋顶平面分割性能。

Abstract: Roof plane segmentation is one of the key procedures for reconstructing
three-dimensional (3D) building models at levels of detail (LoD) 2 and 3 from
airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds. The majority of
current approaches for roof plane segmentation rely on the manually designed or
learned features followed by some specifically designed geometric clustering
strategies. Because the learned features are more powerful than the manually
designed features, the deep learning-based approaches usually perform better
than the traditional approaches. However, the current deep learning-based
approaches have three unsolved problems. The first is that most of them are not
truly end-to-end, the plane segmentation results may be not optimal. The second
is that the point feature discriminability near the edges is relatively low,
leading to inaccurate planar edges. The third is that the planar geometric
characteristics are not sufficiently considered to constrain the network
training. To solve these issues, a novel edge-aware transformer-based network,
named RoofSeg, is developed for segmenting roof planes from LiDAR point clouds
in a truly end-to-end manner. In the RoofSeg, we leverage a transformer
encoder-decoder-based framework to hierarchically predict the plane instance
masks with the use of a set of learnable plane queries. To further improve the
segmentation accuracy of edge regions, we also design an Edge-Aware Mask Module
(EAMM) that sufficiently incorporates planar geometric prior of edges to
enhance its discriminability for plane instance mask refinement. In addition,
we propose an adaptive weighting strategy in the mask loss to reduce the
influence of misclassified points, and also propose a new plane geometric loss
to constrain the network training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微塑料污染已成为全球急诫问题，可导致肝脏感染、肠道伤害等健康风险，需要有效检测方法

Method: 采用Nile Red染料染色和莖光显微镜技术，构建MicroDetect-Net深度学习模型，通过卷积神经网络进行图像分割和微塑料定位计数

Result: 在276张莖光血液图像数据集上，模型准确率达92%，IoU为87.4%，F1分数92.1%，精度90.6%，召回率93.7%

Conclusion: MicroDetect-Net模型在微塑料检测中表现优异，为人类血液样本微塑料监测提供了有效技术路径

Abstract: With the prevalence of plastics exceeding 368 million tons yearly,
microplastic pollution has grown to an extent where air, water, soil, and
living organisms have all tested positive for microplastic presence. These
particles, which are smaller than 5 millimeters in size, are no less harmful to
humans than to the environment. Toxicity research on microplastics has shown
that exposure may cause liver infection, intestinal injuries, and gut flora
imbalance, leading to numerous potential health hazards. This paper presents a
new model, MicroDetect-Net (MDN), which applies fluorescence microscopy with
Nile Red dye staining and deep learning to scan blood samples for
microplastics. Although clam blood has certain limitations in replicating real
human blood, this study opens avenues for applying the approach to human
samples, which are more consistent for preliminary data collection. The MDN
model integrates dataset preparation, fluorescence imaging, and segmentation
using a convolutional neural network to localize and count microplastic
fragments. The combination of convolutional networks and Nile Red dye for
segmentation produced strong image detection and accuracy. MDN was evaluated on
a dataset of 276 Nile Red-stained fluorescent blood images and achieved an
accuracy of ninety two percent. Robust performance was observed with an
Intersection over Union of 87.4 percent, F1 score of 92.1 percent, Precision of
90.6 percent, and Recall of 93.7 percent. These metrics demonstrate the
effectiveness of MDN in the detection of microplastics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 部分相关视频检索(PRVR)是一个实用但具有挑战性的任务，现有方法主要处理单模态特征，而强大的预训练视觉-语言模型如CLIP在该领域尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出了ProPy模型，包含两个关键创新：(1)提示金字塔结构，组织事件提示以捕获多粒度语义；(2)祖先-后代交互机制，实现事件间的动态语义交互。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上实现了最先进的性能，显著超越了之前的模型。

Conclusion: ProPy通过系统性地适配CLIP架构，为PRVR任务提供了有效的解决方案，证明了预训练视觉-语言模型在该领域的潜力。

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) is a practical yet challenging task
that involves retrieving videos based on queries relevant to only specific
segments. While existing works follow the paradigm of developing models to
process unimodal features, powerful pretrained vision-language models like CLIP
remain underexplored in this field. To bridge this gap, we propose ProPy, a
model with systematic architectural adaption of CLIP specifically designed for
PRVR. Drawing insights from the semantic relevance of multi-granularity events,
ProPy introduces two key innovations: (1) A Prompt Pyramid structure that
organizes event prompts to capture semantics at multiple granularity levels,
and (2) An Ancestor-Descendant Interaction Mechanism built on the pyramid that
enables dynamic semantic interaction among events. With these designs, ProPy
achieves SOTA performance on three public datasets, outperforming previous
models by significant margins. Code is available at

TL;DR: 该研究利用8449个3D血管几何模型进行自监督预训练，学习几何表征，然后在小规模临床数据（49名患者）上提升冠状动脉壁剪切应力评估的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗大数据在心血管健康等领域应用前景广阔，但获取足够数据训练机器学习模型极具挑战。冠状动脉血流动力学生物标志物评估缺乏大规模数据集支持，需要解决数据稀缺问题。

Method: 使用8449个3D血管几何模型数据集，通过计算热核签名（基于拉普拉斯特征向量）创建自监督目标，学习几何表征，然后将这些表征应用于小规模临床数据（49名患者）的壁剪切应力评估。

Result: 研究表明，从大规模几何数据集中学习的几何表征能够显著提升冠状动脉壁剪切应力区域（低、中、高）的分割准确性，即使在有限数据条件下也能获得良好效果。

Conclusion: 自监督预训练和基础模型能够有效解决医疗数据稀缺问题，从大规模几何数据集中学习的表征可以显著改善小规模临床数据上的血流动力学生物标志物评估性能。

Abstract: Leveraging big data for patient care is promising in many medical fields such
as cardiovascular health. For example, hemodynamic biomarkers like wall shear
stress could be assessed from patient-specific medical images via machine
learning algorithms, bypassing the need for time-intensive computational fluid
simulation. However, it is extremely challenging to amass large-enough datasets
to effectively train such models. We could address this data scarcity by means
of self-supervised pre-training and foundations models given large datasets of
geometric artery models. In the context of coronary arteries, leveraging
learned representations to improve hemodynamic biomarker assessment has not yet
been well studied. In this work, we address this gap by investigating whether a
large dataset (8449 shapes) consisting of geometric models of 3D blood vessels
can benefit wall shear stress assessment in coronary artery models from a
small-scale clinical trial (49 patients). We create a self-supervised target
for the 3D blood vessels by computing the heat kernel signature, a quantity
obtained via Laplacian eigenvectors, which captures the very essence of the
shapes. We show how geometric representations learned from this datasets can
boost segmentation of coronary arteries into regions of low, mid and high
(time-averaged) wall shear stress even when trained on limited data.

Motivation: 现有表面缺陷检测方法无法满足工业对高性能、效率和适应性的需求，特别是在处理不同数据标注场景时存在局限性。

Method: 基于SimpleNet构建，引入新颖的合成异常生成过程、增强的分类头和改进的学习过程，支持四种监督场景的统一训练。

Result: 在四个具有挑战性的基准数据集上达到最先进性能，推理时间低于10毫秒，是首个能够充分利用所有可用数据标注的模型。

Conclusion: SuperSimpleNet通过统一不同监督范式同时保持出色的速度和可靠性，为弥合学术研究与工业应用之间的差距迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Surface defect detection is a critical task across numerous industries, aimed
at efficiently identifying and localising imperfections or irregularities on
manufactured components. While numerous methods have been proposed, many fail
to meet industrial demands for high performance, efficiency, and adaptability.
Existing approaches are often constrained to specific supervision scenarios and
struggle to adapt to the diverse data annotations encountered in real-world
manufacturing processes, such as unsupervised, weakly supervised, mixed
supervision, and fully supervised settings. To address these challenges, we
propose SuperSimpleNet, a highly efficient and adaptable discriminative model
built on the foundation of SimpleNet. SuperSimpleNet incorporates a novel
synthetic anomaly generation process, an enhanced classification head, and an
improved learning procedure, enabling efficient training in all four
supervision scenarios, making it the first model capable of fully leveraging
all available data annotations. SuperSimpleNet sets a new standard for
performance across all scenarios, as demonstrated by its results on four
challenging benchmark datasets. Beyond accuracy, it is very fast, achieving an
inference time below 10 ms. With its ability to unify diverse supervision
paradigms while maintaining outstanding speed and reliability, SuperSimpleNet
represents a promising step forward in addressing real-world manufacturing
challenges and bridging the gap between academic research and industrial
applications. Code: https://github.com/blaz-r/SuperSimpleNet

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件盘在固定照明和静态/低运动场景中无法产生事件，限制了在计算机视觉任务中的应用。需要一种简单有效的方法维持持续事件产生。

Method: 使用简单的旋转不平衡质量产生周期性震动，结合运动补偿管线去除注入的震动，产生清晰的经运动校正的事件数据。

Result: 在实际采集的数据集上评估，方法可靠地恢复运动参数，在图像重建和边缘检测任务上都比无运动引入的事件感知更好。

Conclusion: 该轻量级方法通过震动引入有效解决了事件盘在静态场景中的限制，为下游感知任务提供了更好的事件数据质量。

Abstract: Event cameras are a bio-inspired class of sensors that asynchronously measure
per-pixel intensity changes. Under fixed illumination conditions in static or
low-motion scenes, rigidly mounted event cameras are unable to generate any
events, becoming unsuitable for most computer vision tasks. To address this
limitation, recent work has investigated motion-induced event stimulation that
often requires complex hardware or additional optical components. In contrast,
we introduce a lightweight approach to sustain persistent event generation by
employing a simple rotating unbalanced mass to induce periodic vibrational
motion. This is combined with a motion-compensation pipeline that removes the
injected motion and yields clean, motion-corrected events for downstream
perception tasks. We demonstrate our approach with a hardware prototype and
evaluate it on real-world captured datasets. Our method reliably recovers
motion parameters and improves both image reconstruction and edge detection
over event-based sensing without motion induction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史文档的文本行分割需要大量注释数据，而这些数据的注释需要专业知识且成本高、劳动密集，因此需要少样本学习方法来降低数据需求。

Method: 采用轻量级UNet++模型结合拓扑感知损失函数，显式惩罚线条碎片化和意外合并等结构错误。仅从每个手稿中提取3个注释页面提取小补丁进行训练。

Result: 在U-DIADS-TL数据集上识别准确率提高200%，线条交并比提高75%，F-Measure分数超过或与DIVA-HisDB基准检测竞赛冠军相当，仅需3个注释页面。

Conclusion: 小型简单的网络结构结合拓扑感知损失函数能够在极少注释数据下实现高效准确的历史文档文本行分割，为少样本学习领域提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: A foundational task for the digital analysis of documents is text line
segmentation. However, automating this process with deep learning models is
challenging because it requires large, annotated datasets that are often
unavailable for historical documents. Additionally, the annotation process is a
labor- and cost-intensive task that requires expert knowledge, which makes
few-shot learning a promising direction for reducing data requirements. In this
work, we demonstrate that small and simple architectures, coupled with a
topology-aware loss function, are more accurate and data-efficient than more
complex alternatives. We pair a lightweight UNet++ with a connectivity-aware
loss, initially developed for neuron morphology, which explicitly penalizes
structural errors like line fragmentation and unintended line merges. To
increase our limited data, we train on small patches extracted from a mere
three annotated pages per manuscript. Our methodology significantly improves
upon the current state-of-the-art on the U-DIADS-TL dataset, with a 200%
increase in Recognition Accuracy and a 75% increase in Line Intersection over
Union. Our method also achieves an F-Measure score on par with or even
exceeding that of the competition winner of the DIVA-HisDB baseline detection
task, all while requiring only three annotated pages, exemplifying the efficacy
of our approach. Our implementation is publicly available at:

TL;DR: 本文针对单目3D视觉定位任务中预训练语言模型对数值单位不敏感的问题，提出了两种简单有效的3D文本增强方法，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在文本描述中包含几何信息时，文本嵌入对数值大小敏感但忽略测量单位，导致即使物理长度相同但单位不同时性能严重下降，表明预训练语言模型的3D理解能力较弱。

Method: 提出两种方法：1) 3D文本增强(3DTE)预处理方法，通过增加距离描述符多样性来增强不同单位间映射关系的理解；2) 文本引导几何增强(TGE)模块，将基础文本特征投影到几何一致空间，用3D增强的文本特征精确引导几何特征的注意力。

Result: 在Mono3DRefer数据集上的实验表明，该方法相比之前方法有显著改进，在"Far"场景中实现了11.94%的显著准确率提升，达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: 通过增强文本嵌入的3D感知能力和几何特征，有效解决了预训练语言模型在3D理解方面的局限性，为单目3D视觉定位任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Monocular 3D visual grounding is a novel task that aims to locate 3D objects
in RGB images using text descriptions with explicit geometry information.
Despite the inclusion of geometry details in the text, we observe that the text
embeddings are sensitive to the magnitude of numerical values but largely
ignore the associated measurement units. For example, simply equidistant
mapping the length with unit "meter" to "decimeters" or "centimeters" leads to
severe performance degradation, even though the physical length remains
equivalent. This observation signifies the weak 3D comprehension of pre-trained
language model, which generates misguiding text features to hinder 3D
perception. Therefore, we propose to enhance the 3D perception of model on text
embeddings and geometry features with two simple and effective methods.
Firstly, we introduce a pre-processing method named 3D-text Enhancement (3DTE),
which enhances the comprehension of mapping relationships between different
units by augmenting the diversity of distance descriptors in text queries.
Next, we propose a Text-Guided Geometry Enhancement (TGE) module to further
enhance the 3D-text information by projecting the basic text features into
geometrically consistent space. These 3D-enhanced text features are then
leveraged to precisely guide the attention of geometry features. We evaluate
the proposed method through extensive comparisons and ablation studies on the
Mono3DRefer dataset. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements
over previous methods, achieving new state-of-the-art results with a notable
accuracy gain of 11.94\% in the "Far" scenario. Our code will be made publicly
available.

TL;DR: 提出基于Weierstrass椭圆函数的位置编码方法(WEF-PE)，通过复数域表示直接处理二维坐标，利用椭圆函数的双周期性和几何特性更好地编码空间距离关系，在多个视觉任务上取得优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Vision Transformer使用的一维位置编码破坏了图像的二维空间结构，缺乏几何约束，无法建立欧几里得空间距离与序列索引距离之间的单调对应关系，限制了模型利用空间邻近先验的能力。

Method: 提出Weierstrass椭圆函数位置编码(WEF-PE)，利用椭圆函数的双周期性与视觉数据中的平移不变性模式相匹配，通过复数域表示直接编码二维坐标，利用椭圆函数的非线性几何特性和代数加法公式推导相对位置信息。

Result: 在多个基准测试中取得优异性能：ViT-Tiny在CIFAR-100从头训练达到63.78%准确率，ViT-Base在CIFAR-100微调达到93.28%准确率，在VTAB-1k基准任务上持续改进。理论分析证实了距离衰减特性，注意力可视化显示增强的几何归纳偏置和更连贯的语义聚焦。

Conclusion: WEF-PE是一种数学原理严谨的位置编码方法，能够有效处理二维空间结构，通过椭圆函数的几何特性自然编码空间距离关系，在视觉任务中表现出优越的性能和更好的几何归纳偏置。

Abstract: Vision Transformers have demonstrated remarkable success in computer vision
tasks, yet their reliance on learnable one-dimensional positional embeddings
fundamentally disrupts the inherent two-dimensional spatial structure of images
through patch flattening procedures. Traditional positional encoding approaches
lack geometric constraints and fail to establish monotonic correspondence
between Euclidean spatial distances and sequential index distances, thereby
limiting the model's capacity to leverage spatial proximity priors effectively.
We propose Weierstrass Elliptic Function Positional Encoding (WEF-PE), a
mathematically principled approach that directly addresses two-dimensional
coordinates through natural complex domain representation, where the doubly
periodic properties of elliptic functions align remarkably with translational
invariance patterns commonly observed in visual data. Our method exploits the
non-linear geometric nature of elliptic functions to encode spatial distance
relationships naturally, while the algebraic addition formula enables direct
derivation of relative positional information between arbitrary patch pairs
from their absolute encodings. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
WEF-PE achieves superior performance across diverse scenarios, including
63.78\% accuracy on CIFAR-100 from-scratch training with ViT-Tiny architecture,
93.28\% on CIFAR-100 fine-tuning with ViT-Base, and consistent improvements on
VTAB-1k benchmark tasks. Theoretical analysis confirms the distance-decay
property through rigorous mathematical proof, while attention visualization
reveals enhanced geometric inductive bias and more coherent semantic focus
compared to conventional approaches.The source code implementing the methods
described in this paper is publicly available on GitHub.

### [67] [FastMesh:Efficient Artistic Mesh Generation via Component Decoupling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19188)
*Jeonghwan Kim,Yushi Lan,Armando Fortes,Yongwei Chen,Xingang Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种高效的网格生成框架，通过分离生成顶点和面片，大幅减少了令片序列的冗余，实现了8倍的生成速度提升和更高的网格质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的网格生成方法将三角网格转换为令片序列，但因为顶点被多个面共享而导致令片序列过长和生成效率低下。

Method: 采用自回归模型生成顶点（减少4倍令片），然后用双向Transformer一步完成面片构建，加上保真增强器精细顶点位置和后处理清除不良连接。

Result: 方法实现了8倍的生成速度提升，产生的网格质量更高，令片数量减少到现有最紧凑方法的23%。

Conclusion: 该框架通过分离顶点和面片生成，有效解决了网格令片化中的冗余问题，在保持高质量的同时大幅提升了生成效率。

Abstract: Recent mesh generation approaches typically tokenize triangle meshes into
sequences of tokens and train autoregressive models to generate these tokens
sequentially. Despite substantial progress, such token sequences inevitably
reuse vertices multiple times to fully represent manifold meshes, as each
vertex is shared by multiple faces. This redundancy leads to excessively long
token sequences and inefficient generation processes. In this paper, we propose
an efficient framework that generates artistic meshes by treating vertices and
faces separately, significantly reducing redundancy. We employ an
autoregressive model solely for vertex generation, decreasing the token count
to approximately 23\% of that required by the most compact existing tokenizer.
Next, we leverage a bidirectional transformer to complete the mesh in a single
step by capturing inter-vertex relationships and constructing the adjacency
matrix that defines the mesh faces. To further improve the generation quality,
we introduce a fidelity enhancer to refine vertex positioning into more natural
arrangements and propose a post-processing framework to remove undesirable edge
connections. Experimental results show that our method achieves more than
8$\times$ faster speed on mesh generation compared to state-of-the-art
approaches, while producing higher mesh quality.

### [68] [All-in-One Slider for Attribute Manipulation in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19195)
*Weixin Ye,Hongguang Zhu,Wei Wang,Yahui Liu,Mengyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出All-in-One Slider方法，通过将文本嵌入空间分解为稀疏的语义属性方向，实现单一轻量模块对多种属性的精细控制，支持零样本属性操作和多属性组合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的T2I扩散模型在渐进式属性操控方面存在挑战，特别是对于人脸等细节丰富的内容。传统方法需要为每个属性单独训练滑块模块，导致参数冗余且缺乏灵活性。

Method: 开发轻量级的All-in-One Slider模块，将文本嵌入空间分解为稀疏的语义属性方向，训练后可作为通用滑块使用，支持多种属性的精确连续控制。

Result: 实验表明该方法能够实现准确且可扩展的属性操控，相比之前方法有显著改进，并能与反演框架结合处理真实图像。

Conclusion: All-in-One Slider方法解决了传统One-for-One方式的局限性，提供了更灵活、可扩展的属性操控方案，适用于各种实际应用场景。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have made significant strides in
generating high-quality images. However, progressively manipulating certain
attributes of generated images to meet the desired user expectations remains
challenging, particularly for content with rich details, such as human faces.
Some studies have attempted to address this by training slider modules.
However, they follow a One-for-One manner, where an independent slider is
trained for each attribute, requiring additional training whenever a new
attribute is introduced. This not only results in parameter redundancy
accumulated by sliders but also restricts the flexibility of practical
applications and the scalability of attribute manipulation. To address this
issue, we introduce the All-in-One Slider, a lightweight module that decomposes
the text embedding space into sparse, semantically meaningful attribute
directions. Once trained, it functions as a general-purpose slider, enabling
interpretable and fine-grained continuous control over various attributes.
Moreover, by recombining the learned directions, the All-in-One Slider supports
zero-shot manipulation of unseen attributes (e.g., races and celebrities) and
the composition of multiple attributes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method enables accurate and scalable attribute manipulation, achieving
notable improvements compared to previous methods. Furthermore, our method can
be extended to integrate with the inversion framework to perform attribute
manipulation on real images, broadening its applicability to various real-world
scenarios. The code and trained model will be released at:

### [69] [OmniHuman-1.5: Instilling an Active Mind in Avatars via Cognitive Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19209)
*Jianwen Jiang,Weihong Zeng,Zerong Zheng,Jiaqi Yang,Chao Liang,Wang Liao,Han Liang,Yuan Zhang,Mingyuan Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniHuman-1.5是一个视频角色动画生成框架，通过多模态大语言模型提供高级语义指导，结合专门的Multimodal DiT架构，生成既物理合理又语义连贯的富有表现力的角色动画。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频角色模型只能产生物理相似的动作，但缺乏对情感、意图和上下文的深层语义理解，通常只与音频节奏等低级线索同步，无法捕捉角色的真实本质。

Method: 1. 利用多模态大语言模型合成结构化文本表示，提供高级语义指导；2. 引入具有Pseudo Last Frame设计的专门Multimodal DiT架构，有效融合多模态输入并缓解模态间冲突。

Result: 模型在唇形同步准确性、视频质量、运动自然度和与文本提示的语义一致性等综合指标上达到领先性能，并在多人和非人类角色等复杂场景中表现出卓越的可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合高级语义指导和专门的多模态融合架构，成功生成了物理合理且语义连贯的富有表现力的角色动画，超越了简单的节奏同步，实现了对角色、场景和语言内容的深度一致性。

Abstract: Existing video avatar models can produce fluid human animations, yet they
struggle to move beyond mere physical likeness to capture a character's
authentic essence. Their motions typically synchronize with low-level cues like
audio rhythm, lacking a deeper semantic understanding of emotion, intent, or
context. To bridge this gap, \textbf{we propose a framework designed to
generate character animations that are not only physically plausible but also
semantically coherent and expressive.} Our model, \textbf{OmniHuman-1.5}, is
built upon two key technical contributions. First, we leverage Multimodal Large
Language Models to synthesize a structured textual representation of conditions
that provides high-level semantic guidance. This guidance steers our motion
generator beyond simplistic rhythmic synchronization, enabling the production
of actions that are contextually and emotionally resonant. Second, to ensure
the effective fusion of these multimodal inputs and mitigate inter-modality
conflicts, we introduce a specialized Multimodal DiT architecture with a novel
Pseudo Last Frame design. The synergy of these components allows our model to
accurately interpret the joint semantics of audio, images, and text, thereby
generating motions that are deeply coherent with the character, scene, and
linguistic content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves
leading performance across a comprehensive set of metrics, including lip-sync
accuracy, video quality, motion naturalness and semantic consistency with
textual prompts. Furthermore, our approach shows remarkable extensibility to
complex scenarios, such as those involving multi-person and non-human subjects.

### [70] [Automated Feature Tracking for Real-Time Kinematic Analysis and Shape Estimation of Carbon Nanotube Growth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19232)
*Kaveh Safavigerdini,Ramakrishna Surya,Jaired Collins,Prasad Calyam,Filiz Bunyak,Matthew R. Maschmann,Kannappan Palaniappan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VFTrack是一个实时原位粒子追踪框架，用于自动检测和跟踪SEM图像序列中的碳纳米管粒子，解决了现有方法只能静态分析或需要手动初始化的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 碳纳米管在纳米技术中至关重要，但其动态生长的表征受到扫描电子显微镜成像中纳米级运动测量实验挑战的限制。现有方法只能提供静态分析，而原位技术通常需要手动初始化且缺乏连续的单粒子轨迹分解。

Method: VFTrack将手工制作或深度特征检测器和匹配器集成到粒子追踪框架中，通过系统评估13,540条手动标注的轨迹，确定ALIKED检测器与LightGlue匹配器为最优组合。

Result: 该方法实现了F1分数0.78和α分数0.89的性能，能够将运动矢量分解为轴向生长、横向漂移和振荡，计算异质区域生长速率并重建演化的CNT柱状形态。

Conclusion: 这项工作推动了自动化纳米材料表征的进步，弥合了基于物理的模型与实验观察之间的差距，实现了碳纳米管合成的实时优化。

Abstract: Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are critical building blocks in nanotechnology, yet
the characterization of their dynamic growth is limited by the experimental
challenges in nanoscale motion measurement using scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) imaging. Existing ex situ methods offer only static analysis, while in
situ techniques often require manual initialization and lack continuous
per-particle trajectory decomposition. We present Visual Feature Tracking
(VFTrack) an in-situ real-time particle tracking framework that automatically
detects and tracks individual CNT particles in SEM image sequences. VFTrack
integrates handcrafted or deep feature detectors and matchers within a particle
tracking framework to enable kinematic analysis of CNT micropillar growth. A
systematic using 13,540 manually annotated trajectories identifies the ALIKED
detector with LightGlue matcher as an optimal combination (F1-score of 0.78,
$\alpha$-score of 0.89). VFTrack motion vectors decomposed into axial growth,
lateral drift, and oscillations, facilitate the calculation of heterogeneous
regional growth rates and the reconstruction of evolving CNT pillar
morphologies. This work enables advancement in automated nano-material
characterization, bridging the gap between physics-based models and
experimental observation to enable real-time optimization of CNT synthesis.

### [71] [Autoregressive Universal Video Segmentation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19242)
*Miran Heo,Sukjun Hwang,Min-Hung Chen,Yu-Chiang Frank Wang,Albert Gu,Seon Joo Kim,Ryo Hachiuma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AUSM是一个统一的视频分割模型，通过序列化掩码预测实现提示和无提示视频分割，基于状态空间模型处理任意长度视频流，训练速度提升2.5倍


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频分割方法在无提示分割场景下碎片化，需要统一架构来处理提示和无提示视频分割任务

Method: 将流式视频分割重新定义为序列掩码预测，构建基于状态空间模型的自回归通用分割模型(AUSM)，保持固定大小空间状态并支持任意长度视频流

Result: 在多个标准基准测试(DAVIS17、YouTube-VOS等)上优于先前方法，16帧序列训练速度提升2.5倍

Conclusion: AUSM成功统一了提示和无提示视频分割，通过序列化掩码预测和状态空间模型实现了高效且通用的视频分割解决方案

Abstract: Recent video foundation models such as SAM2 excel at prompted video
segmentation by treating masks as a general-purpose primitive. However, many
real-world settings require unprompted segmentation that aims to detect and
track all objects in a video without external cues, leaving today's landscape
fragmented across task-specific models and pipelines. We recast streaming video
segmentation as sequential mask prediction, analogous to language modeling, and
introduce the Autoregressive Universal Segmentation Model (AUSM), a single
architecture that unifies both prompted and unprompted video segmentation.
Built on recent state-space models, AUSM maintains a fixed-size spatial state
and scales to video streams of arbitrary length. Furthermore, all components of
AUSM are designed for parallel training across frames, yielding substantial
speedups over iterative training. On standard benchmarks (DAVIS17, YouTube-VOS
2018 & 2019, MOSE, YouTube-VIS 2019 & 2021, and OVIS) AUSM outperforms prior
universal streaming video segmentation methods and achieves up to 2.5x faster
training on 16-frame sequences.

### [72] [Style4D-Bench: A Benchmark Suite for 4D Stylization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19243)
*Beiqi Chen,Shuai Shao,Haitang Feng,Jianhuang Lai,Jianlou Si,Guangcong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Style4D-Bench是首个专门为4D风格化设计的基准套件，包含评估协议、强基线方法和高质量4D场景数据集。提出的Style4D框架基于4D高斯泼溅技术，在时空一致性和多视角渲染方面达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D风格化是一个新兴领域，但缺乏标准化的评估基准和数据集，这阻碍了该领域的研究进展和性能比较。

Method: 提出Style4D框架，包含三个关键组件：基础4DGS场景表示、风格高斯表示（使用轻量级MLP进行外观控制）、以及保持几何完整性的风格转换模块（通过对比一致性学习和结构内容保持）。

Result: 在Style4D-Bench上的广泛实验表明，Style4D在4D风格化方面实现了最先进的性能，能够生成细粒度的风格细节，具有稳定的时间动态和一致的多视角渲染效果。

Conclusion: Style4D-Bench将成为动态3D场景风格化渲染研究的重要资源，有助于标准化评估和推动该领域的发展。

Abstract: We introduce Style4D-Bench, the first benchmark suite specifically designed
for 4D stylization, with the goal of standardizing evaluation and facilitating
progress in this emerging area. Style4D-Bench comprises: 1) a comprehensive
evaluation protocol measuring spatial fidelity, temporal coherence, and
multi-view consistency through both perceptual and quantitative metrics, 2) a
strong baseline that make an initial attempt for 4D stylization, and 3) a
curated collection of high-resolution dynamic 4D scenes with diverse motions
and complex backgrounds. To establish a strong baseline, we present Style4D, a
novel framework built upon 4D Gaussian Splatting. It consists of three key
components: a basic 4DGS scene representation to capture reliable geometry, a
Style Gaussian Representation that leverages lightweight per-Gaussian MLPs for
temporally and spatially aware appearance control, and a Holistic
Geometry-Preserved Style Transfer module designed to enhance spatio-temporal
consistency via contrastive coherence learning and structural content
preservation. Extensive experiments on Style4D-Bench demonstrate that Style4D
achieves state-of-the-art performance in 4D stylization, producing fine-grained
stylistic details with stable temporal dynamics and consistent multi-view
rendering. We expect Style4D-Bench to become a valuable resource for
benchmarking and advancing research in stylized rendering of dynamic 3D scenes.

### [73] [Articulate3D: Zero-Shot Text-Driven 3D Object Posing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19244)
*Oishi Deb,Anjun Hu,Ashkan Khakzar,Philip Torr,Christian Rupprecht*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Articulate3D是一个无需训练的方法，通过语言控制来调整3D资产的姿态。该方法通过图像生成和姿态优化两步实现，使用自注意力重连机制保持结构一致性，并通过关键点对应关系进行优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉和语言模型有所进步，但通过语言控制来调整3D资产姿态仍然是一个具有挑战性的任务。现有方法在保持原始身份的同时实现精确姿态控制方面存在困难。

Method: 1) 修改图像生成器以根据输入图像和文本指令生成目标图像；2) 通过多视角姿态优化将网格与目标图像对齐；3) 引入自注意力重连机制(RSActrl)解耦源结构和姿态；4) 使用关键点建立输入和目标图像之间的对应关系，而不是可微分渲染。

Result: 该方法在多种3D对象和自由形式文本提示上表现有效，成功操纵姿态同时保持网格的原始身份。定量评估和用户研究表明，该方法在85%的情况下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Articulate3D提供了一种有效的训练自由方法，通过语言控制实现3D资产的精确姿态调整，在保持结构一致性和身份完整性方面表现出色。

Abstract: We propose a training-free method, Articulate3D, to pose a 3D asset through
language control. Despite advances in vision and language models, this task
remains surprisingly challenging. To achieve this goal, we decompose the
problem into two steps. We modify a powerful image-generator to create target
images conditioned on the input image and a text instruction. We then align the
mesh to the target images through a multi-view pose optimisation step. In
detail, we introduce a self-attention rewiring mechanism (RSActrl) that
decouples the source structure from pose within an image generative model,
allowing it to maintain a consistent structure across varying poses. We
observed that differentiable rendering is an unreliable signal for articulation
optimisation; instead, we use keypoints to establish correspondences between
input and target images. The effectiveness of Articulate3D is demonstrated
across a diverse range of 3D objects and free-form text prompts, successfully
manipulating poses while maintaining the original identity of the mesh.
Quantitative evaluations and a comparative user study, in which our method was
preferred over 85\% of the time, confirm its superiority over existing
approaches. Project page:https://odeb1.github.io/articulate3d_page_deb/

*Lin Li,Zehuan Huang,Haoran Feng,Gengxiong Zhuang,Rui Chen,Chunchao Guo,Lu Sheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VoxHammer是一种无需训练的3D局部编辑方法，通过在3D潜在空间中保留未编辑区域的反向潜在和键值token，实现精确且连贯的3D编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过编辑多视角图像再重建3D模型，难以精确保持未编辑区域的完整性和整体一致性，需要更精确的3D局部编辑技术。

Method: 首先预测3D模型的反向轨迹获取各时间步的反向潜在和键值token，然后在去噪编辑阶段用这些特征替换保留区域的去噪特征，确保未编辑区域的一致性重建。

Result: 在Edit3D-Bench数据集上的实验表明，VoxHammer在保留区域的3D一致性和整体质量方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为合成高质量编辑配对数据提供了有效解决方案，为上下文3D生成奠定了数据基础。

Abstract: 3D local editing of specified regions is crucial for game industry and robot
interaction. Recent methods typically edit rendered multi-view images and then
reconstruct 3D models, but they face challenges in precisely preserving
unedited regions and overall coherence. Inspired by structured 3D generative
models, we propose VoxHammer, a novel training-free approach that performs
precise and coherent editing in 3D latent space. Given a 3D model, VoxHammer
first predicts its inversion trajectory and obtains its inverted latents and
key-value tokens at each timestep. Subsequently, in the denoising and editing
phase, we replace the denoising features of preserved regions with the
corresponding inverted latents and cached key-value tokens. By retaining these
contextual features, this approach ensures consistent reconstruction of
preserved areas and coherent integration of edited parts. To evaluate the
consistency of preserved regions, we constructed Edit3D-Bench, a
human-annotated dataset comprising hundreds of samples, each with carefully
labeled 3D editing regions. Experiments demonstrate that VoxHammer
significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both 3D consistency of
preserved regions and overall quality. Our method holds promise for
synthesizing high-quality edited paired data, thereby laying the data
foundation for in-context 3D generation. See our project page at

### [75] [Federative ischemic stroke segmentation as alternative to overcome domain-shift multi-institution challenges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18296)
*Edgar Rangel,Fabio Martinez*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种协作式框架，通过分布式深度学习技术实现了在多个医疗中心之间共享知识，从而提高了置血性脑梗止症理的分割准确性和通用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的脑梗止症分割方法存在两大问题：一是仅从单一机构学习，缺乏对不同病人群体和扫描仪器的通用性；二是许多医疗中心缺乏足够的标签数据来调整专门模型。

Method: 研究者开发了一种协作框架，通过分布式深度学习技术（如FedAvg模型）从14个模拟医疗中心的2031个研究中共享知识，构建中心独立的深度表征表示。

Result: 结果显示FedAvg模型在所有中心都取得了最佳表现：DSC为0.71±0.24，AVD为5.29±22.74，ALD为2.16±3.60，LF1为0.70±0.26，超越了集中式和其他联邦学习方法。模型还显示了强大的通用性，在分布外中心也能获得0.64±0.29的DSC成绩。

Conclusion: 这种协作式框架能够有效解决医疗数据安全和隐私保护的同时，通过分布式学习技术实现多中心知识共享，为置血性脑梗止症的准确分割提供了可靠的解决方案，具有重要的临床应用价值。

Abstract: Stroke is the second leading cause of death and the third leading cause of
disability worldwide. Clinical guidelines establish diffusion resonance imaging
(DWI, ADC) as the standard for localizing, characterizing, and measuring
infarct volume, enabling treatment support and prognosis. Nonetheless, such
lesion analysis is highly variable due to different patient demographics,
scanner vendors, and expert annotations. Computational support approaches have
been key to helping with the localization and segmentation of lesions. However,
these strategies are dedicated solutions that learn patterns from only one
institution, lacking the variability to generalize geometrical lesions shape
models. Even worse, many clinical centers lack sufficient labeled samples to
adjust these dedicated solutions. This work developed a collaborative framework
for segmenting ischemic stroke lesions in DWI sequences by sharing knowledge
from deep center-independent representations. From 14 emulated healthcare
centers with 2031 studies, the FedAvg model achieved a general DSC of $0.71 \pm
0.24$, AVD of $5.29 \pm 22.74$, ALD of $2.16 \pm 3.60$ and LF1 of $0.70 \pm
0.26$ over all centers, outperforming both the centralized and other federated
rules. Interestingly, the model demonstrated strong generalization properties,
showing uniform performance across different lesion categories and reliable
performance in out-of-distribution centers (with DSC of $0.64 \pm 0.29$ and AVD
of $4.44 \pm 8.74$ without any additional training).

### [76] [Stress-testing cross-cancer generalizability of 3D nnU-Net for PET-CT tumor segmentation: multi-cohort evaluation with novel oesophageal and lung cancer datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18612)
*Soumen Ghosh,Christine Jestin Hannan,Rajat Vashistha,Parveen Kundu,Sandra Brosda,Lauren G. Aoude,James Lonie,Andrew Nathanson,Jessica Ng,Andrew P. Barbour,Viktor Vegh*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 本研究首次在PET-CT上对nnU-Net进行跨癌症评估，使用两个新的专家标注全身数据集（279例食管癌和54例肺癌），发现数据集多样性（多人口统计、多中心、多癌症整合）比架构创新更能驱动鲁棒泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在临床PET-CT工作流中，由于解剖部位、扫描仪和患者群体的广泛变化，深度学习肿瘤分割需要具备鲁棒泛化能力。

Method: 使用3D nnUNet模型在三种训练范式下进行训练和测试：仅目标数据集（食管癌）、仅公共数据集（AutoPET）以及组合训练。使用两个新的专家标注全身数据集进行跨域性能系统压力测试。

Result: 组合训练方法在所有队列中提供了最平衡的结果（平均DSC：肺癌52.9，食管癌40.7，AutoPET 60.9），减少了边界错误并提高了鲁棒性。仅目标模型在域内准确率最高但外部泛化失败，仅公共模型泛化更广但在特定队列表现不佳。

Conclusion: 数据集多样性，特别是多人口统计、多中心和多癌症整合，是临床鲁棒分割的基础，其重要性超过了模型复杂性。

Abstract: Robust generalization is essential for deploying deep learning based tumor
segmentation in clinical PET-CT workflows, where anatomical sites, scanners,
and patient populations vary widely. This study presents the first cross cancer
evaluation of nnU-Net on PET-CT, introducing two novel, expert-annotated
whole-body datasets. 279 patients with oesophageal cancer (Australian cohort)
and 54 with lung cancer (Indian cohort). These cohorts complement the public
AutoPET dataset and enable systematic stress-testing of cross domain
performance. We trained and tested 3D nnUNet models under three paradigms.
Target only (oesophageal), public only (AutoPET), and combined training. For
the tested sets, the oesophageal only model achieved the best in-domain
accuracy (mean DSC, 57.8) but failed on external Indian lung cohort (mean DSC
less than 3.4), indicating severe overfitting. The public only model
generalized more broadly (mean DSC, 63.5 on AutoPET, 51.6 on Indian lung
cohort) but underperformed in oesophageal Australian cohort (mean DSC, 26.7).
The combined approach provided the most balanced results (mean DSC, lung
(52.9), oesophageal (40.7), AutoPET (60.9)), reducing boundary errors and
improving robustness across all cohorts. These findings demonstrate that
dataset diversity, particularly multi demographic, multi center and multi
cancer integration, outweighs architectural novelty as the key driver of robust
generalization. This work presents the demography based cross cancer deep
learning segmentation evaluation and highlights dataset diversity, rather than
model complexity, as the foundation for clinically robust segmentation.

*Eichi Takaya,Ryusei Inamori*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: ModAn-MulSupCon是一种利用医学图像模态和解剖区域元数据的多标签监督对比预训练方法，在微调场景下优于传统预训练方法，特别适用于标签稀缺的临床环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像的大规模监督预训练受限于专家标注成本，而模态和解剖区域等元数据普遍可用但未充分利用。研究旨在利用这些元数据学习可迁移的表征。

Method: 将每张图像的模态和解剖信息编码为多热向量，使用ResNet-18在miniRIN数据集(16,222张图像)上通过Jaccard加权的多标签监督对比损失进行预训练，然后在三个二分类任务上评估微调和线性探测性能。

Result: 微调时，ModAn-MulSupCon在MRNet-ACL(0.964 AUC)和甲状腺(0.763 AUC)任务上表现最佳，在乳腺任务(0.926 AUC)排名第二。冻结编码器时SimCLR/ImageNet更优，表明该方法表征更适合任务适应而非线性可分性。

Conclusion: 利用模态/解剖元数据作为多标签目标提供了实用、可扩展的预训练信号，在可微调场景下能提升下游任务准确率，是标签稀缺临床环境的强初始化方法，而冻结编码器部署时SimCLR/ImageNet更优。

Abstract: Background and objective: Expert annotations limit large-scale supervised
pretraining in medical imaging, while ubiquitous metadata (modality, anatomical
region) remain underused. We introduce ModAn-MulSupCon, a modality- and
anatomy-aware multi-label supervised contrastive pretraining method that
leverages such metadata to learn transferable representations.
  Method: Each image's modality and anatomy are encoded as a multi-hot vector.
A ResNet-18 encoder is pretrained on a mini subset of RadImageNet (miniRIN,
16,222 images) with a Jaccard-weighted multi-label supervised contrastive loss,
and then evaluated by fine-tuning and linear probing on three binary
classification tasks--ACL tear (knee MRI), lesion malignancy (breast
ultrasound), and nodule malignancy (thyroid ultrasound).
  Result: With fine-tuning, ModAn-MulSupCon achieved the best AUC on MRNet-ACL
(0.964) and Thyroid (0.763), surpassing all baselines ($p<0.05$), and ranked
second on Breast (0.926) behind SimCLR (0.940; not significant). With the
encoder frozen, SimCLR/ImageNet were superior, indicating that ModAn-MulSupCon
representations benefit most from task adaptation rather than linear
separability.
  Conclusion: Encoding readily available modality/anatomy metadata as
multi-label targets provides a practical, scalable pretraining signal that
improves downstream accuracy when fine-tuning is feasible. ModAn-MulSupCon is a
strong initialization for label-scarce clinical settings, whereas
SimCLR/ImageNet remain preferable for frozen-encoder deployments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原始软上下文形成编码器只支持RGB 4:4:4格式，无法处理视频压缩中常用的YCbCr 4:2:0格式，需要扩展其功能

Method: 基于图像平面间归一化互信息分析，依次编码Y和CbCr平面；增强基于亮度平面的色度预测；传输亮度-色度组合的边信息以改进概率分布建模

Result: 在大规模屏幕内容图像数据集上平均表现优于HEVC-SCC，HEVC-SCC需要多5.66%的码率

Conclusion: 成功扩展了软上下文形成编码器对4:2:0格式的支持，通过改进的色度预测和概率建模实现了更好的压缩性能

Abstract: The soft context formation coder is a pixel-wise state-of-the-art lossless
screen content coder using pattern matching and color palette coding in
combination with arithmetic coding. It achieves excellent compression
performance on screen content images in RGB 4:4:4 format with few distinct
colors. In contrast to many other lossless compression methods, it codes entire
color pixels at once, i.e., all color components of one pixel are coded
together. Consequently, it does not natively support image formats with
downsampled chroma, such as YCbCr 4:2:0, which is an often used chroma format
in video compression. In this paper, we extend the soft context formation
coding capabilities to 4:2:0 image compression, by successively coding Y and
CbCr planes based on an analysis of normalized mutual information between image
planes. Additionally, we propose an enhancement to the chroma prediction based
on the luminance plane. Furthermore, we propose to transmit side-information
about occurring luma-chroma combinations to improve chroma probability
distribution modelling. Averaged over a large screen content image dataset, our
proposed method outperforms HEVC-SCC, with HEVC-SCC needing 5.66% more bitrate
compared to our method.

Method: 使用Swin Transformer编码器（通过SimMIM在10,432个未标记3D CT扫描上预训练）和卷积解码器，结合随机森林分类器利用深度特征检测OOD扫描

Result: 在603个3D CT测试集上，RF-Deep在肺栓塞、COVID-19和腹部CT上的FPR95分别为18.26%、27.66%和小于0.1%，优于现有OOD检测方法

Conclusion: RF-Deep提供了一种简单有效的方法来增强癌症分割在分布内和分布外场景中的可靠性

Abstract: Accurate detection and segmentation of cancerous lesions from computed
tomography (CT) scans is essential for automated treatment planning and cancer
treatment response assessment. Transformer-based models with self-supervised
pretraining can produce reliably accurate segmentation from in-distribution
(ID) data but degrade when applied to out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. We
address this challenge with RF-Deep, a random forest classifier that utilizes
deep features from a pretrained transformer encoder of the segmentation model
to detect OOD scans and enhance segmentation reliability. The segmentation
model comprises a Swin Transformer encoder, pretrained with masked image
modeling (SimMIM) on 10,432 unlabeled 3D CT scans covering cancerous and
non-cancerous conditions, with a convolution decoder, trained to segment lung
cancers in 317 3D scans. Independent testing was performed on 603 3D CT public
datasets that included one ID dataset and four OOD datasets comprising chest
CTs with pulmonary embolism (PE) and COVID-19, and abdominal CTs with kidney
cancers and healthy volunteers. RF-Deep detected OOD cases with a FPR95 of
18.26%, 27.66%, and less than 0.1% on PE, COVID-19, and abdominal CTs,
consistently outperforming established OOD approaches. The RF-Deep classifier
provides a simple and effective approach to enhance reliability of cancer
segmentation in ID and OOD scenarios.

Abstract: The development of artificial intelligence models for macular edema (ME)
analy-sis always relies on expert-annotated pixel-level image datasets which
are expen-sive to collect prospectively. While anomaly-detection-based
weakly-supervised methods have shown promise in edema area (EA) segmentation
task, their per-formance still lags behind fully-supervised approaches. In this
paper, we leverage the strong correlation between EA and retinal layers in
spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) images, along with the
update characteristics of weakly-supervised learning, to enhance an
off-the-shelf adversarial framework for EA segmentation with a novel
layer-structure-guided post-processing step and a test-time-adaptation (TTA)
strategy. By incorporating additional retinal lay-er information, our framework
reframes the dense EA prediction task as one of confirming intersection points
between the EA contour and retinal layers, result-ing in predictions that
better align with the shape prior of EA. Besides, the TTA framework further
helps address discrepancies in the manifestations and presen-tations of EA
between training and test sets. Extensive experiments on two pub-licly
available datasets demonstrate that these two proposed ingredients can im-prove
the accuracy and robustness of EA segmentation, bridging the gap between
weakly-supervised and fully-supervised models.

Abstract: MR imaging is a valuable diagnostic tool allowing to non-invasively visualize
patient anatomy and pathology with high soft-tissue contrast. However, MRI
acquisition is typically time-consuming, leading to patient discomfort and
increased costs to the healthcare system. Recent years have seen substantial
research effort into the development of methods that allow for accelerated MRI
acquisition while still obtaining a reconstruction that appears similar to the
fully-sampled MR image. However, for many applications a perfectly
reconstructed MR image may not be necessary, particularly, when the primary
goal is a downstream task such as segmentation. This has led to growing
interest in methods that aim to perform segmentation directly on accelerated
MRI data. Despite recent advances, existing methods have largely been developed
in isolation, without direct comparison to one another, often using separate or
private datasets, and lacking unified evaluation standards. To date, no
high-quality, comprehensive comparison of these methods exists, and the optimal
strategy for segmenting accelerated MR data remains unknown. This paper
provides the first unified benchmark for the segmentation of undersampled MRI
data comparing 7 approaches. A particular focus is placed on comparing
\textit{one-stage approaches}, that combine reconstruction and segmentation
into a unified model, with \textit{two-stage approaches}, that utilize
established MRI reconstruction methods followed by a segmentation network. We
test these methods on two MRI datasets that include multi-coil k-space data as
well as a human-annotated segmentation ground-truth. We find that simple
two-stage methods that consider data-consistency lead to the best segmentation
scores, surpassing complex specialized methods that are developed specifically
for this task.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: RDDM是一种直接在RAW域进行图像恢复的端到端扩散模型，通过绕过传统的ISP+IR两阶段处理，在RAW域直接生成高保真图像，解决了sRGB域方法在保真度和真实感之间的困境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的sRGB域扩散模型处理有损的sRGB输入，忽视了传感器RAW图像在许多场景（如边缘设备图像采集）中的可访问性，导致性能不佳。RAW域处理可以避免这个问题。

Method: 提出RAW域VAE（RVAE）学习最优潜在表示，可微分后色调处理（PTP）模块实现RAW和sRGB空间联合优化，开发可扩展的退化管道从现有sRGB数据集合成RAW LQ-HQ对，设计可配置多拜耳（CMB）LoRA模块处理不同RAW模式。

Result: 大量实验证明RDDM优于最先进的sRGB扩散方法，能够以更少的伪影产生更高保真度的结果。

Conclusion: RDDM通过直接在RAW域进行图像恢复，有效解决了传统方法在保真度和真实感之间的权衡问题，为边缘设备等场景提供了更优的图像恢复解决方案。

Abstract: We present the RAW domain diffusion model (RDDM), an end-to-end diffusion
model that restores photo-realistic images directly from the sensor RAW data.
While recent sRGB-domain diffusion methods achieve impressive results, they are
caught in a dilemma between high fidelity and realistic generation. As these
models process lossy sRGB inputs and neglect the accessibility of the sensor
RAW images in many scenarios, e.g., in image and video capturing in edge
devices, resulting in sub-optimal performance. RDDM bypasses this limitation by
directly restoring images in the RAW domain, replacing the conventional
two-stage image signal processing (ISP) + IR pipeline. However, a simple
adaptation of pre-trained diffusion models to the RAW domain confronts the
out-of-distribution (OOD) issues. To this end, we propose: (1) a RAW-domain VAE
(RVAE) learning optimal latent representations, (2) a differentiable Post Tone
Processing (PTP) module enabling joint RAW and sRGB space optimization. To
compensate for the deficiency in the dataset, we develop a scalable degradation
pipeline synthesizing RAW LQ-HQ pairs from existing sRGB datasets for
large-scale training. Furthermore, we devise a configurable multi-bayer (CMB)
LoRA module handling diverse RAW patterns such as RGGB, BGGR, etc. Extensive
experiments demonstrate RDDM's superiority over state-of-the-art sRGB diffusion
methods, yielding higher fidelity results with fewer artifacts.

Abstract: Training a generative model on a single human skeletal motion sequence
without being bound to a specific kinematic tree has drawn significant
attention from the animation community. Unlike text-to-motion generation,
single-shot models allow animators to controllably generate variations of
existing motion patterns without requiring additional data or extensive
retraining. However, existing single-shot methods do not explicitly offer a
controllable framework for blending two or more motions within a single
generative pass. In this paper, we present the first single-shot motion
blending framework that enables seamless blending by temporally conditioning
the generation process. Our method introduces a skeleton-aware normalization
mechanism to guide the transition between motions, allowing smooth, data-driven
control over when and how motions blend. We perform extensive quantitative and
qualitative evaluations across various animation styles and different kinematic
skeletons, demonstrating that our approach produces plausible, smooth, and
controllable motion blends in a unified and efficient manner.

Abstract: Radiance fields have revolutionized photo-realistic 3D scene visualization by
enabling high-fidelity reconstruction of complex environments, making them an
ideal match for light field displays. However, integrating these technologies
presents significant computational challenges, as light field displays require
multiple high-resolution renderings from slightly shifted viewpoints, while
radiance fields rely on computationally intensive volume rendering. In this
paper, we propose a unified and efficient framework for real-time radiance
field rendering on light field displays. Our method supports a wide range of
radiance field representations, including NeRFs, 3D Gaussian Splatting, and
Sparse Voxels, within a shared architecture based on a single-pass plane
sweeping strategy and caching of shared, non-directional components. The
framework generalizes across different scene formats without retraining, and
avoids redundant computation across views. We further demonstrate a real-time
interactive application on a Looking Glass display, achieving 200+ FPS at 512p
across 45 views, enabling seamless, immersive 3D interaction. On standard
benchmarks, our method achieves up to 22x speedup compared to independently
rendering each view, while preserving image quality.

Result: 在3D-FRONT数据集上的实验表明，该方法能生成空间连贯、真实且多样化的场景，优于先前方法。

Conclusion: SemLayoutDiff通过显式考虑建筑约束条件，实现了更实用和连贯的3D室内场景合成，为多房间类型的场景生成提供了统一解决方案。

Abstract: We present SemLayoutDiff, a unified model for synthesizing diverse 3D indoor
scenes across multiple room types. The model introduces a scene layout
representation combining a top-down semantic map and attributes for each
object. Unlike prior approaches, which cannot condition on architectural
constraints, SemLayoutDiff employs a categorical diffusion model capable of
conditioning scene synthesis explicitly on room masks. It first generates a
coherent semantic map, followed by a cross-attention-based network to predict
furniture placements that respect the synthesized layout. Our method also
accounts for architectural elements such as doors and windows, ensuring that
generated furniture arrangements remain practical and unobstructed. Experiments
on the 3D-FRONT dataset show that SemLayoutDiff produces spatially coherent,
realistic, and varied scenes, outperforming previous methods.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个简化的替代方案，避免了复杂的多视角数据采集设置，能够快速生成视觉上吸引人的头发发丝，在头发合成领域具有重要改进意义。

Abstract: Achieving realistic hair strand synthesis is essential for creating lifelike
digital humans, but producing high-fidelity hair strand geometry remains a
significant challenge. Existing methods require a complex setup for data
acquisition, involving multi-view images captured in constrained studio
environments. Additionally, these methods have longer hair volume estimation
and strand synthesis times, which hinder efficiency. We introduce PanoHair, a
model that estimates head geometry as signed distance fields using knowledge
distillation from a pre-trained generative teacher model for head synthesis.
Our approach enables the prediction of semantic segmentation masks and 3D
orientations specifically for the hair region of the estimated geometry. Our
method is generative and can generate diverse hairstyles with latent space
manipulations. For real images, our approach involves an inversion process to
infer latent codes and produces visually appealing hair strands, offering a
streamlined alternative to complex multi-view data acquisition setups. Given
the latent code, PanoHair generates a clean manifold mesh for the hair region
in under 5 seconds, along with semantic and orientation maps, marking a
significant improvement over existing methods, as demonstrated in our
experiments.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Point Cloud (INPC) is a recent hybrid representation that
combines the expressiveness of neural fields with the efficiency of point-based
rendering, achieving state-of-the-art image quality in novel view synthesis.
However, as with other high-quality approaches that query neural networks
during rendering, the practical usability of INPC is limited by comparatively
slow rendering. In this work, we present a collection of optimizations that
significantly improve both the training and inference performance of INPC
without sacrificing visual fidelity. The most significant modifications are an
improved rasterizer implementation, more effective sampling techniques, and the
incorporation of pre-training for the convolutional neural network used for
hole-filling. Furthermore, we demonstrate that points can be modeled as small
Gaussians during inference to further improve quality in extrapolated, e.g.,
close-up views of the scene. We design our implementations to be broadly
applicable beyond INPC and systematically evaluate each modification in a
series of experiments. Our optimized INPC pipeline achieves up to 25% faster
training, 2x faster rendering, and 20% reduced VRAM usage paired with slight
image quality improvements.

Abstract: The trade-off between image resolution and model field-of-view has long been
a limitation for numerical simulations in digital rock models. A significant
amount of sub-resolution pore space cannot be captured in the unresolved
digital rock images, which hinders the accuracy of numerical simulations,
especially those predicting the rock effective elastic properties. This work
uses paired digital rock images at multiple resolutions to investigate the
sub-resolution solid and pore fraction distributions. It demonstrates that the
cumulative Beta distribution function can effectively represent the solid and
pore fractions in unresolved rock images. Based on this finding, we propose a
novel methodology to predict the sub-resolution pore fractions. Compared to the
pore fractions extracted from paired Bentheimer sandstone images at resolutions
of 2, 6, and 18um, the proposed method yields double-weighted mean absolute
percentage errors (WWMAPE) of 3.67% (6um) and 13.78% (18um), significantly
lower than the SLOT technique's errors of 24.55% (6um) and 59.33% (18um). By
incorporating the modelled solid and pore fractions with effective medium
theory, this work achieves improved predictions of effective elastic moduli and
wave velocities across various rock types. This method has significant
implications for conducting enhanced simulations of geophysical properties in
unresolved rock models.

Conclusion: 3D边缘衍射具有独特性质，通过混合走时导数方法和三重平方根时差公式可以更好地处理和利用边缘衍射信息，为地下异常体探测提供新的技术手段。

Abstract: Various underground anomalies, both natural and artificial, cause diffraction
of high-frequency seismic and electromagnetic pulses emitted from the earth's
surface. Backscattered, they are registered by seismic sensors and
ground-penetrating radars. Most of these signals can be categorized as either
point or edge diffraction. Despite the abundance of linear structures in
geological formations and among buried anthropogenic objects, diffraction
processing often relies on the idea of point diffraction. However, 3-D edge
diffractions have unique properties that need to be exploited. We show that the
mixed source-receiver traveltime derivatives, available from data, identify
edge diffractions at arbitrary offsets. Additionally, they constitute a system
of ordinary differential equations describing finite-offset focusing curves on
the acquisition surface. Such curves enable sorting of the data into fragments
that focus on specific points on the edge. To confirm and demonstrate these
properties, we derive an exact traveltime formula for a straight diffractor in
a homogeneous medium. We refer to it as the triple-square-root moveout in
analogy to the double-square-root moveout of 2-D diffractions. Since it
represents a potentially useful approximation, we compare it with standard
moveouts and wave modeling.

Result: 在图像生成任务中验证了方法的有效性，相比等权重方法能更好地满足约束条件

Conclusion: 该框架为扩散模型的对齐和组合提供了理论保证和实用解决方案，能有效处理多奖励优化中的权衡问题

Abstract: Diffusion models have become prevalent in generative modeling due to their
ability to sample from complex distributions. To improve the quality of
generated samples and their compliance with user requirements, two commonly
used methods are: (i) Alignment, which involves fine-tuning a diffusion model
to align it with a reward; and (ii) Composition, which combines several
pre-trained diffusion models, each emphasizing a desirable attribute in the
generated outputs. However, trade-offs often arise when optimizing for multiple
rewards or combining multiple models, as they can often represent competing
properties. Existing methods cannot guarantee that the resulting model
faithfully generates samples with all the desired properties. To address this
gap, we propose a constrained optimization framework that unifies alignment and
composition of diffusion models by enforcing that the aligned model satisfies
reward constraints and/or remains close to (potentially multiple) pre-trained
models. We provide a theoretical characterization of the solutions to the
constrained alignment and composition problems and develop a Lagrangian-based
primal-dual training algorithm to approximate these solutions. Empirically, we
demonstrate the effectiveness and merits of our proposed approach in image
generation, applying it to alignment and composition, and show that our aligned
or composed model satisfies constraints effectively, and improves on the
equally-weighted approach. Our implementation can be found at

Motivation: 解决时间序列数据中训练和测试数据集之间分布偏移的常见挑战，提高模型在未标记测试数据上的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Method: 采用多尺度混合输入架构捕获不同尺度特征，增加训练多样性并减少域间特征差异；基于证据学习引入不确定性感知机制，通过对标签施加Dirichlet先验来实现目标预测和不确定性估计。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上达到最先进性能，显著提升目标域性能，并大幅降低预期校准误差(ECE)，表明预测置信度校准更好。

Conclusion: 多尺度混合输入架构与不确定性感知机制的结合方法在时间序列无监督域自适应中非常有效，能够显著改善跨域泛化能力和预测可靠性。

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation methods seek to generalize effectively on
unlabeled test data, especially when encountering the common challenge in time
series data that distribution shifts occur between training and testing
datasets. In this paper, we propose incorporating multi-scale feature
extraction and uncertainty estimation to improve the model's generalization and
robustness across domains. Our approach begins with a multi-scale mixed input
architecture that captures features at different scales, increasing training
diversity and reducing feature discrepancies between the training and testing
domains. Based on the mixed input architecture, we further introduce an
uncertainty awareness mechanism based on evidential learning by imposing a
Dirichlet prior on the labels to facilitate both target prediction and
uncertainty estimation. The uncertainty awareness mechanism enhances domain
adaptation by aligning features with the same labels across different domains,
which leads to significant performance improvements in the target domain.
Additionally, our uncertainty-aware model demonstrates a much lower Expected
Calibration Error (ECE), indicating better-calibrated prediction confidence.
Our experimental results show that this combined approach of mixed input
architecture with the uncertainty awareness mechanism achieves state-of-the-art
performance across multiple benchmark datasets, underscoring its effectiveness
in unsupervised domain adaptation for time series data.

Result: 在ImageNet-10上达到98.7%准确率，ImageNet-100上82.7%准确率，实现40倍参数压缩，计算速度比二分法快6倍

Conclusion: 拓扑引导的图设计能够产生高效的物理启发嵌入，在极大压缩下仍保持最先进性能，证明了物理、编码和拓扑结合的强大潜力

Abstract: We present a unified framework combining statistical physics, coding theory,
and algebraic topology for efficient multi-class image classification.
High-dimensional feature vectors from a frozen MobileNetV2 backbone are
interpreted as spins on a sparse Multi-Edge Type quasi-cyclic LDPC
(MET-QC-LDPC) graph, forming a Random-Bond Ising Model (RBIM). We operate this
RBIM at its Nishimori temperature, $\beta_N$, where the smallest eigenvalue of
the Bethe-Hessian matrix vanishes, maximizing class separability.
  Our theoretical contribution establishes a correspondence between local
trapping sets in the code's graph and topological invariants (Betti numbers,
bordism classes) of the feature manifold. A practical algorithm estimates
$\beta_N$ efficiently with a quadratic interpolant and Newton correction,
achieving a six-fold speed-up over bisection.
  Guided by topology, we design spherical and toroidal MET-QC-LDPC graph
ensembles, using permanent bounds to suppress harmful trapping sets. This
compresses 1280-dimensional features to 32 or 64 dimensions for ImageNet-10 and
-100 subsets. Despite massive compression (40x fewer parameters), we achieve
98.7% accuracy on ImageNet-10 and 82.7% on ImageNet-100, demonstrating that
topology-guided graph design yields highly efficient, physics-inspired
embeddings with state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that Machine Learning (ML) models can exhibit bias
in real-world scenarios, posing significant challenges in ethically sensitive
domains such as healthcare. Such bias can negatively affect model fairness,
model generalization abilities and further risks amplifying social
discrimination. There is a need to remove biases from trained models. Existing
debiasing approaches often necessitate access to original training data and
need extensive model retraining; they also typically exhibit trade-offs between
model fairness and discriminative performance. To address these challenges, we
propose Soft-Mask Weight Fine-Tuning (SWiFT), a debiasing framework that
efficiently improves fairness while preserving discriminative performance with
much less debiasing costs. Notably, SWiFT requires only a small external
dataset and only a few epochs of model fine-tuning. The idea behind SWiFT is to
first find the relative, and yet distinct, contributions of model parameters to
both bias and predictive performance. Then, a two-step fine-tuning process
updates each parameter with different gradient flows defined by its
contribution. Extensive experiments with three bias sensitive attributes
(gender, skin tone, and age) across four dermatological and two chest X-ray
datasets demonstrate that SWiFT can consistently reduce model bias while
achieving competitive or even superior diagnostic accuracy under common
fairness and accuracy metrics, compared to the state-of-the-art. Specifically,
we demonstrate improved model generalization ability as evidenced by superior
performance on several out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets.

Abstract: Balancing sensitivity to new tasks and stability for retaining past knowledge
is crucial in continual learning (CL). Recently, sharpness-aware minimization
has proven effective in transfer learning and has also been adopted in
continual learning (CL) to improve memory retention and learning efficiency.
However, relying on zeroth-order sharpness alone may favor sharper minima over
flatter ones in certain settings, leading to less robust and potentially
suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we propose \textbf{C}ontinual
\textbf{Flat}ness (\textbf{C-Flat}), a method that promotes flatter loss
landscapes tailored for CL. C-Flat offers plug-and-play compatibility, enabling
easy integration with minimal modifications to the code pipeline. Besides, we
present a general framework that integrates C-Flat into all major CL paradigms
and conduct comprehensive comparisons with loss-minima optimizers and
flat-minima-based CL methods. Our results show that C-Flat consistently
improves performance across a wide range of settings. In addition, we introduce
C-Flat++, an efficient yet effective framework that leverages selective
flatness-driven promotion, significantly reducing the update cost required by
C-Flat. Extensive experiments across multiple CL methods, datasets, and
scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed
approaches. Code is available at https://github.com/WanNaa/C-Flat.

Abstract: Deep understanding of electromagnetic signals is fundamental to dynamic
spectrum management, intelligent transportation, autonomous driving and
unmanned vehicle perception. The field faces challenges because electromagnetic
signals differ greatly from text and images, showing high heterogeneity, strong
background noise and complex joint time frequency structure, which prevents
existing general models from direct use. Electromagnetic communication and
sensing tasks are diverse, current methods lack cross task generalization and
transfer efficiency, and the scarcity of large high quality datasets blocks the
creation of a truly general multitask learning framework. To overcome these
issue, we introduce EMind, an electromagnetic signals foundation model that
bridges large scale pretraining and the unique nature of this modality. We
build the first unified and largest standardized electromagnetic signal dataset
covering multiple signal types and tasks. By exploiting the physical properties
of electromagnetic signals, we devise a length adaptive multi-signal packing
method and a hardware-aware training strategy that enable efficient use and
representation learning from heterogeneous multi-source signals. Experiments
show that EMind achieves strong performance and broad generalization across
many downstream tasks, moving decisively from task specific models to a unified
framework for electromagnetic intelligence. The code is available at:

Result: 在ARMBench数据集上F1分数从77.9提升到80.0，测试时增强后达到81.4

Conclusion: 时空信息对失败检测至关重要，需要进一步研究合适的启发式方法

Abstract: Robust robotic task execution hinges on the reliable detection of execution
failures in order to trigger safe operation modes, recovery strategies, or task
replanning. However, many failure detection methods struggle to provide
meaningful performance when applied to a variety of real-world scenarios. In
this paper, we propose a video-based failure detection approach that uses
spatio-temporal knowledge in the form of the actions the robot performs and
task-relevant objects within the field of view. Both pieces of information are
available in most robotic scenarios and can thus be readily obtained. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on three datasets that we amend,
in part, with additional annotations of the aforementioned task-relevant
knowledge. In light of the results, we also propose a data augmentation method
that improves performance by applying variable frame rates to different parts
of the video. We observe an improvement from 77.9 to 80.0 in F1 score on the
ARMBench dataset without additional computational expense and an additional
increase to 81.4 with test-time augmentation. The results emphasize the
importance of spatio-temporal information during failure detection and suggest
further investigation of suitable heuristics in future implementations. Code
and annotations are available.

Conclusion: TIG算法是一种高效、实时的无人机路径规划方法，在静态和动态环境中都表现出优越的性能，能够生成平滑且计算效率高的飞行路径。

Abstract: Efficient and safe navigation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is critical
for various applications, including combat support, package delivery and Search
and Rescue Operations. This paper introduces the Tangent Intersection Guidance
(TIG) algorithm, an advanced approach for UAV path planning in both static and
dynamic environments. The algorithm uses the elliptic tangent intersection
method to generate feasible paths. It generates two sub-paths for each threat,
selects the optimal route based on a heuristic rule, and iteratively refines
the path until the target is reached. Considering the UAV kinematic and dynamic
constraints, a modified smoothing technique based on quadratic B\'ezier curves
is adopted to generate a smooth and efficient route. Experimental results show
that the TIG algorithm can generate the shortest path in less time, starting
from 0.01 seconds, with fewer turning angles compared to A*, PRM, RRT*, Tangent
Graph, and Static APPATT algorithms in static environments. Furthermore, in
completely unknown and partially known environments, TIG demonstrates efficient
real-time path planning capabilities for collision avoidance, outperforming APF
and Dynamic APPATT algorithms.

Conclusion: MemoryVLA通过模拟人类记忆机制有效处理机器人操作中的时序上下文，在长时程任务中展现出显著优势，为时序感知的机器人操作提供了新思路

Abstract: Temporal context is essential for robotic manipulation because such tasks are
inherently non-Markovian, yet mainstream VLA models typically overlook it and
struggle with long-horizon, temporally dependent tasks. Cognitive science
suggests that humans rely on working memory to buffer short-lived
representations for immediate control, while the hippocampal system preserves
verbatim episodic details and semantic gist of past experience for long-term
memory. Inspired by these mechanisms, we propose MemoryVLA, a
Cognition-Memory-Action framework for long-horizon robotic manipulation. A
pretrained VLM encodes the observation into perceptual and cognitive tokens
that form working memory, while a Perceptual-Cognitive Memory Bank stores
low-level details and high-level semantics consolidated from it. Working memory
retrieves decision-relevant entries from the bank, adaptively fuses them with
current tokens, and updates the bank by merging redundancies. Using these
tokens, a memory-conditioned diffusion action expert yields temporally aware
action sequences. We evaluate MemoryVLA on 150+ simulation and real-world tasks
across three robots. On SimplerEnv-Bridge, Fractal, and LIBERO-5 suites, it
achieves 71.9%, 72.7%, and 96.5% success rates, respectively, all outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines CogACT and pi-0, with a notable +14.6 gain on
Bridge. On 12 real-world tasks spanning general skills and long-horizon
temporal dependencies, MemoryVLA achieves 84.0% success rate, with long-horizon
tasks showing a +26 improvement over state-of-the-art baseline. Project Page:

TL;DR: Hidden Tail是一种针对视觉语言模型的隐蔽资源消耗攻击，通过生成对抗图像诱导模型输出不可见的特殊标记来最大化推理成本，同时保持攻击的隐蔽性。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型资源消耗攻击在延长输出序列时会产生不相关的异常内容，破坏了攻击的隐蔽性，需要在有效性和隐蔽性之间进行权衡。

Method: 使用复合损失函数平衡语义保持、重复特殊标记诱导和抑制序列结束标记，通过动态权重策略进行优化，生成与提示无关的对抗图像。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了视觉语言模型在面对效率导向对抗威胁时的脆弱性，迫切需要提高其鲁棒性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, but their high inference cost makes them vulnerable to resource
consumption attacks. Prior attacks attempt to extend VLM output sequences by
optimizing adversarial images, thereby increasing inference costs. However,
these extended outputs often introduce irrelevant abnormal content,
compromising attack stealthiness. This trade-off between effectiveness and
stealthiness poses a major limitation for existing attacks. To address this
challenge, we propose \textit{Hidden Tail}, a stealthy resource consumption
attack that crafts prompt-agnostic adversarial images, inducing VLMs to
generate maximum-length outputs by appending special tokens invisible to users.
Our method employs a composite loss function that balances semantic
preservation, repetitive special token induction, and suppression of the
end-of-sequence (EOS) token, optimized via a dynamic weighting strategy.
Extensive experiments show that \textit{Hidden Tail} outperforms existing
attacks, increasing output length by up to 19.2$\times$ and reaching the
maximum token limit, while preserving attack stealthiness. These results
highlight the urgent need to improve the robustness of VLMs against
efficiency-oriented adversarial threats. Our code is available at

Abstract: As nature is ascribed as quantum, the fractals also pose some intriguing
appearance which is found in many micro and macro observable entities or
phenomena. Fractals show self-similarity across sizes; structures that resemble
the entire are revealed when zoomed in. In Quantum systems, the probability
density or wavefunction may exhibit recurring interference patterns at various
energy or length scales. Fractals are produced by basic iterative rules (such
as Mandelbrot or Julia sets), and they provide limitless complexity. Despite
its simplicity, the Schr\"odinger equation in quantum mechanics produces
incredibly intricate patterns of interference and entanglement, particularly in
chaotic quantum systems. Quantum computing, the root where lies to the using
the principles of quantum-mechanical phenomenon, when applied in fractal image
generation, what outcomes are expected? The paper outlines the generation of a
Julia set dataset using an approach coupled with building quantum circuit,
highlighting the concepts of superposition, randomness, and entanglement as
foundational elements to manipulate the generated dataset patterns. As Quantum
computing is finding many application areas, the possibility of using quantum
circuits for fractal Julia image generation posits a unique direction of future
research where it can be applied to quantum generative arts across various
ecosystems with a customised approach, such as producing an exciting landscape
based on a quantum art theme.

Motivation: 传统方法主要关注成对神经元连接，难以捕捉神经系统中超越成对连接的高维交互模式和信息流的全局组织结构。

Method: 使用传递熵量化神经元间的定向影响，生成加权有向图，然后应用定向持久同调学分析这些图的多尺度拓扑结构特征。

Result: 在合成网络、图像分类网络和小鼠皮层记录中均发现，复杂或噪声条件下高维拓扑特征更加显著，反映了超越成对连接性的交互模式。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一个原则性方法，可将定向信息流映射到人工和生物神经系统的全局组织模式上，具有通用性和可解释性，适用于时间分辨的二进制脉冲数据。

Abstract: We present a topological framework for analysing neural time series that
integrates Transfer Entropy (TE) with directed Persistent Homology (PH) to
characterize information flow in spiking neural systems. TE quantifies
directional influence between neurons, producing weighted, directed graphs that
reflect dynamic interactions. These graphs are then analyzed using PH, enabling
assessment of topological complexity across multiple structural scales and
dimensions.
  We apply this TE+PH pipeline to synthetic spiking networks trained on logic
gate tasks, image-classification networks exposed to structured and perturbed
inputs, and mouse cortical recordings annotated with behavioral events. Across
all settings, the resulting topological signatures reveal distinctions in task
complexity, stimulus structure, and behavioral regime. Higher-dimensional
features become more prominent in complex or noisy conditions, reflecting
interaction patterns that extend beyond pairwise connectivity. Our findings
offer a principled approach to mapping directed information flow onto global
organizational patterns in both artificial and biological neural systems. The
framework is generalizable and interpretable, making it well suited for neural
systems with time-resolved and binary spiking data.

TL;DR: 在HoloLens 2上评估目标物体透明度和工具可视化方式对深度感知和系统可用性的影响，发现不透明目标比透明目标深度估计误差更小，显示真实工具（遮挡虚拟目标）可获得最高精度和可用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 光学透视增强现实系统在手术等近距离引导应用中存在深度感知和真实工具遮挡的挑战，需要研究不同透明度和工具可视化方式对用户体验的影响。

Method: 在HoloLens 2上进行两个实验：实验1比较高低透明度目标在深度匹配任务中的表现；实验2在6种可视化条件下（2种透明度×3种工具模式）进行模拟手术精确定位任务，收集深度误差、定位误差、可用性等数据。

Result: 不透明目标的深度估计误差显著低于高透明目标；显示真实工具（遮挡虚拟目标）获得最高精度和可用性，最低工作负荷；不跟踪工具表现最差；高透明度目标虽然允许看到真实工具，但会轻微损害深度线索且未改善可用性。

Conclusion: 正确的遮挡线索、将虚拟内容渲染为不透明并由真实工具实时遮挡，对OST-AR的深度感知和精度至关重要。AR系统设计应优先考虑稳健的工具跟踪和遮挡处理，如不可用则谨慎使用透明度来平衡深度感知和工具可见性。

Abstract: Optical see-through augmented reality (OST-AR) systems like Microsoft
HoloLens 2 hold promise for arm's distance guidance (e.g., surgery), but depth
perception of the hologram and occlusion of real instruments remain
challenging. We present an evaluation of how visualizing the target object with
different transparencies and visualizing a tracked tool (virtual proxy vs. real
tool vs. no tool tracking) affects depth perception and system usability. Ten
participants performed two experiments on HoloLens 2. In Experiment 1, we
compared high-transparency vs. low-transparency target rendering in a depth
matching task at arm's length. In Experiment 2, participants performed a
simulated surgical pinpoint task on a frontal bone target under six
visualization conditions ($2 \times 3$: two target transparencies and three
tool visualization modes: virtual tool hologram, real tool, or no tool
tracking). We collected data on depth matching error, target localization
error, system usability, task workload, and qualitative feedback. Results show
that a more opaque target yields significantly lower depth estimation error
than a highly transparent target at arm's distance. Moreover, showing the real
tool (occluding the virtual target) led to the highest accuracy and usability
with the lowest workload, while not tracking the tool yielded the worst
performance and user ratings. However, making the target highly transparent,
while allowing the real tool to remain visible, slightly impaired depth cues
and did not improve usability. Our findings underscore that correct occlusion
cues, rendering virtual content opaque and occluding it with real tools in real
time, are critical for depth perception and precision in OST-AR. Designers of
arm-distance AR systems should prioritize robust tool tracking and occlusion
handling; if unavailable, cautiously use transparency to balance depth
perception and tool visibility.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自评估视觉隐喻生成框架，通过隐喻分解和意义对齐指标来提升生成质量，包含训练无关和训练相关两种方法，在多项指标上超越强基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉隐喻生成需要同时理解语言含义和保持视觉连贯性，现有方法在隐喻对齐方面存在不足，需要更好的评估和生成框架。

Method: 提出自评估框架，结合新提出的隐喻分解分数和意义对齐指标。包含两种方法：训练无关的S-T-M分解提示管道，以及基于自评估奖励的训练相关管道。

Result: 训练无关方法在分解、CLIP和MA分数上超越GPT-4o和Imagen等强基线，训练相关方法紧随其后。用户研究显示GPT-4o整体更受欢迎，但开源方法在抽象隐喻上表现优异。

Conclusion: 结构化提示和轻量级强化学习在有限计算资源下能有效进行隐喻对齐，与人类偏好的差距主要来自美学质量和采样设置敏感性。

Abstract: Visual metaphor generation is a challenging task that aims to generate an
image given an input text metaphor. Inherently, it needs language understanding
to bind a source concept with a target concept, in a way that preserves meaning
while ensuring visual coherence. We propose a self-evaluating visual metaphor
generation framework that focuses on metaphor alignment. Our self-evaluation
approach combines existing metrics with our newly proposed metaphor
decomposition score and a meaning alignment (MA) metric. Within this setup, we
explore two novel approaches: a training-free pipeline that explicitly
decomposes prompts into source-target-meaning (S-T-M) mapping for image
synthesis, and a complementary training-based pipeline that improves alignment
using our proposed self-evaluation reward schema, without any large-scale
retraining. On the held-out test set, the training-free approach surpasses
strong closed baselines (GPT-4o, Imagen) on decomposition, CLIP, and MA scores,
with the training-based approach close behind. We evaluate our framework output
using a user-facing study, and observed that participants preferred GPT-4o
overall, while our training-free pipeline led open-source methods and edged
Imagen on abstract metaphors. Our analyses show S-T-M prompting helps longer or
more abstract metaphors, with closed models excelling on short, concrete cases;
we also observe sensitivity to sampler settings. Overall, structured prompting
and lightweight RL perform metaphor alignment well under modest compute, and
remaining gaps to human preference appear driven by aesthetics and sampling.

TL;DR: 提出PAF-KIP方法解决开放集测试时适应问题，通过主辅助过滤器和知识集成预测来提升闭集准确率和开放集识别能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实测试数据常存在领域偏移和开放集数据，现有方法依赖源模型过滤导致性能下降，而适应模型用于过滤会导致不稳定和错误累积

Method: 提出PAF（主辅助过滤器）使用辅助过滤器验证主过滤器结果，以及KIP（知识集成预测）整合适应模型、EMA模型和源模型的互补知识

Result: 在多个闭集和开放集数据集上验证，方法在闭集准确率和开放集判别能力上均优于现有方法

Conclusion: PAF-KIP方法有效解决了开放集测试时适应中的过滤不稳定问题，通过多模型知识集成提升了整体性能

Abstract: Deep neural networks demonstrate strong performance under aligned
training-test distributions. However, real-world test data often exhibit domain
shifts. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses this challenge by adapting the
model to test data during inference. While most TTA studies assume that the
training and test data share the same class set (closed-set TTA), real-world
scenarios often involve open-set data (open-set TTA), which can degrade
closed-set accuracy. A recent study showed that identifying open-set data
during adaptation and maximizing its entropy is an effective solution. However,
the previous method relies on the source model for filtering, resulting in
suboptimal filtering accuracy on domain-shifted test data. In contrast, we
found that the adapting model, which learns domain knowledge from noisy test
streams, tends to be unstable and leads to error accumulation when used for
filtering. To address this problem, we propose Primary-Auxiliary Filtering
(PAF), which employs an auxiliary filter to validate data filtered by the
primary filter. Furthermore, we propose Knowledge-Integrated Prediction (KIP),
which calibrates the outputs of the adapting model, EMA model, and source model
to integrate their complementary knowledge for OSTTA. We validate our approach
across diverse closed-set and open-set datasets. Our method enhances both
closed-set accuracy and open-set discrimination over existing methods. The code
is available at https://github.com/powerpowe/PAF-KIP-OSTTA .
