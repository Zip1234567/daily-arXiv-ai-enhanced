Abstract: Despite recent advances in automated driving technology, impaired driving
continues to incur a high cost to society. In this paper, we present a driving
dataset designed to support the study of two common forms of driver impairment:
alcohol intoxication and cognitive distraction. Our dataset spans 23.7 hours of
simulated urban driving, with 52 human subjects under normal and impaired
conditions, and includes both vehicle data (ground truth perception, vehicle
pose, controls) and driver-facing data (gaze, audio, surveys). It supports
analysis of changes in driver behavior due to alcohol intoxication (0.10\%
blood alcohol content), two forms of cognitive distraction (audio n-back and
sentence parsing tasks), and combinations thereof, as well as responses to a
set of eight controlled road hazards, such as vehicle cut-ins. The dataset will
be made available at https://toyotaresearchinstitute.github.io/IDD/.

### [2] [Learning to Generate Vectorized Maps at Intersections with Multiple Roadside Cameras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02899)
*Miao Fan,Quanxin Zheng,Shengtong Xu,Linghe Kong,Haoyi Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MRC-VMap是一种基于视觉的端到端神经网络，用于直接从路口的多方向图像生成高清矢量地图，降低了成本且性能优于现有在线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统离线方法依赖昂贵的LiDAR数据和人工标注，而在线方法性能有限，尤其在复杂路口。MRC-VMap旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 利用路边监控摄像头的时间对齐多方向图像，直接转换为矢量地图，减少中间模块（如特征提取和BEV转换）的需求。

Result: 在4000个中国主要城市路口的实验中，MRC-VMap性能优于现有在线方法，且精度接近高成本的LiDAR方法。

Conclusion: MRC-VMap提供了一种可扩展且高效的解决方案，适用于现代自动驾驶导航系统。

Abstract: Vectorized maps are indispensable for precise navigation and the safe
operation of autonomous vehicles. Traditional methods for constructing these
maps fall into two categories: offline techniques, which rely on expensive,
labor-intensive LiDAR data collection and manual annotation, and online
approaches that use onboard cameras to reduce costs but suffer from limited
performance, especially at complex intersections. To bridge this gap, we
introduce MRC-VMap, a cost-effective, vision-centric, end-to-end neural network
designed to generate high-definition vectorized maps directly at intersections.
Leveraging existing roadside surveillance cameras, MRC-VMap directly converts
time-aligned, multi-directional images into vectorized map representations.
This integrated solution lowers the need for additional intermediate
modules--such as separate feature extraction and Bird's-Eye View (BEV)
conversion steps--thus reducing both computational overhead and error
propagation. Moreover, the use of multiple camera views enhances mapping
completeness, mitigates occlusions, and provides robust performance under
practical deployment constraints. Extensive experiments conducted on 4,000
intersections across 4 major metropolitan areas in China demonstrate that
MRC-VMap not only outperforms state-of-the-art online methods but also achieves
accuracy comparable to high-cost LiDAR-based approaches, thereby offering a
scalable and efficient solution for modern autonomous navigation systems.

Method: 评估MLLMs在分类网球动作及识别动作序列中的表现，并探索通过不同训练方法及与传统模型结合提升其性能。

Result: 未明确提及具体结果，但研究重点在于评估和改进MLLMs的性能。

Conclusion: MLLMs在网球视频分析中具有潜力，但仍需进一步优化以提高其性能。

Abstract: The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in recent years has also given rise
to the development of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). These new MLLMs allow us to
process images, videos and even audio alongside textual inputs. In this
project, we aim to assess the effectiveness of MLLMs in analysing sports
videos, focusing mainly on tennis videos. Despite research done on tennis
analysis, there remains a gap in models that are able to understand and
identify the sequence of events in a tennis rally, which would be useful in
other fields of sports analytics. As such, we will mainly assess the MLLMs on
their ability to fill this gap - to classify tennis actions, as well as their
ability to identify these actions in a sequence of tennis actions in a rally.
We further looked into ways we can improve the MLLMs' performance, including
different training methods and even using them together with other traditional
models.

Method: 采用标准化标注方法，结合GroundingDINO和YOLO-Pose进行球员定位和姿态估计，并利用CNN模型进行预测。

Result: CNN模型在预测击球类型、球员位置和阵型方面显著优于基于姿态的方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为网球双打的自动化战术分析和战略建模提供了基础。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive video-based analytics framework for tennis doubles
that addresses the lack of automated analysis tools for this strategically
complex sport. Our approach introduces a standardised annotation methodology
encompassing player positioning, shot types, court formations, and match
outcomes, coupled with a specialised annotation tool designed to meet the
unique requirements of tennis video labelling. The framework integrates
advanced machine learning techniques including GroundingDINO for precise player
localisation through natural language grounding and YOLO-Pose for robust pose
estimation. This combination significantly reduces manual annotation effort
whilst improving data consistency and quality. We evaluate our approach on
doubles tennis match data and demonstrate that CNN-based models with transfer
learning substantially outperform pose-based methods for predicting shot types,
player positioning, and formations. The CNN models effectively capture complex
visual and contextual features essential for doubles tennis analysis. Our
integrated system bridges advanced analytical capabilities with the strategic
complexities of tennis doubles, providing a foundation for automated tactical
analysis, performance evaluation, and strategic modelling in professional
tennis.

*Seokyeong Lee,Sithu Aung,Junyong Choi,Seungryong Kim,Ig-Jae Kim,Junghyun Cho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种仅使用视频数据的伪标签框架，用于单目3D目标检测，无需多视角设置或额外传感器，通过对象点跟踪聚合静态和动态对象的伪LiDAR数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单目3D目标检测中数据稀缺和2D到3D模糊性问题，避免依赖领域特定学习或单次观测的形状信息。

Method: 利用视频数据，通过对象点跟踪聚合相邻帧中静态和动态对象的伪LiDAR数据，提取3D属性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在精度和可扩展性上表现优异，适用于3D数据获取不可行的情况。

Conclusion: 该方法为单目3D目标检测提供了一种实用且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection (M3OD) has long faced challenges due to data
scarcity caused by high annotation costs and inherent 2D-to-3D ambiguity.
Although various weakly supervised methods and pseudo-labeling methods have
been proposed to address these issues, they are mostly limited by
domain-specific learning or rely solely on shape information from a single
observation. In this paper, we propose a novel pseudo-labeling framework that
uses only video data and is more robust to occlusion, without requiring a
multi-view setup, additional sensors, camera poses, or domain-specific
training. Specifically, we explore a technique for aggregating the
pseudo-LiDARs of both static and dynamic objects across temporally adjacent
frames using object point tracking, enabling 3D attribute extraction in
scenarios where 3D data acquisition is infeasible. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method ensures reliable accuracy and strong scalability,
making it a practical and effective solution for M3OD.

TL;DR: 利用街景图像建模食物不安全问题，提出特征提取和门控注意力聚合的两步方法，虽预测能力稍弱，但可作为现有方法的补充。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 食物不安全是全球城市面临的重大社会与公共卫生问题，现有依赖调查数据的方法难以扩展。

Method: 提出两步法：特征提取和门控注意力图像聚合，并与其他模型架构对比评估。

Result: 模型预测能力略逊，但权重解释和案例研究表明其潜力。

Conclusion: 该方法可作为城市规划和政策制定中识别食物不安全的补充工具。

Abstract: Food insecurity is a significant social and public health issue that plagues
many urban metropolitan areas around the world. Existing approaches to
identifying food insecurity rely primarily on qualitative and quantitative
survey data, which is difficult to scale. This project seeks to explore the
effectiveness of using street-level images in modeling food insecurity at the
census tract level. To do so, we propose a two-step process of feature
extraction and gated attention for image aggregation. We evaluate the
effectiveness of our model by comparing against other model architectures,
interpreting our learned weights, and performing a case study. While our model
falls slightly short in terms of its predictive power, we believe our approach
still has the potential to supplement existing methods of identifying food
insecurity for urban planners and policymakers.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实现开放世界和真实环境中子环境的零样本识别，提升自主环境理解能力。

Result: 在链式检索任务中优于场景方法，支持零样本环境识别。

Conclusion: OBSER框架为自主环境理解提供了可靠且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: We present the Object-Based Sub-Environment Recognition (OBSER) framework, a
novel Bayesian framework that infers three fundamental relationships between
sub-environments and their constituent objects. In the OBSER framework, metric
and self-supervised learning models estimate the object distributions of
sub-environments on the latent space to compute these measures. Both
theoretically and empirically, we validate the proposed framework by
introducing the ($\epsilon,\delta$) statistically separable (EDS) function
which indicates the alignment of the representation. Our framework reliably
performs inference in open-world and photorealistic environments and
outperforms scene-based methods in chained retrieval tasks. The OBSER framework
enables zero-shot recognition of environments to achieve autonomous environment
understanding.

### [9] [GameTileNet: A Semantic Dataset for Low-Resolution Game Art in Procedural Content Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02941)
*Yi-Chun Chen,Arnav Jhala*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GameTileNet是一个低分辨率游戏图块的语义数据集，旨在通过视觉-语言对齐支持叙事驱动的程序化内容生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI生成游戏视觉资产与叙事对齐的挑战，以及训练数据分布不均导致的生成内容多样性受限问题。

Method: 收集艺术家创作的游戏图块，提供语义标注，并开发低分辨率图块对象检测流程。

Result: 数据集支持叙事驱动的游戏内容生成，并为低分辨率非真实感图像的对象检测提供基准。

Conclusion: GameTileNet是改进程序化内容生成方法、丰富游戏叙事的宝贵资源。

Abstract: GameTileNet is a dataset designed to provide semantic labels for
low-resolution digital game art, advancing procedural content generation (PCG)
and related AI research as a vision-language alignment task. Large Language
Models (LLMs) and image-generative AI models have enabled indie developers to
create visual assets, such as sprites, for game interactions. However,
generating visuals that align with game narratives remains challenging due to
inconsistent AI outputs, requiring manual adjustments by human artists. The
diversity of visual representations in automatically generated game content is
also limited because of the imbalance in distributions across styles for
training data. GameTileNet addresses this by collecting artist-created game
tiles from OpenGameArt.org under Creative Commons licenses and providing
semantic annotations to support narrative-driven content generation. The
dataset introduces a pipeline for object detection in low-resolution tile-based
game art (e.g., 32x32 pixels) and annotates semantics, connectivity, and object
classifications. GameTileNet is a valuable resource for improving PCG methods,
supporting narrative-rich game content, and establishing a baseline for object
detection in low-resolution, non-photorealistic images.
  TL;DR: GameTileNet is a semantic dataset of low-resolution game tiles
designed to support narrative-driven procedural content generation through
visual-language alignment.

### [10] [Iterative Zoom-In: Temporal Interval Exploration for Long Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02946)
*Chenglin Li,Qianglong Chen,fengtao,Yin Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Temporal Search（TS）的无训练框架，通过迭代探索时间区域来提升多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）对长视频的理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs在处理长视频时因时间感知效率低下而表现不佳，TS旨在通过动态调整时间焦点来解决这一问题。

Method: TS通过两个迭代阶段实现：1）模型提出可能包含任务相关信息的时间区间；2）从区间中采样固定数量帧，生成细化响应和置信度分数。TS-BFS进一步引入最佳优先搜索策略。

Result: TS通过动态调整时间焦点，显著提升了MLLMs对长视频的理解能力，同时降低了内存消耗。

Conclusion: TS为MLLMs提供了一种高效的长视频理解方法，未来可扩展至其他多模态任务。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown strong performance in
video understanding tasks. However, they continue to struggle with long-form
videos because of an inefficient perception of temporal intervals. Unlike
humans, who can dynamically adjust their temporal focus to locate
query-relevant moments, current MLLMs often rely on dense, uniform sampling
across the video timeline, leading to high memory consumption and a risk of
missing crucial information. To address this challenge, we introduce Temporal
Search, a training-free framework that enables MLLMs to explore temporal
regions for improved long video understanding iteratively. TS is based on a key
observation: the model's generation confidence across different temporal
intervals is highly correlated with prediction accuracy. TS operates through
two main iterative stages. First, the MLLM proposes a temporal interval that is
likely to contain task-relevant information. Then, it samples a fixed number of
frames from the interval, regardless of length, and feeds them into the model
to produce a refined response and confidence score. TS refines the focus of the
model by iteratively shifting attention to more fine-grained temporal
intervals, improving its understanding of long videos. Additionally,
keyframe-level descriptions are collected to facilitate cross-interval
perception throughout the video. To further improve efficiency, we introduce
TS-BFS, a best-first search strategy over a tree. Each node represents a
candidate interval and is expanded via two methods: self-driven proposals and
uniform partitioning. Nodes are scored based on confidence and self-evaluation,
and the most promising one is selected for continued exploration.

Conclusion: 该方法通过合成数据和创新框架，显著提升了VLM在运动风险预测中的性能，并展示了强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Autonomous driving has seen significant progress, driven by extensive
real-world data. However, in long-tail scenarios, accurately predicting the
safety of the ego vehicle's future motion remains a major challenge due to
uncertainties in dynamic environments and limitations in data coverage. In this
work, we aim to explore whether it is possible to enhance the motion risk
prediction capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLM) by synthesizing
high-risk motion data. Specifically, we introduce a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) based
motion simulation method to model risks from three aspects: the ego-vehicle,
other vehicles, and the environment. This allows us to synthesize
plug-and-play, high-risk motion data suitable for VLM training, which we call
DriveMRP-10K. Furthermore, we design a VLM-agnostic motion risk estimation
framework, named DriveMRP-Agent. This framework incorporates a novel
information injection strategy for global context, ego-vehicle perspective, and
trajectory projection, enabling VLMs to effectively reason about the spatial
relationships between motion waypoints and the environment. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that by fine-tuning with DriveMRP-10K, our
DriveMRP-Agent framework can significantly improve the motion risk prediction
performance of multiple VLM baselines, with the accident recognition accuracy
soaring from 27.13% to 88.03%. Moreover, when tested via zero-shot evaluation
on an in-house real-world high-risk motion dataset, DriveMRP-Agent achieves a
significant performance leap, boosting the accuracy from base_model's 29.42% to
68.50%, which showcases the strong generalization capabilities of our method in
real-world scenarios.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在传染病大流行（如埃博拉、SARS）期间，快速、非侵入性的发热筛查方法至关重要，红外热成像是一种可行的解决方案。

Method: 提出了一种基于标志点和眼轮廓边缘检测的粗-细配准策略，通过多模态配准红外和白光图像。

Result: 配准精度在2.7毫米以内，实现了眼角区域的精确定位。

Conclusion: 该方法为发热筛查提供了高精度的眼角区域定位，适用于公共场所的温度监测。

Abstract: Fever screening based on infrared thermographs (IRTs) is a viable mass
screening approach during infectious disease pandemics, such as Ebola and SARS,
for temperature monitoring in public places like hospitals and airports. IRTs
have found to be powerful, quick and non-invasive methods to detect elevated
temperatures. Moreover, regions medially adjacent to the inner canthi (called
the canthi regions in this paper) are preferred sites for fever screening.
Accurate localization of the canthi regions can be achieved through multi-modal
registration of infrared (IR) and white-light images. We proposed a
registration method through a coarse-fine registration strategy using different
registration models based on landmarks and edge detection on eye contours. We
evaluated the registration accuracy to be within 2.7 mm, which enables accurate
localization of the canthi regions.

*Andrew Kiruluta,Preethi Raju,Priscilla Burity*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CSAT是一种新型注意力机制，通过压缩感知降低计算复杂度，适用于视觉语言模型（vLLMs），显著减少内存和延迟成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准注意力机制的二次复杂度在vLLMs中成为计算瓶颈，尤其是在跨模态计算时，内存和延迟成本过高。

Method: CSAT通过随机测量矩阵将高维键值表示投影到低维子空间，并利用稀疏恢复算法重建注意力输出。

Result: CSAT在保持语义保真度的同时显著降低了注意力复杂度，适用于视频和语言的高压缩性场景。

Conclusion: CSAT为下一代多模态Transformer提供了一种可扩展、可解释且资源高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (vLLMs) have emerged as powerful architectures for
joint reasoning over visual and textual inputs, enabling breakthroughs in image
captioning, cross modal retrieval, and multimodal dialogue. However, as these
models scale to longer video sequences and richer language descriptions, the
quadratic complexity of the standard attention mechanism presents a fundamental
computational bottleneck. This challenge is exacerbated in vLLMs, where
attention must be computed not only within modalities but also across them,
leading to prohibitive memory and latency costs. In this work, we introduce the
Compressed Sensing Attention Transformer (CSAT), a novel architecture that
reimagines attention computation through the lens of compressed sensing. By
projecting high dimensional key and value representations into a
lower-dimensional subspace via random measurement matrices and reconstructing
the attention outputs using sparse recovery algorithms, CSAT significantly
reduces attention complexity while maintaining semantic fidelity. Applied to
vLLMs, CSAT exploits the inherent compressibility of both visual and textual
representations especially evident in video, where temporal redundancy is high,
and in language, where cross-modal grounding is often sparse. In contrast to
LLMs, which must often model entangled symbolic dependencies, vLLMs benefit
from structured sparsity in alignment and scene composition, making them
particularly well-suited to compressed attention. We provide a formal
mathematical treatment of CSAT, demonstrate its integration into vision
language pipelines, and validate its performance on standard benchmarks,
highlighting its promise as a scalable, interpretable, and resource efficient
solution for next generation multimodal transformers.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SeqTex是一个端到端的框架，直接生成完整的UV纹理贴图，避免了传统方法中的误差积累和空间不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏大规模高质量的3D纹理数据集，现有方法通常依赖后处理生成UV纹理贴图，导致误差积累和空间不一致。

Method: SeqTex将任务重新定义为序列生成问题，利用预训练视频基础模型的视觉知识，通过多视图和UV分支设计、几何感知注意力等技术直接生成UV纹理贴图。

Result: SeqTex在图像和文本条件下的3D纹理生成任务中实现了最先进的性能，具有更好的3D一致性、纹理-几何对齐和泛化能力。

Conclusion: SeqTex通过端到端设计和预训练视频模型的利用，显著提升了3D纹理生成的质量和效率。

Abstract: Training native 3D texture generative models remains a fundamental yet
challenging problem, largely due to the limited availability of large-scale,
high-quality 3D texture datasets. This scarcity hinders generalization to
real-world scenarios. To address this, most existing methods finetune
foundation image generative models to exploit their learned visual priors.
However, these approaches typically generate only multi-view images and rely on
post-processing to produce UV texture maps -- an essential representation in
modern graphics pipelines. Such two-stage pipelines often suffer from error
accumulation and spatial inconsistencies across the 3D surface. In this paper,
we introduce SeqTex, a novel end-to-end framework that leverages the visual
knowledge encoded in pretrained video foundation models to directly generate
complete UV texture maps. Unlike previous methods that model the distribution
of UV textures in isolation, SeqTex reformulates the task as a sequence
generation problem, enabling the model to learn the joint distribution of
multi-view renderings and UV textures. This design effectively transfers the
consistent image-space priors from video foundation models into the UV domain.
To further enhance performance, we propose several architectural innovations: a
decoupled multi-view and UV branch design, geometry-informed attention to guide
cross-domain feature alignment, and adaptive token resolution to preserve fine
texture details while maintaining computational efficiency. Together, these
components allow SeqTex to fully utilize pretrained video priors and synthesize
high-fidelity UV texture maps without the need for post-processing. Extensive
experiments show that SeqTex achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
image-conditioned and text-conditioned 3D texture generation tasks, with
superior 3D consistency, texture-geometry alignment, and real-world
generalization.

Conclusion: VR-YOLO在PCB缺陷检测中表现出优异的泛化能力和视角鲁棒性，适用于实际工业场景。

Abstract: The integration of large-scale circuits and systems emphasizes the importance
of automated defect detection of electronic components. The YOLO image
detection model has been used to detect PCB defects and it has become a typical
AI-assisted case of traditional industrial production. However, conventional
detection algorithms have stringent requirements for the angle, orientation,
and clarity of target images. In this paper, we propose an enhanced PCB defect
detection algorithm, named VR-YOLO, based on the YOLOv8 model. This algorithm
aims to improve the model's generalization performance and enhance viewpoint
robustness in practical application scenarios. We first propose a diversified
scene enhancement (DSE) method by expanding the PCB defect dataset by
incorporating diverse scenarios and segmenting samples to improve target
diversity. A novel key object focus (KOF) scheme is then presented by
considering angular loss and introducing an additional attention mechanism to
enhance fine-grained learning of small target features. Experimental results
demonstrate that our improved PCB defect detection approach achieves a mean
average precision (mAP) of 98.9% for the original test images, and 94.7% for
the test images with viewpoint shifts (horizontal and vertical shear
coefficients of $\pm 0.06$ and rotation angle of $\pm 10$ degrees), showing
significant improvements compared to the baseline YOLO model with negligible
additional computational cost.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于概念的对抗攻击框架，通过概率视角生成多样化的对抗样本，保持原始概念的同时误导分类器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对抗攻击仅针对单张图像，缺乏多样性和概念保持能力。本文旨在扩展攻击范围至整个概念，生成更有效且多样的对抗样本。

Method: 采用概率生成模型或图像集表示概念，从中采样生成对抗样本，确保样本在姿态、视角或背景上多样化，同时保留原始概念。

Result: 理论及实验证明，该方法能生成更多样化的对抗样本，有效保留概念，并提高攻击效率。

Conclusion: 概念对抗攻击框架在多样性和效率上优于传统方法，为对抗攻击研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: We propose a concept-based adversarial attack framework that extends beyond
single-image perturbations by adopting a probabilistic perspective. Rather than
modifying a single image, our method operates on an entire concept --
represented by a probabilistic generative model or a set of images -- to
generate diverse adversarial examples. Preserving the concept is essential, as
it ensures that the resulting adversarial images remain identifiable as
instances of the original underlying category or identity. By sampling from
this concept-based adversarial distribution, we generate images that maintain
the original concept but vary in pose, viewpoint, or background, thereby
misleading the classifier. Mathematically, this framework remains consistent
with traditional adversarial attacks in a principled manner. Our theoretical
and empirical results demonstrate that concept-based adversarial attacks yield
more diverse adversarial examples and effectively preserve the underlying
concept, while achieving higher attack efficiency.

Conclusion: AI技术（尤其是YOLOv11）在低能见度水下管道检测中具有潜力。

Abstract: Condition monitoring subsea pipelines in low-visibility underwater
environments poses significant challenges due to turbidity, light distortion,
and image degradation. Traditional visual-based inspection systems often fail
to provide reliable data for mapping, object recognition, or defect detection
in such conditions. This study explores the integration of advanced artificial
intelligence (AI) techniques to enhance image quality, detect pipeline
structures, and support autonomous fault diagnosis. This study conducts a
comparative analysis of two most robust versions of YOLOv8 and Yolov11 and
their three variants tailored for image segmentation tasks in complex and
low-visibility subsea environments. Using pipeline inspection datasets captured
beneath the seabed, it evaluates model performance in accurately delineating
target structures under challenging visual conditions. The results indicated
that YOLOv11 outperformed YOLOv8 in overall performance.

<details>

Motivation: 解决现有作物监测方法在地理可扩展性、作物类型覆盖、混合像素和异质景观复杂性以及季节内识别方面的不足，为农业决策提供支持。

Method: 整合Sentinel-1和Sentinel-2卫星图像与农场边界数据，开发自动化季节检测算法，构建可扩展的推理管道。

Result: 成功识别12种主要作物（占印度总种植面积的90%），与2023-24年国家作物普查数据一致（冬季94%，雨季75%）。

Conclusion: 该框架具有高度可扩展性，为印度农业监测和管理提供了可行的数据驱动解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate, timely, and farm-level crop type information is paramount for
national food security, agricultural policy formulation, and economic planning,
particularly in agriculturally significant nations like India. While remote
sensing and machine learning have become vital tools for crop monitoring,
existing approaches often grapple with challenges such as limited geographical
scalability, restricted crop type coverage, the complexities of mixed-pixel and
heterogeneous landscapes, and crucially, the robust in-season identification
essential for proactive decision-making.
  We present a framework designed to address the critical data gaps for
targeted data driven decision making which generates farm-level, in-season,
multi-crop identification at national scale (India) using deep learning. Our
methodology leverages the strengths of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite
imagery, integrated with national-scale farm boundary data. The model
successfully identifies 12 major crops (which collectively account for nearly
90% of India's total cultivated area showing an agreement with national crop
census 2023-24 of 94% in winter, and 75% in monsoon season). Our approach
incorporates an automated season detection algorithm, which estimates crop
sowing and harvest periods. This allows for reliable crop identification as
early as two months into the growing season and facilitates rigorous in-season
performance evaluation. Furthermore, we have engineered a highly scalable
inference pipeline, culminating in what is, to our knowledge, the first
pan-India, in-season, farm-level crop type data product. The system's
effectiveness and scalability are demonstrated through robust validation
against national agricultural statistics, showcasing its potential to deliver
actionable, data-driven insights for transformative agricultural monitoring and
management across India.

Motivation: 探索AI在重现或重新想象神圣叙事中的能力，以及其生成的图像在美学、神学和作者意图方面的表现。

Method: 使用MidJourney生成图像，并通过比较视觉分析（包括Google图像和古典绘画）评估AI图像的风格、神学和文化维度。

Result: AI能生成美学丰富的图像，但受限于训练数据的偏见；其在创造力、作者意图和神学深度方面存在不足。

Conclusion: AI可作为圣经文本重新解读的创意伙伴，但其在神圣艺术中的角色仍具争议。

Abstract: This study explores the intersection of artificial intelligence and the
visualization of Biblical narratives by analyzing AI-generated images of Exodus
2:5-9 (Moses found in River Nile) using MidJourney. Drawing on the classical
concepts of mimesis (imitation) and poiesis (creative generation), the authors
investigate how text-to-image (T2I) models reproduce or reimagine sacred
narratives. Through comparative visual analysis, including Google image results
and classical paintings, the research evaluates the stylistic, theological, and
cultural dimensions of AI-generated depictions. Findings show that while AI
excels in producing aesthetically rich and imaginative visuals, it also
reflects the biases and limitations of its training data. The study highlights
AI's potential to augment human imagination but questions its capacity for
genuine creativity, authorial intent, and theological depth. It concludes by
suggesting that AI can serve as a creative partner in reinterpreting biblical
texts, though its role in sacred art remains complex and contested.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的评估框架，用于测试视觉语言模型在空间变形推理任务中的表现，发现现有模型在此类任务中表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类天生具备空间推理能力，但目前尚不清楚视觉语言模型是否真正理解和操作空间对象。

Method: 构建了一个从2D到3D的空间变形推理基准，采用阶梯式竞赛形式评估模型能力。

Result: 几乎所有模型在空间变形推理任务中表现不佳，即使经过针对性训练和主流推理增强方法后仍无法胜任。

Conclusion: 现有视觉语言模型在空间变形推理任务中存在显著局限性，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Humans naturally possess the spatial reasoning ability to form and manipulate
images and structures of objects in space. There is an increasing effort to
endow Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with similar spatial reasoning
capabilities. However, it remains unclear whether these models truly understand
and manipulate spatial objects or not. To address this question, we propose a
new evaluation framework aimed at assessing the performance of VLMs in spatial
deformation reasoning tasks. Specifically, we construct a benchmark for spatial
deformation reasoning from 2D to 3D. Leveraging our data engine, we can
generate unlimited evaluation problem pairs with infinite steps, without any
data leakage. We explore whether the model can effectively perform spatial
deformation reasoning from two directions: forward reasoning (given the
operations, find the final state) and reverse reasoning (given the final state,
determine the operations). We adopt a ladder competition format, using the
number of deformation steps as the level classification criterion, with the
goal of exploring the boundaries of the model's deformation reasoning
capabilities. Interestingly, the benchmarking results reveal that almost no
model demonstrates plausible spatial deformation reasoning abilities.
Furthermore, even after applying targeted training and mainstream reasoning
enhancement methods, the models are still unable to perform well on 3D spatial
deformation reasoning.

Motivation: 医学数据集常存在噪声、错误标签或泛化性差的图像，且样本量小易导致过拟合，可能对诊断产生严重影响。需要高效的数据训练策略来解决这些问题。

Method: 提出IMET框架，结合课程学习和核心集选择，通过迭代识别误分类样本，优化训练过程，重点关注边缘案例和罕见结果。

Result: 在医学图像分类基准数据集上，IMET表现优于现有ResNet架构，提升了模型的鲁棒性和准确性。

Conclusion: IMET为医学图像分析提供了一种高效且通用的训练策略，能够显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Deep learning models have proven to be effective on medical datasets for
accurate diagnostic predictions from images. However, medical datasets often
contain noisy, mislabeled, or poorly generalizable images, particularly for
edge cases and anomalous outcomes. Additionally, high quality datasets are
often small in sample size that can result in overfitting, where models
memorize noise rather than learn generalizable patterns. This in particular,
could pose serious risks in medical diagnostics where the risk associated with
mis-classification can impact human life. Several data-efficient training
strategies have emerged to address these constraints. In particular, coreset
selection identifies compact subsets of the most representative samples,
enabling training that approximates full-dataset performance while reducing
computational overhead. On the other hand, curriculum learning relies on
gradually increasing training difficulty and accelerating convergence. However,
developing a generalizable difficulty ranking mechanism that works across
diverse domains, datasets, and models while reducing the computational tasks
and remains challenging. In this paper, we introduce Iterative
Misclassification Error Training (IMET), a novel framework inspired by
curriculum learning and coreset selection. The IMET approach is aimed to
identify misclassified samples in order to streamline the training process,
while prioritizing the model's attention to edge case senarious and rare
outcomes. The paper evaluates IMET's performance on benchmark medical image
classification datasets against state-of-the-art ResNet architectures. The
results demonstrating IMET's potential for enhancing model robustness and
accuracy in medical image analysis are also presented in the paper.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态学习中深度融合与计算可扩展性之间的矛盾，特别是针对多模态环境下的高计算复杂度问题。

Method: 采用循环处理模态序列的方式，通过Transformer解码器层进行对称交叉注意力，并结合门控融合单元（GFU）动态控制信息流。

Result: 在CMU-MOSI基准测试中表现优异，生成结构化且类别可分的表示。

Conclusion: GRF为高效且强大的多模态表示学习提供了新范式。

Abstract: Multimodal learning faces a fundamental tension between deep, fine-grained
fusion and computational scalability. While cross-attention models achieve
strong performance through exhaustive pairwise fusion, their quadratic
complexity is prohibitive for settings with many modalities. We address this
challenge with Gated Recurrent Fusion (GRF), a novel architecture that captures
the power of cross-modal attention within a linearly scalable, recurrent
pipeline. Our method processes modalities sequentially, updating an evolving
multimodal context vector at each step. The core of our approach is a fusion
block built on Transformer Decoder layers that performs symmetric
cross-attention, mutually enriching the shared context and the incoming
modality. This enriched information is then integrated via a Gated Fusion Unit
(GFU) a GRU-inspired mechanism that dynamically arbitrates information flow,
enabling the model to selectively retain or discard features. This stateful,
recurrent design scales linearly with the number of modalities, O(n), making it
ideal for high-modality environments. Experiments on the CMU-MOSI benchmark
demonstrate that GRF achieves competitive performance compared to more complex
baselines. Visualizations of the embedding space further illustrate that GRF
creates structured, class-separable representations through its progressive
fusion mechanism. Our work presents a robust and efficient paradigm for
powerful, scalable multimodal representation learning.

Conclusion: 为数据稀缺但结构化的领域提供了一种轻量级、模态无关的预训练方案。

Abstract: Building generalizable medical AI systems requires pretraining strategies
that are data-efficient and domain-aware. Unlike internet-scale corpora,
clinical datasets such as MIMIC-CXR offer limited image counts and scarce
annotations, but exhibit rich internal structure through multi-view imaging. We
propose a self-supervised framework that leverages the inherent structure of
medical datasets. Specifically, we treat paired chest X-rays (i.e., frontal and
lateral views) as natural positive pairs, learning to reconstruct each view
from sparse patches while aligning their latent embeddings. Our method requires
no textual supervision and produces informative representations. Evaluated on
MIMIC-CXR, we show strong performance compared to supervised objectives and
baselines being trained without leveraging structure. This work provides a
lightweight, modality-agnostic blueprint for domain-specific pretraining where
data is structured but scarce

Abstract: The rapid advancement of diffusion models, particularly Stable Diffusion 3.5,
has enabled the generation of highly photorealistic synthetic images that pose
significant challenges to existing detection methods. This paper presents
FreqCross, a novel multi-modal fusion network that combines spatial RGB
features, frequency domain artifacts, and radial energy distribution patterns
to achieve robust detection of AI-generated images. Our approach leverages a
three-branch architecture: (1) a ResNet-18 backbone for spatial feature
extraction, (2) a lightweight CNN for processing 2D FFT magnitude spectra, and
(3) a multi-layer perceptron for analyzing radial energy profiles. We introduce
a novel radial energy distribution analysis that captures characteristic
frequency artifacts inherent in diffusion-generated images, and fuse it with
spatial and spectral cues via simple feature concatenation followed by a
compact classification head. Extensive experiments on a dataset of 10,000
paired real (MS-COCO) and synthetic (Stable Diffusion 3.5) images demonstrate
that FreqCross achieves 97.8\% accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art
baselines by 5.2\%. The frequency analysis further reveals that synthetic

Conclusion: TG-MILNet为脊柱侧弯早期检测提供了一种高效、非侵入的解决方案。

Abstract: Early-stage scoliosis is often difficult to detect, particularly in
adolescents, where delayed diagnosis can lead to serious health issues.
Traditional X-ray-based methods carry radiation risks and rely heavily on
clinical expertise, limiting their use in large-scale screenings. To overcome
these challenges, we propose a Text-Guided Multi-Instance Learning Network
(TG-MILNet) for non-invasive scoliosis detection using gait videos. To handle
temporal misalignment in gait sequences, we employ Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)
clustering to segment videos into key gait phases. To focus on the most
relevant diagnostic features, we introduce an Inter-Bag Temporal Attention
(IBTA) mechanism that highlights critical gait phases. Recognizing the
difficulty in identifying borderline cases, we design a Boundary-Aware Model
(BAM) to improve sensitivity to subtle spinal deviations. Additionally, we
incorporate textual guidance from domain experts and large language models
(LLM) to enhance feature representation and improve model interpretability.
Experiments on the large-scale Scoliosis1K gait dataset show that TG-MILNet
achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly excelling in handling class
imbalance and accurately detecting challenging borderline cases. The code is

Method: 使用HOG和TDA分别提取特征，训练七种经典机器学习模型，并通过10折交叉验证评估性能。

Result: XGBoost在二分类和多分类任务中表现最佳，HOG和TDA准确率相近（二分类约94%，多分类约74%）。

Conclusion: HOG和TDA在视网膜图像分类中表现竞争性且互补，适用于其他医学图像领域，并可整合到深度学习流程中。

Abstract: We present the first comparative study of two fundamentally distinct feature
extraction techniques: Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and Topological
Data Analysis (TDA), for medical image classification using retinal fundus
images. HOG captures local texture and edge patterns through gradient
orientation histograms, while TDA, using cubical persistent homology, extracts
high-level topological signatures that reflect the global structure of pixel
intensities. We evaluate both methods on the large APTOS dataset for two
classification tasks: binary detection (normal versus diabetic retinopathy) and
five-class diabetic retinopathy severity grading. From each image, we extract
26244 HOG features and 800 TDA features, using them independently to train
seven classical machine learning models with 10-fold cross-validation. XGBoost
achieved the best performance in both cases: 94.29 percent accuracy (HOG) and
94.18 percent (TDA) on the binary task; 74.41 percent (HOG) and 74.69 percent
(TDA) on the multi-class task. Our results show that both methods offer
competitive performance but encode different structural aspects of the images.
This is the first work to benchmark gradient-based and topological features on
retinal imagery. The techniques are interpretable, applicable to other medical
imaging domains, and suitable for integration into deep learning pipelines.

Abstract: Performance measures such as stride length in athletics and the pace of
runners can be estimated using different tricks such as measuring the number of
steps divided by the running length or helping with markers printed on the
track. Monitoring individual performance is essential for supporting staff
coaches in establishing a proper training schedule for each athlete. The aim of
this paper is to investigate a computer vision-based approach for estimating
stride length and speed transition from video sequences and assessing video
analysis processing among athletes. Using some well-known image processing
methodologies such as probabilistic hough transform combined with a human pose
detection algorithm, we estimate the leg joint position of runners. In this
way, applying a homography transformation, we can estimate the runner stride
length. Experiments on various race videos with three different runners
demonstrated that the proposed system represents a useful tool for coaching and
training. This suggests its potential value in measuring and monitoring the
gait parameters of athletes.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Look-Back的隐式方法，引导多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在推理过程中自发重新关注视觉输入，无需显式注入视觉信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs在推理后期过度依赖文本信息，忽视了视觉输入的整合。现有方法通常通过显式注入视觉信息来引导推理，但研究发现MLLMs在适当引导下可以自发重新关注视觉输入。

Method: 通过分析MLLM的注意力模式，提出Look-Back方法，引导模型在推理过程中自主决定何时、何地以及如何重新关注视觉输入。

Result: Look-Back显著提升了模型的推理和感知能力，在多个多模态基准测试中表现出色。

Conclusion: 研究证明MLLMs具备内在的视觉融合推理能力，Look-Back方法为多模态推理提供了一种高效且隐式的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
multimodal reasoning. However, they often excessively rely on textual
information during the later stages of inference, neglecting the crucial
integration of visual input. Current methods typically address this by
explicitly injecting visual information to guide the reasoning process. In this
work, through an analysis of MLLM attention patterns, we made an intriguing
observation: with appropriate guidance, MLLMs can spontaneously re-focus their
attention on visual inputs during the later stages of reasoning, even without
explicit visual information injection. This spontaneous shift in focus suggests
that MLLMs are intrinsically capable of performing visual fusion reasoning.
Building on this insight, we introduce Look-Back, an implicit approach designed
to guide MLLMs to ``look back" at visual information in a self-directed manner
during reasoning. Look-Back empowers the model to autonomously determine when,
where, and how to re-focus on visual inputs, eliminating the need for explicit
model-structure constraints or additional input. We demonstrate that Look-Back
significantly enhances the model's reasoning and perception capabilities, as
evidenced by extensive empirical evaluations on multiple multimodal benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统术中病理工作流程基于光镜和H&E组织学，速度慢、资源密集且缺乏实时数字成像能力，亟需改进。

Method: 智能组织学整合AI与SRH技术，SRH可在数秒内生成高分辨率数字图像，支持AI驱动的肿瘤组织学分析、分子分类及浸润检测。

Result: 该方法在神经外科多个领域（如肿瘤、脊柱、儿科肿瘤等）展示了变革潜力，未来将开发多机构数据集和AI基础模型。

Conclusion: 智能组织学是一种变革性的术中工作流程，有望重塑21世纪神经外科的实时肿瘤分析。

Abstract: The importance of rapid and accurate histologic analysis of surgical tissue
in the operating room has been recognized for over a century. Our
standard-of-care intraoperative pathology workflow is based on light microscopy
and H\&E histology, which is slow, resource-intensive, and lacks real-time
digital imaging capabilities. Here, we present an emerging and innovative
method for intraoperative histologic analysis, called Intelligent Histology,
that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) with stimulated Raman histology
(SRH). SRH is a rapid, label-free, digital imaging method for real-time
microscopic tumor tissue analysis. SRH generates high-resolution digital images
of surgical specimens within seconds, enabling AI-driven tumor histologic
analysis, molecular classification, and tumor infiltration detection. We review
the scientific background, clinical translation, and future applications of
intelligent histology in tumor neurosurgery. We focus on the major scientific
and clinical studies that have demonstrated the transformative potential of
intelligent histology across multiple neurosurgical specialties, including
neurosurgical oncology, skull base, spine oncology, pediatric tumors, and
periperal nerve tumors. Future directions include the development of AI
foundation models through multi-institutional datasets, incorporating clinical
and radiologic data for multimodal learning, and predicting patient outcomes.
Intelligent histology represents a transformative intraoperative workflow that
can reinvent real-time tumor analysis for 21st century neurosurgery.

deep learning model to mitigate potential accidents. The technique incorporates
real-time video data to identify railway tracks with impressive accuracy and
recognizes nearby moving objects within a one-meter range, specifically
targeting the identification of humans. This system aims to enhance safety
measures in railway environments by providing real-time alerts for any detected
human presence close to the track. The integration of a functionality to
identify objects at a longer distance further fortifies the preventative
capabilities of the system. With a precise focus on real-time object detection,
this method is poised to deliver significant contributions to the existing
technologies in railway safety. The effectiveness of the proposed method is
demonstrated through a comprehensive evaluation, yielding a remarkable
improvement in accuracy over existing methods. These results underscore the
potential of this approach to revolutionize safety measures in railway

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着扩散模型生成的图像越来越逼真，开发通用检测器以区分生成图像与真实图像变得至关重要。

Method: LATTE通过建模潜在嵌入在多个去噪步骤中的轨迹，结合潜在-视觉特征细化模块和轻量级分类器，实现检测。

Result: LATTE在GenImage和DiffusionFake等基准测试中表现优异，并在跨生成器和跨数据集场景中展现出强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LATTE证明了潜在轨迹嵌入在生成图像检测中的潜力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of diffusion-based image generators has made it
increasingly difficult to distinguish generated from real images. This can
erode trust in digital media, making it critical to develop generalizable
detectors for generated images. Recent methods leverage diffusion denoising
cues, but mainly focus on single-step reconstruction errors, ignoring the
inherent sequential nature of the denoising process. In this work, we propose
LATTE - Latent Trajectory Embedding - a novel approach that models the
evolution of latent embeddings across several denoising timesteps. By modeling
the trajectory of such embeddings rather than single-step errors, LATTE
captures subtle, discriminative patterns that distinguish real from generated
images. Each latent is refined by employing our latent-visual feature
refinement module and aggregated into a unified representation. Afterwards, it
is fused with the visual features and finally passed into a lightweight
classifier. Our experiments demonstrate that LATTE surpasses the baselines on
several established benchmarks, such as GenImage and DiffusionFake. Moreover,
it demonstrates strong performance in cross-generator and cross-datasets
settings, highlighting the potential of using the trajectory of latent
embeddings for generated image detection. The code is available on the

*Xiangrui Liu,Man Luo,Agneet Chatterjee,Hua Wei,Yezhou Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种心理学分类法，用于分析视觉语言模型（VLMs）的幻觉行为，并设计了一个可扩展的基准测试AIpsych，揭示了模型响应模式中的心理倾向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通常将幻觉归因于技术限制或奉承偏差，而忽略了其可能反映人类心理学中的认知偏差。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过设计AIpsych基准测试，系统分析了模型架构和参数大小对响应行为的影响，并进行了人类受试者研究以验证假设。

Result: 实验表明，随着模型规模增大，VLMs表现出更强的奉承倾向但权威偏差减少，暗示能力提升但可能损害响应完整性。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解VLMs幻觉提供了新视角，并强调了将心理学原则融入模型评估的重要性。

Abstract: Hallucination is a long-standing problem that has been actively investigated
in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Existing research commonly attributes
hallucinations to technical limitations or sycophancy bias, where the latter
means the models tend to generate incorrect answers to align with user
expectations. However, these explanations primarily focus on technical or
externally driven factors, may have neglected the possibility that
hallucination behaviours might mirror cognitive biases observed in human
psychology. In this work, we introduce a psychological taxonomy, categorizing
VLMs' hallucination behaviours, including sycophancy, logical inconsistency,
and a newly identified VLMs behaviour: authority bias. To systematically
analyze these behaviours, we design AIpsych, a scalable benchmark that reveals
psychological tendencies in model response patterns. Leveraging this benchmark,
we investigate how variations in model architecture and parameter size
influence model behaviour when responding to strategically manipulated
questions. Our experiments reveal that as model size increases, VLMs exhibit
stronger sycophantic tendencies but reduced authority bias, suggesting
increasing competence but a potential erosion of response integrity. A human
subject study further validates our hypotheses and highlights key behavioural
differences between VLMs and human respondents. This work suggests a new
perspective for understanding hallucination in VLMs and highlights the
importance of integrating psychological principles into model evaluation.The
benchmark is available at https://github.com/lxrswdd/AIpsych.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了可解释提升机（EBM）在大气科学中的应用，结合特征工程开发可解释的机器学习算法，用于卫星图像中的超顶检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EBM在高风险应用中具有优势，但在大气科学中尚未广泛应用。本文旨在开发可解释的机器学习算法，用于气象应用。

Method: 通过数学方法提取关键特征（如云纹理），应用EBM进行分类任务，并结合领域专家的策略优化模型。

Result: 最终模型虽未达到复杂方法的精度，但表现良好，为可解释机器学习算法的发展提供了重要进展。

Conclusion: EBM结合特征工程和领域知识，为气象应用开发了可解释的机器学习算法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: An Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM) is an interpretable machine learning
(ML) algorithm that has benefits in high risk applications but has not yet
found much use in atmospheric science. The overall goal of this work is
twofold: (1) explore the use of EBMs, in combination with feature engineering,
to obtain interpretable, physics-based machine learning algorithms for
meteorological applications; (2) illustrate these methods for the detection of
overshooting top (OTs) in satellite imagery.
  Specifically, we seek to simplify the process of OT detection by first using
mathematical methods to extract key features, such as cloud texture using
Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrices, followed by applying an EBM. Our EBM focuses
on the classification task of predicting OT regions, utilizing Channel 2
(visible imagery) and Channel 13 (infrared imagery) of the Advanced Baseline
Imager sensor of the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite 16.
Multi-Radar/Multi-Sensor system convection flags are used as labels to train
the EBM model. Note, however, that detecting convection, while related, is
different from detecting OTs.
  Once trained, the EBM was examined and minimally altered to more closely
match strategies used by domain scientists to identify OTs. The result of our
efforts is a fully interpretable ML algorithm that was developed in a
human-machine collaboration. While the final model does not reach the accuracy
of more complex approaches, it performs well and represents a significant step
toward building fully interpretable ML algorithms for this and other
meteorological applications.

Motivation: 大豆猝死综合征（SDS）对大豆生产构成重大威胁，需要早期检测方法以防止产量损失。

Method: 利用高光谱成像（398-1011 nm）和遗传算法选择关键波长，结合CNN提取特征，再通过十种机器学习模型分类。

Abstract: Sudden Death Syndrome (SDS), caused by Fusarium virguliforme, poses a
significant threat to soybean production. This study presents an AI-driven web
application for early detection of SDS on soybean leaves using hyperspectral
imaging, enabling diagnosis prior to visible symptom onset. Leaf samples from
healthy and inoculated plants were scanned using a portable hyperspectral
imaging system (398-1011 nm), and a Genetic Algorithm was employed to select
five informative wavelengths (505.4, 563.7, 712.2, 812.9, and 908.4 nm)
critical for discriminating infection status. These selected bands were fed
into a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract
spatial-spectral features, which were subsequently classified using ten
classical machine learning models. Ensemble classifiers (Random Forest,
AdaBoost), Linear SVM, and Neural Net achieved the highest accuracy (>98%) and
minimal error across all folds, as confirmed by confusion matrices and
cross-validation metrics. Poor performance by Gaussian Process and QDA
highlighted their unsuitability for this dataset. The trained models were
deployed within a web application that enables users to upload hyperspectral
leaf images, visualize spectral profiles, and receive real-time classification
results. This system supports rapid and accessible plant disease diagnostics,
contributing to precision agriculture practices. Future work will expand the
training dataset to encompass diverse genotypes, field conditions, and disease
stages, and will extend the system for multiclass disease classification and
broader crop applicability.

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升农业产量和食品安全，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Like many countries, Nigeria is naturally endowed with fertile agricultural
soil that supports large-scale tomato production. However, the prevalence of
disease causing pathogens poses a significant threat to tomato health, often
leading to reduced yields and, in severe cases, the extinction of certain
species. These diseases jeopardise both the quality and quantity of tomato
harvests, contributing to food insecurity. Fortunately, tomato diseases can
often be visually identified through distinct forms, appearances, or textures,
typically first visible on leaves and fruits. This study presents an enhanced
Capsule-YOLO network architecture designed to automatically segment overlapping
and occluded tomato leaf images from complex backgrounds using the YOLO
framework. It identifies disease symptoms with impressive performance metrics:
99.31% accuracy, 98.78% recall, and 99.09% precision, and a 98.93% F1-score
representing improvements of 2.91%, 1.84%, 5.64%, and 4.12% over existing
state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, a user-friendly interface was developed
to allow farmers and users to upload images of affected tomato plants and
detect early disease symptoms. The system also provides recommendations for
appropriate diagnosis and treatment. The effectiveness of this approach
promises significant benefits for the agricultural sector by enhancing crop
yields and strengthening food security.

Motivation: 研究目的是简化刚体旋转的计算，仅需跟踪一个特征点即可解析求解旋转速率，同时实现场景分割。

Method: 基于正交投影和相机固定条件，通过跟踪一个特征点解析计算刚体旋转速率，并利用旋转速率差异实现场景分割。

Result: 仿真和真实视频数据验证了方法的有效性，能够准确计算旋转速率并区分不同刚体。

Conclusion: 该方法无需先验知识，适用于并行处理，能高效计算刚体旋转并实现场景分割。

Abstract: We demonstrate that, under orthographic projection and with a camera fixated
on a point located on a rigid body, the rotation of that body can be
analytically obtained by tracking only one other feature in the image. With
some exceptions, any tracked point, regardless of its location on the body,
yields the same value of the instantaneous rotation rate.
  The proposed method is independent of the shape of the 3D object and does not
require a priori knowledge about the scene. This algorithm is suited for
parallel processing and can achieve segmentation of the scene by distinguishing
points that do not belong to the same rigid body, simply because they do not
produce the same value of the rotation. This paper presents an analytical
derivation, simulation results, and results from real video data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SICL的损失函数，通过抑制特定于主体的特征，提升对比学习在人类活动识别中的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于数据标注成本高，自监督学习方法（如对比学习）在人类活动识别（HAR）中具有吸引力。然而，主体间的领域偏移导致模型难以泛化到新主体。

Method: 提出Subject-Invariant Contrastive Learning (SICL)，通过重新加权来自同一主体的负样本对，抑制主体特异性特征，突出活动特异性信息。

Result: 在UTD-MHAD、MMAct和DARai三个公开基准上，SICL比传统对比学习方法性能提升高达11%。

Conclusion: SICL是一种简单有效的损失函数，可提升HAR模型的泛化能力，并适用于多种自监督和监督学习场景。

Abstract: The high cost of annotating data makes self-supervised approaches, such as
contrastive learning methods, appealing for Human Activity Recognition (HAR).
Effective contrastive learning relies on selecting informative positive and
negative samples. However, HAR sensor signals are subject to significant domain
shifts caused by subject variability. These domain shifts hinder model
generalization to unseen subjects by embedding subject-specific variations
rather than activity-specific features. As a result, human activity recognition
models trained with contrastive learning often struggle to generalize to new
subjects. We introduce Subject-Invariant Contrastive Learning (SICL), a simple
yet effective loss function to improve generalization in human activity
recognition. SICL re-weights negative pairs drawn from the same subject to
suppress subject-specific cues and emphasize activity-specific information. We
evaluate our loss function on three public benchmarks: UTD-MHAD, MMAct, and
DARai. We show that SICL improves performance by up to 11% over traditional
contrastive learning methods. Additionally, we demonstrate the adaptability of
our loss function across various settings, including multiple self-supervised
methods, multimodal scenarios, and supervised learning frameworks.

Motivation: 路面抗滑性对道路安全至关重要，需要一种低成本且易于测量的方法。

Method: 使用数字图像测量路面摩擦，提出集料突出面积作为指标，并通过统计模型验证。

Result: 调整后的R平方值均高于0.90，比其他图像指标更准确反映摩擦变化。

Conclusion: 该图像指标成本低且有效，适用于混合料设计阶段的路面摩擦评估。

Abstract: Pavement skid resistance is of vital importance for road safety. The
objective of this study is to propose and validate a texture-based image
indicator to predict pavement friction. This index enables pavement friction to
be measured easily and inexpensively using digital images. Three different
types of asphalt surfaces (dense-graded asphalt mix, open-grade friction
course, and chip seal) were evaluated subject to various tire polishing cycles.
Images were taken with corresponding friction measured using Dynamic Friction
Tester (DFT) in the laboratory. The aggregate protrusion area is proposed as
the indicator. Statistical models are established for each asphalt surface type
to correlate the proposed indicator with friction coefficients. The results
show that the adjusted R-square values of all relationships are above 0.90.
Compared to other image-based indicators in the literature, the proposed image
indicator more accurately reflects the changes in pavement friction with the
number of polishing cycles, proving its cost-effective use for considering
pavement friction in mix design stage.

Conclusion: 该方法丰富了图像生成的应用场景，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Existing generative approaches for guided image synthesis of multi-object
scenes typically rely on 2D controls in the image or text space. As a result,
these methods struggle to maintain and respect consistent three-dimensional
geometric structure, underlying the scene. In this paper, we propose a novel
conditioning approach, training method and adapter network that can be plugged
into pretrained text-to-image diffusion models. Our approach provides a way to
endow such models with 3D-awareness, while leveraging their rich prior
knowledge. Our method supports camera control, conditioning on explicit 3D
geometries and, for the first time, accounts for the entire context of a scene,
i.e., both on and off-screen items, to synthesize plausible and semantically
rich images. Despite its multi-modal nature, our model is lightweight, requires
a reasonable number of data for supervised learning and shows remarkable
generalization power. We also introduce methods for intuitive and consistent
image editing and restyling, e.g., by positioning, rotating or resizing
individual objects in a scene. Our method integrates well within various image
creation workflows and enables a richer set of applications compared to
previous approaches.

Motivation: 多视觉编码器旨在增强视觉理解能力，但实际效果可能因冗余而下降，需系统研究此现象。

Method: 通过消融实验分析多编码器MLLMs，提出Conditional Utilization Rate (CUR)和Information Gap (IG)指标量化编码器贡献。

Result: 实验证实部分视觉编码器对性能贡献极小甚至负面，表明冗余现象普遍存在。

Conclusion: 当前多编码器设计存在低效问题，提出的指标可作为优化多模态架构的诊断工具。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) increasingly adopt multiple vision
encoders to capture diverse visual information, ranging from coarse semantics
to fine grained details. While this approach is intended to enhance visual
understanding capability, we observe that the performance gains from adding
encoders often diminish and can even lead to performance degradation, a
phenomenon we term encoder redundancy. This paper presents a systematic
investigation into this issue. Through comprehensive ablation studies on state
of the art multi encoder MLLMs, we empirically demonstrate that significant
redundancy exists. To quantify each encoder's unique contribution, we propose a
principled metric: the Conditional Utilization Rate (CUR). Building on CUR, we
introduce the Information Gap (IG) to capture the overall disparity in encoder
utility within a model.Our experiments reveal that certain vision encoders
contribute little, or even negatively, to overall performance, confirming
substantial redundancy. Our experiments reveal that certain vision encoders
contribute minimally, or even negatively, to the model's performance,
confirming the prevalence of redundancy. These findings highlight critical
inefficiencies in current multi encoder designs and establish that our proposed
metrics can serve as valuable diagnostic tools for developing more efficient
and effective multimodal architectures.

Motivation: 现有文本到视频生成模型通常仅能离线生成短视频，限制了其在交互和实时应用中的使用。

Result: 训练后的模型在单GPU上实现16 FPS的实时性能，生成512p分辨率的视频流。

Conclusion: StreamDiT为实时视频生成应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, great progress has been achieved in text-to-video (T2V) generation
by scaling transformer-based diffusion models to billions of parameters, which
can generate high-quality videos. However, existing models typically produce
only short clips offline, restricting their use cases in interactive and
real-time applications. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing
StreamDiT, a streaming video generation model. StreamDiT training is based on
flow matching by adding a moving buffer. We design mixed training with
different partitioning schemes of buffered frames to boost both content
consistency and visual quality. StreamDiT modeling is based on adaLN DiT with
varying time embedding and window attention. To practice the proposed method,
we train a StreamDiT model with 4B parameters. In addition, we propose a
multistep distillation method tailored for StreamDiT. Sampling distillation is
performed in each segment of a chosen partitioning scheme. After distillation,
the total number of function evaluations (NFEs) is reduced to the number of
chunks in a buffer. Finally, our distilled model reaches real-time performance
at 16 FPS on one GPU, which can generate video streams at 512p resolution. We
evaluate our method through both quantitative metrics and human evaluation. Our
model enables real-time applications, e.g. streaming generation, interactive
generation, and video-to-video. We provide video results and more examples in

Result: 在四个实测双频PolSAR数据集上的实验表明，SKDNet-SSR优于其他相关方法。

Conclusion: SKDNet-SSR有效解决了双频PolSAR图像分类中的关键问题，提升了分类性能。

Abstract: The collaborative classification of dual-frequency PolSAR images is a
meaningful but also challenging research. The effect of regional consistency on
classification information learning and the rational use of dual-frequency data
are two main difficulties for dual-frequency collaborative classification. To
tackle these problems, a selected knowledge distillation network with
statistical-based sample rectification (SKDNet-SSR) is proposed in this
article. First, in addition to applying CNN and ViT as local and global feature
extractors, a statistical-based dynamic sample rectification (SDSR) module is
designed to avoid the impact of poor regional consistency on spatial
information learning process. Specifically, based on the fact that the PolSAR
covariance matrix conforms to the complex Wishart distribution, SDSR first
dynamically evaluates the sample purity, and then performs pixel selection and
pixel generation to remove noisy pixels, thereby avoiding the feature
interaction between informative pixels and noisy pixels and improving the
classification feature extraction process. Next, a dual-frequency gate-selected
distillation (DGSD) module is constructed to emphasize the advantages of
different frequency bands and perform complementary learning on dual-frequency
data. It uses the dominant single-frequency branch on each sample as teacher
model to train the dual-frequency student model, enabling the student model to
learn the optimal results and realizing complementary utilization of
dual-frequency data on different terrain objects. Comprehensive experiments on
four measured dual-frequency PolSAR data demonstrate that the proposed
SKDNet-SSR outperforms other related methods.

Abstract: Birds' Eye View (BEV) semantic segmentation is an indispensable perception
task in end-to-end autonomous driving systems. Unsupervised and semi-supervised
learning for BEV tasks, as pivotal for real-world applications, underperform
due to the homogeneous distribution of the labeled data. In this work, we
explore the potential of synthetic data from driving world models to enhance
the diversity of labeled data for robustifying BEV segmentation. Yet, our
preliminary findings reveal that generation noise in synthetic data compromises
efficient BEV model learning. To fully harness the potential of synthetic data
from world models, this paper proposes NRSeg, a noise-resilient learning
framework for BEV semantic segmentation. Specifically, a Perspective-Geometry
Consistency Metric (PGCM) is proposed to quantitatively evaluate the guidance
capability of generated data for model learning. This metric originates from
the alignment measure between the perspective road mask of generated data and
the mask projected from the BEV labels. Moreover, a Bi-Distribution Parallel
Prediction (BiDPP) is designed to enhance the inherent robustness of the model,
where the learning process is constrained through parallel prediction of
multinomial and Dirichlet distributions. The former efficiently predicts
semantic probabilities, whereas the latter adopts evidential deep learning to
realize uncertainty quantification. Furthermore, a Hierarchical Local Semantic
Exclusion (HLSE) module is designed to address the non-mutual exclusivity
inherent in BEV semantic segmentation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate
that NRSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding the highest
improvements in mIoU of 13.8% and 11.4% in unsupervised and semi-supervised BEV
segmentation tasks, respectively. The source code will be made publicly

Motivation: 现有文本到图像（T2I）基准测试使用固定提示词，可能导致低估模型真实生成能力，并引入模型间的评估偏差。

Method: 基于ConceptMix，引入多模态优化流程，利用视觉语言模型反馈系统优化提示词。

Conclusion: 固定基准测试可能低估模型能力，而ConceptMix++提供了更准确的评估方法，为未来研究提供新视角。

Abstract: Current text-to-image (T2I) benchmarks evaluate models on rigid prompts,
potentially underestimating true generative capabilities due to prompt
sensitivity and creating biases that favor certain models while disadvantaging
others. We introduce ConceptMix++, a framework that disentangles prompt
phrasing from visual generation capabilities by applying iterative prompt
optimization. Building on ConceptMix, our approach incorporates a multimodal
optimization pipeline that leverages vision-language model feedback to refine
prompts systematically. Through extensive experiments across multiple diffusion
models, we show that optimized prompts significantly improve compositional
generation performance, revealing previously hidden model capabilities and
enabling fairer comparisons across T2I models. Our analysis reveals that
certain visual concepts -- such as spatial relationships and shapes -- benefit
more from optimization than others, suggesting that existing benchmarks
systematically underestimate model performance in these categories.
Additionally, we find strong cross-model transferability of optimized prompts,
indicating shared preferences for effective prompt phrasing across models.
These findings demonstrate that rigid benchmarking approaches may significantly
underrepresent true model capabilities, while our framework provides more
accurate assessment and insights for future development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着像素尺寸缩小，图像质量因光积累减少而下降，需解决分辨率、噪声和动态范围之间的权衡问题。

Method: 采用空间变化的增益和像素合并策略，根据局部场景亮度调整增益和合并大小，提升信噪比和动态范围。

Result: 动态范围扩展了一个数量级，数字合并在高增益下优于模拟合并，整体信噪比显著提升。

Conclusion: 结合空间变化增益和像素合并技术，可有效优化图像质量，适用于高动态范围成像等应用。

Abstract: Pixels in image sensors have progressively become smaller, driven by the goal
of producing higher-resolution imagery. However, ceteris paribus, a smaller
pixel accumulates less light, making image quality worse. This interplay of
resolution, noise, and the dynamic range of the sensor and their impact on the
eventual quality of acquired imagery is a fundamental concept in photography.
In this paper, we propose spatially-varying gain and binning to enhance the
noise performance and dynamic range of image sensors. First, we show that by
varying gain spatially to local scene brightness, the read noise can be made
negligible, and the dynamic range of a sensor is expanded by an order of
magnitude. Second, we propose a simple analysis to find a binning size that
best balances resolution and noise for a given light level; this analysis
predicts a spatially-varying binning strategy, again based on local scene
brightness, to effectively increase the overall signal-to-noise ratio. %
without sacrificing resolution. We discuss analog and digital binning modes
and, perhaps surprisingly, show that digital binning outperforms its analog
counterparts when a larger gain is allowed. Finally, we demonstrate that
combining spatially-varying gain and binning in various applications, including
high dynamic range imaging, vignetting, and lens distortion.

Motivation: 现有机器遗忘方法依赖微调，成本高且可能导致性能下降，亟需一种高效且无需微调的解决方案。

Method: 在训练过程中随机划分小批量数据为遗忘集和保留集，通过撤销密钥实现即时遗忘，同时联合训练可学习密钥和原始权重。

Result: 在多种数据集、架构和分辨率上验证了{\pname}优于现有方法，且避免了性能下降。

Conclusion: {\pname}提供了一种高效、无需微调的机器遗忘方法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MUL) refers to the problem of making a pre-trained model
selectively forget some training instances or class(es) while retaining
performance on the remaining dataset. Existing MUL research involves
fine-tuning using a forget and/or retain set, making it expensive and/or
impractical, and often causing performance degradation in the unlearned model.
We introduce {\pname}, an unlearning-aware vision transformer-based
architecture that can directly perform unlearning for future unlearning
requests without any fine-tuning over the requested set. The proposed model is
trained by simulating unlearning during the training process itself. It
involves randomly separating class(es)/sub-class(es) present in each mini-batch
into two disjoint sets: a proxy forget-set and a retain-set, and the model is
optimized so that it is unable to predict the forget-set. Forgetting is
achieved by withdrawing keys, making unlearning on-the-fly and avoiding
performance degradation. The model is trained jointly with learnable keys and
original weights, ensuring withholding a key irreversibly erases information,
validated by membership inference attack scores. Extensive experiments on
various datasets, architectures, and resolutions confirm {\pname}'s superiority
over both fine-tuning-free and fine-tuning-based methods.

Conclusion: MolVision展示了多模态表示在分子属性预测中的潜力，视觉信息与文本结合是未来研究方向。

Abstract: Molecular property prediction is a fundamental task in computational
chemistry with critical applications in drug discovery and materials science.
While recent works have explored Large Language Models (LLMs) for this task,
they primarily rely on textual molecular representations such as
SMILES/SELFIES, which can be ambiguous and structurally less informative. In
this work, we introduce MolVision, a novel approach that leverages
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by integrating both molecular structure as images
and textual descriptions to enhance property prediction. We construct a
benchmark spanning ten diverse datasets, covering classification, regression
and description tasks. Evaluating nine different VLMs in zero-shot, few-shot,
and fine-tuned settings, we find that visual information improves prediction
performance, particularly when combined with efficient fine-tuning strategies
such as LoRA. Our results reveal that while visual information alone is
insufficient, multimodal fusion significantly enhances generalization across
molecular properties. Adaptation of vision encoder for molecular images in
conjunction with LoRA further improves the performance. The code and data is

Motivation: 传统基于姿态的自动化GMA方法因数据质量低和姿态估计噪声导致不确定性高，缺乏可靠的临床可靠性。

Method: UDF-GMA直接建模数据噪声的随机不确定性，并通过贝叶斯近似估计认知不确定性，进一步融合运动表示以增强分类分离。

Result: 在Pmi-GMA基准数据集上的实验表明，UDF-GMA在预测不良运动模式方面具有有效性和泛化性。

Conclusion: UDF-GMA通过分离和融合不确定性，显著提升了自动化GMA的可靠性和临床适用性。

Abstract: General movement assessment (GMA) is a non-invasive tool for the early
detection of brain dysfunction through the qualitative assessment of general
movements, and the development of automated methods can broaden its
application. However, mainstream pose-based automated GMA methods are prone to
uncertainty due to limited high-quality data and noisy pose estimation,
hindering clinical reliability without reliable uncertainty measures. In this
work, we introduce UDF-GMA which explicitly models epistemic uncertainty in
model parameters and aleatoric uncertainty from data noise for pose-based
automated GMA. UDF-GMA effectively disentangles uncertainties by directly
modelling aleatoric uncertainty and estimating epistemic uncertainty through
Bayesian approximation. We further propose fusing these uncertainties with the
embedded motion representation to enhance class separation. Extensive
experiments on the Pmi-GMA benchmark dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalisability of the proposed approach in predicting poor repertoire.

Conclusion: 该方法在无需标注的情况下实现了泛化能力，并在多个数据集上达到SOTA性能。

Abstract: One practical approach to infer 3D scene structure from a single image is to
retrieve a closely matching 3D model from a database and align it with the
object in the image. Existing methods rely on supervised training with images
and pose annotations, which limits them to a narrow set of object categories.
To address this, we propose a weakly supervised 9-DoF alignment method for
inexact 3D models that requires no pose annotations and generalizes to unseen
categories. Our approach derives a novel feature space based on foundation
features that ensure multi-view consistency and overcome symmetry ambiguities
inherent in foundation features using a self-supervised triplet loss.
Additionally, we introduce a texture-invariant pose refinement technique that
performs dense alignment in normalized object coordinates, estimated through
the enhanced feature space. We conduct extensive evaluations on the real-world
ScanNet25k dataset, where our method outperforms SOTA weakly supervised
baselines by +4.3% mean alignment accuracy and is the only weakly supervised
approach to surpass the supervised ROCA by +2.7%. To assess generalization, we
introduce SUN2CAD, a real-world test set with 20 novel object categories, where
our method achieves SOTA results without prior training on them.

Conclusion: 扩散生成范式在手术阶段识别中有效，CPKD为临床实践提供了新工具。

Abstract: Gastrointestinal malignancies constitute a leading cause of cancer-related
mortality worldwide, with advanced-stage prognosis remaining particularly
dismal. Originating as a groundbreaking technique for early gastric cancer
treatment, Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection has evolved into a versatile
intervention for diverse gastrointestinal lesions. While computer-assisted
systems significantly enhance procedural precision and safety in ESD, their
clinical adoption faces a critical bottleneck: reliable surgical phase
recognition within complex endoscopic workflows. Current state-of-the-art
approaches predominantly rely on multi-stage refinement architectures that
iteratively optimize temporal predictions. In this paper, we present Clinical
Prior Knowledge-Constrained Diffusion (CPKD), a novel generative framework that
reimagines phase recognition through denoising diffusion principles while
preserving the core iterative refinement philosophy. This architecture
progressively reconstructs phase sequences starting from random noise and
conditioned on visual-temporal features. To better capture three
domain-specific characteristics, including positional priors, boundary
ambiguity, and relation dependency, we design a conditional masking strategy.
Furthermore, we incorporate clinical prior knowledge into the model training to
improve its ability to correct phase logical errors. Comprehensive evaluations
on ESD820, Cholec80, and external multi-center demonstrate that our proposed
CPKD achieves superior or comparable performance to state-of-the-art
approaches, validating the effectiveness of diffusion-based generative
paradigms for surgical phase recognition.

Conclusion: SemiOVS有效利用了未标记的OOD图像，为半监督语义分割任务提供了新思路，并有望推动未来研究和实际应用。

Abstract: In semi-supervised semantic segmentation, existing studies have shown
promising results in academic settings with controlled splits of benchmark
datasets. However, the potential benefits of leveraging significantly larger
sets of unlabeled images remain unexplored. In real-world scenarios, abundant
unlabeled images are often available from online sources (web-scraped images)
or large-scale datasets. However, these images may have different distributions
from those of the target dataset, a situation known as out-of-distribution
(OOD). Using these images as unlabeled data in semi-supervised learning can
lead to inaccurate pseudo-labels, potentially misguiding network training. In
this paper, we propose a new semi-supervised semantic segmentation framework
with an open-vocabulary segmentation model (SemiOVS) to effectively utilize
unlabeled OOD images. Extensive experiments on Pascal VOC and Context datasets
demonstrate two key findings: (1) using additional unlabeled images improves
the performance of semi-supervised learners in scenarios with few labels, and
(2) using the open-vocabulary segmentation (OVS) model to pseudo-label OOD
images leads to substantial performance gains. In particular, SemiOVS
outperforms existing PrevMatch and SemiVL methods by +3.5 and +3.0 mIoU,
respectively, on Pascal VOC with a 92-label setting, achieving state-of-the-art
performance. These findings demonstrate that our approach effectively utilizes
abundant unlabeled OOD images for semantic segmentation tasks. We hope this
work can inspire future research and real-world applications. The code is

Result: 在EPIC-Kitchens和Human-Animal-Cartoon等基准数据集上验证了方法的有效性和优越性。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了多模态领域泛化能力，为多模态任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) aims to enhance model robustness in unseen or
distributionally shifted target domains through training exclusively on source
domains. Although existing DG techniques, such as data manipulation, learning
strategies, and representation learning, have shown significant progress, they
predominantly address single-modal data. With the emergence of numerous
multi-modal datasets and increasing demand for multi-modal tasks, a key
challenge in Multi-modal Domain Generalization (MMDG) has emerged: enabling
models trained on multi-modal sources to generalize to unseen target
distributions within the same modality set. Due to the inherent differences
between modalities, directly transferring methods from single-modal DG to MMDG
typically yields sub-optimal results. These methods often exhibit randomness
during generalization due to the invisibility of target domains and fail to
consider inter-modal consistency. Applying these methods independently to each
modality in the MMDG setting before combining them can lead to divergent
generalization directions across different modalities, resulting in degraded
generalization capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
approach that leverages Unified Representations to map different paired
modalities together, effectively adapting DG methods to MMDG by enabling
synchronized multi-modal improvements within the unified space. Additionally,
we introduce a supervised disentanglement framework that separates
modal-general and modal-specific information, further enhancing the alignment
of unified representations. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets,
including EPIC-Kitchens and Human-Animal-Cartoon, demonstrate the effectiveness
and superiority of our method in enhancing multi-modal domain generalization.

Abstract: Multi-camera systems are increasingly vital in the environmental perception
of autonomous vehicles and robotics. Their physical configuration offers
inherent fixed relative pose constraints that benefit Structure-from-Motion
(SfM). However, traditional global SfM systems struggle with robustness due to
their optimization framework. We propose a novel global motion averaging
framework for multi-camera systems, featuring two core components: a decoupled
rotation averaging module and a hybrid translation averaging module. Our
rotation averaging employs a hierarchical strategy by first estimating relative
rotations within rigid camera units and then computing global rigid unit
rotations. To enhance the robustness of translation averaging, we incorporate
both camera-to-camera and camera-to-point constraints to initialize camera
positions and 3D points with a convex distance-based objective function and
refine them with an unbiased non-bilinear angle-based objective function.
Experiments on large-scale datasets show that our system matches or exceeds
incremental SfM accuracy while significantly improving efficiency. Our
framework outperforms existing global SfM methods, establishing itself as a
robust solution for real-world multi-camera SfM applications. The code is
available at https://github.com/3dv-casia/MGSfM/.

Abstract: Translating nuanced, textually-defined authorial writing styles into
compelling visual representations presents a novel challenge in generative AI.
This paper introduces a pipeline that leverages Author Writing Sheets (AWS) -
structured summaries of an author's literary characteristics - as input to a
Large Language Model (LLM, Claude 3.7 Sonnet). The LLM interprets the AWS to
generate three distinct, descriptive text-to-image prompts, which are then
rendered by a diffusion model (Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium). We evaluated our
approach using 49 author styles from Reddit data, with human evaluators
assessing the stylistic match and visual distinctiveness of the generated
images. Results indicate a good perceived alignment between the generated
visuals and the textual authorial profiles (mean style match: $4.08/5$), with
images rated as moderately distinctive. Qualitative analysis further
highlighted the pipeline's ability to capture mood and atmosphere, while also
identifying challenges in representing highly abstract narrative elements. This
work contributes a novel end-to-end methodology for visual authorial style
personalization and provides an initial empirical validation, opening avenues
for applications in creative assistance and cross-modal understanding.

Abstract: Domain adaptation has become a widely adopted approach in machine learning
due to the high costs associated with labeling data. It is typically applied
when access to a labeled source domain is available. However, in real-world
scenarios, privacy concerns often restrict access to sensitive information,
such as fingerprints, bank account details, and facial images. A promising
solution to this issue is Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SFUDA),
which enables domain adaptation without requiring access to labeled target
domain data. Recent research demonstrates that SFUDA can effectively address
domain discrepancies; however, two key challenges remain: (1) the low quality
of prototype samples, and (2) the incorrect assignment of pseudo-labels. To
tackle these challenges, we propose a method consisting of three main phases.
In the first phase, we introduce a Reliable Sample Memory (RSM) module to
improve the quality of prototypes by selecting more representative samples. In
the second phase, we employ a Multi-View Contrastive Learning (MVCL) approach
to enhance pseudo-label quality by leveraging multiple data augmentations. In
the final phase, we apply a noisy label filtering technique to further refine
the pseudo-labels. Our experiments on three benchmark datasets - VisDA 2017,
Office-Home, and Office-31 - demonstrate that our method achieves approximately
2 percent and 6 percent improvements in classification accuracy over the
second-best method and the average of 13 well-known state-of-the-art
approaches, respectively.

Abstract: Recent generative models such as GPT-4o have shown strong capabilities in

design tasks like advertising banners demand more than visual fidelity -- they
require structured layouts, precise typography, consistent branding, and more.
In this paper, we introduce MIMO (Mirror In-the-Model), an agentic refinement
framework for automatic ad banner generation. MIMO combines a hierarchical
multi-modal agent system (MIMO-Core) with a coordination loop (MIMO-Loop) that
explores multiple stylistic directions and iteratively improves design quality.
Requiring only a simple natural language based prompt and logo image as input,
MIMO automatically detects and corrects multiple types of errors during
generation. Experiments show that MIMO significantly outperforms existing
diffusion and LLM-based baselines in real-world banner design scenarios.

Abstract: To alleviate the reliance of deep neural networks on large-scale datasets,
dataset distillation aims to generate compact, high-quality synthetic datasets
that can achieve comparable performance to the original dataset. The
integration of generative models has significantly advanced this field.
However, existing approaches primarily focus on aligning the distilled dataset
with the original one, often overlooking task-specific information that can be
critical for optimal downstream performance. In this paper, focusing on the
downstream task of classification, we propose a task-specific sampling strategy
for generative dataset distillation that incorporates the concept of difficulty
to consider the requirements of the target task better. The final dataset is
sampled from a larger image pool with a sampling distribution obtained by
matching the difficulty distribution of the original dataset. A logarithmic
transformation is applied as a pre-processing step to correct for
distributional bias. The results of extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method and suggest its potential for enhancing performance
on other downstream tasks.

Abstract: Detecting deepfakes involving face-swaps presents a significant challenge,
particularly in real-world scenarios where anyone can perform face-swapping
with freely available tools and apps without any technical knowledge. Existing
deepfake detection methods rely on facial landmarks or inconsistencies in
pixel-level features and often struggle with face-swap deepfakes, where the
source face is seamlessly blended into the target image or video. The
prevalence of face-swap is evident in everyday life, where it is used to spread
false information, damage reputations, manipulate political opinions, create
non-consensual intimate deepfakes (NCID), and exploit children by enabling the
creation of child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Even prominent public figures
are not immune to its impact, with numerous deepfakes of them circulating
widely across social media platforms. Another challenge faced by deepfake
detection methods is the creation of datasets that encompass a wide range of
variations, as training models require substantial amounts of data. This raises
privacy concerns, particularly regarding the processing and storage of personal
facial data, which could lead to unauthorized access or misuse. Our key idea is
to identify these style discrepancies to detect face-swapped images effectively
without accessing the real facial image. We perform comprehensive evaluations
using multiple datasets and face-swapping methods, which showcases the
effectiveness of SafeVision in detecting face-swap deepfakes across diverse
scenarios. SafeVision offers a reliable and scalable solution for detecting
face-swaps in a privacy preserving manner, making it particularly effective in
challenging real-world applications. To the best of our knowledge, SafeVision
is the first deepfake detection using style features while providing inherent
privacy protection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DESign框架通过动态上下文感知卷积（DCAC）和子网正则化CTC（SR-CTC）提升连续手语识别（CSLR）性能，解决了现有方法在时空建模和过拟合方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CSLR方法难以处理多样样本，且动态卷积主要关注空间建模，忽略了时间动态和上下文依赖。

Method: 提出DESign框架，结合DCAC动态捕捉帧间运动线索，SR-CTC通过子网监督防止CTC过拟合。

Result: 在主流数据集（PHOENIX14等）上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: DESign通过DCAC和SR-CTC显著提升CSLR性能，且SR-CTC无额外推理开销。

Abstract: Current continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) methods struggle with
handling diverse samples. Although dynamic convolutions are ideal for this
task, they mainly focus on spatial modeling and fail to capture the temporal
dynamics and contextual dependencies. To address this, we propose DESign, a
novel framework that incorporates Dynamic Context-Aware Convolution (DCAC) and
Subnet Regularization Connectionist Temporal Classification (SR-CTC). DCAC
dynamically captures the inter-frame motion cues that constitute signs and
uniquely adapts convolutional weights in a fine-grained manner based on
contextual information, enabling the model to better generalize across diverse
signing behaviors and boost recognition accuracy. Furthermore, we observe that
existing methods still rely on only a limited number of frames for parameter
updates during training, indicating that CTC learning overfits to a dominant
path. To address this, SR-CTC regularizes training by applying supervision to
subnetworks, encouraging the model to explore diverse CTC alignment paths and
effectively preventing overfitting. A classifier-sharing strategy in SR-CTC
further strengthens multi-scale consistency. Notably, SR-CTC introduces no
inference overhead and can be seamlessly integrated into existing CSLR models
to boost performance. Extensive ablations and visualizations further validate
the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Results on mainstream CSLR datasets
(i.e., PHOENIX14, PHOENIX14-T, CSL-Daily) demonstrate that DESign achieves
state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 现有方法过于依赖新架构组件的添加，而忽视了基础设计选择的重要性。作者希望通过优化这些核心组件，提升变化检测的性能。

Method: 系统性地重新审视变化检测模型的设计空间，分析基础设计选择（如主干网络、预训练策略和训练配置）的影响，并优化基线模型。

Conclusion: 基础设计选择的优化对性能提升至关重要，甚至比架构创新更重要。论文为未来方法提供了指导，强调核心组件的优化与架构创新同样重要。

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection aims to localize semantic changes between
images of the same location captured at different times. In the past few years,
newer methods have attributed enhanced performance to the additions of new and
complex components to existing architectures. Most fail to measure the
performance contribution of fundamental design choices such as backbone
selection, pre-training strategies, and training configurations. We claim that
such fundamental design choices often improve performance even more
significantly than the addition of new architectural components. Due to that,
we systematically revisit the design space of change detection models and
analyse the full potential of a well-optimised baseline. We identify a set of
fundamental design choices that benefit both new and existing architectures.
Leveraging this insight, we demonstrate that when carefully designed, even an
architecturally simple model can match or surpass state-of-the-art performance
on six challenging change detection datasets. Our best practices generalise
beyond our architecture and also offer performance improvements when applied to
related methods, indicating that the space of fundamental design choices has
been underexplored. Our guidelines and architecture provide a strong foundation
for future methods, emphasizing that optimizing core components is just as
important as architectural novelty in advancing change detection performance.

Motivation: 现有PCB缺陷检测方法存在特征表示不足、计算冗余和训练数据不足的问题，无法满足工业对精度和效率的需求。

Method: 设计了MRDCB模块增强特征表示，引入ASPN动态筛选和融合特征以减少计算冗余，并构建了一个高质量数据集。

Result: 提出的框架显著提高了检测效率和精度，并填补了公共数据集的空白。

Conclusion: MRC-DETR为PCB缺陷检测提供了高效且准确的解决方案，同时为未来研究提供了宝贵的数据资源。

Abstract: In modern electronic manufacturing, defect detection on Printed Circuit
Boards (PCBs) plays a critical role in ensuring product yield and maintaining
the reliability of downstream assembly processes. However, existing methods
often suffer from limited feature representation, computational redundancy, and
insufficient availability of high-quality training data -- challenges that
hinder their ability to meet industrial demands for both accuracy and
efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose MRC-DETR, a novel and
efficient detection framework tailored for bare PCB defect inspection, built
upon the foundation of RT-DETR. Firstly, to enhance feature representation
capability, we design a Multi-Residual Directional Coupled Block (MRDCB). This
module improves channel-wise feature interaction through a multi-residual
structure. Moreover, a cross-spatial learning strategy is integrated to capture
fine-grained pixel-level relationships, further enriching the representational
power of the extracted features. Secondly, to reduce computational redundancy
caused by inefficient cross-layer information fusion, we introduce an Adaptive
Screening Pyramid Network (ASPN). This component dynamically filters and
aggregates salient low-level features, selectively fusing them with high-level
semantic features. By focusing on informative regions and suppressing redundant
computations, ASPN significantly improves both efficiency and detection
accuracy. Finally, to tackle the issue of insufficient training data,
particularly in the context of bare PCBs, we construct a new, high-quality
dataset that fills a critical gap in current public resources. Our dataset not
only supports the training and evaluation of our proposed framework but also
serves as a valuable benchmark for future research in this domain.

Motivation: 解决教学视频中动作序列生成的挑战，弥补现有方法在捕捉动作间复杂时间关系上的不足。

Method: MTID模型结合潜在空间时间插值模块和动作感知掩码投影机制，增强视觉监督并限制动作生成空间。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上表现优异，生成的动作序列更连贯且任务对齐。

Conclusion: MTID通过改进监督和生成机制，显著提升了动作序列预测的准确性和上下文感知能力。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenge of procedure planning in
instructional videos, aiming to generate coherent and task-aligned action
sequences from start and end visual observations. Previous work has mainly
relied on text-level supervision to bridge the gap between observed states and
unobserved actions, but it struggles with capturing intricate temporal
relationships among actions. Building on these efforts, we propose the Masked
Temporal Interpolation Diffusion (MTID) model that introduces a latent space
temporal interpolation module within the diffusion model. This module leverages
a learnable interpolation matrix to generate intermediate latent features,
thereby augmenting visual supervision with richer mid-state details. By
integrating this enriched supervision into the model, we enable end-to-end
training tailored to task-specific requirements, significantly enhancing the
model's capacity to predict temporally coherent action sequences. Additionally,
we introduce an action-aware mask projection mechanism to restrict the action
generation space, combined with a task-adaptive masked proximity loss to
prioritize more accurate reasoning results close to the given start and end
states over those in intermediate steps. Simultaneously, it filters out
task-irrelevant action predictions, leading to contextually aware action
sequences. Experimental results across three widely used benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our MTID achieves promising action planning performance on
most metrics. The code is available at https://github.com/WiserZhou/MTID.

Abstract: Estimating normals for noisy point clouds is a persistent challenge in 3D
geometry processing, particularly for end-to-end oriented normal estimation.
Existing methods generally address relatively clean data and rely on supervised
priors to fit local surfaces within specific neighborhoods. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach for learning normals from noisy point clouds through
local gradient-aware surface filtering. Our method projects noisy points onto
the underlying surface by utilizing normals and distances derived from an
implicit function constrained by local gradients. We start by introducing a
distance measurement operator for global surface fitting on noisy data, which
integrates projected distances along normals. Following this, we develop an
implicit field-based filtering approach for surface point construction, adding
projection constraints on these points during filtering. To address issues of
over-smoothing and gradient degradation, we further incorporate local gradient
consistency constraints, as well as local gradient orientation and aggregation.
Comprehensive experiments on normal estimation, surface reconstruction, and
point cloud denoising demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our
method. The source code and trained models are available at

Motivation: 现有两阶段流程（掩码生成+扩散编辑）过于关注生成器优化，忽视了掩码可控性，导致用户定义灵活性差和姿态鲁棒性弱的问题。

Method: 提出Pose-Star框架，通过骨骼关键点校准扩散注意力（Star tokens），结合相位感知分析和阈值掩码等技术，生成解剖感知掩码。

Conclusion: 该工作填补了可控基准与开放世界需求之间的空白，为工业时尚图像编辑奠定了基础。

Abstract: To advance real-world fashion image editing, we analyze existing two-stage
pipelines(mask generation followed by diffusion-based editing)which overly
prioritize generator optimization while neglecting mask controllability. This
results in two critical limitations: I) poor user-defined flexibility
(coarse-grained human masks restrict edits to predefined regions like upper
torso; fine-grained clothes masks preserve poses but forbid style/length
customization). II) weak pose robustness (mask generators fail due to
articulated poses and miss rare regions like waist, while human parsers remain
limited by predefined categories). To address these gaps, we propose Pose-Star,
a framework that dynamically recomposes body structures (e.g., neck, chest,
etc.) into anatomy-aware masks (e.g., chest-length) for user-defined edits. In
Pose-Star, we calibrate diffusion-derived attention (Star tokens) via skeletal
keypoints to enhance rare structure localization in complex poses, suppress
noise through phase-aware analysis of attention dynamics
(Convergence,Stabilization,Divergence) with threshold masking and
sliding-window fusion, and refine edges via cross-self attention merging and
Canny alignment. This work bridges controlled benchmarks and open-world
demands, pioneering anatomy-aware, pose-robust editing and laying the
foundation for industrial fashion image editing.

Motivation: 现有防御方法无法应对未知攻击，导致对抗鲁棒性的泛化问题。论文试图通过揭示对抗样本的低熵共性来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出REAL方法：1）基于LE先验修正对抗样本，通过反向最大化预测熵消除对抗性；2）通过正向最小化预测熵确保修正样本正确分类。引入攻击感知权重机制调整优化目标强度。

Result: 实验表明，REAL显著提升了现有样本修正模型的性能。

Conclusion: LE先验为对抗鲁棒性提供了通用指导，REAL方法通过熵优化有效提升了防御能力。

Abstract: Existing defense methods fail to defend against unknown attacks and thus
raise generalization issue of adversarial robustness. To remedy this problem,
we attempt to delve into some underlying common characteristics among various
attacks for generality. In this work, we reveal the commonly overlooked low
entropy prior (LE) implied in various adversarial samples, and shed light on
the universal robustness against unseen attacks in inference phase. LE prior is
elaborated as two properties across various attacks as shown in Fig. 1 and Fig.
2: 1) low entropy misclassification for adversarial samples and 2) lower
entropy prediction for higher attack intensity. This phenomenon stands in stark
contrast to the naturally distributed samples. The LE prior can instruct
existing test-time defense methods, thus we propose a two-stage REAL approach:
Rectify Adversarial sample based on LE prior for test-time adversarial
rectification. Specifically, to align adversarial samples more closely with
clean samples, we propose to first rectify adversarial samples misclassified
with low entropy by reverse maximizing prediction entropy, thereby eliminating
their adversarial nature. To ensure the rectified samples can be correctly
classified with low entropy, we carry out secondary rectification by forward
minimizing prediction entropy, thus creating a Max-Min entropy optimization
scheme. Further, based on the second property, we propose an attack-aware
weighting mechanism to adaptively adjust the strengths of Max-Min entropy
objectives. Experiments on several datasets show that REAL can greatly improve
the performance of existing sample rectification models.

Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型数据需求的增加，数据质量与噪声对应样本的问题日益突出，传统方法难以满足实际需求。

Method: 提出NCU框架，通过学习最难的负样本信息，消除噪声知识，并通过最优传输目标实现快速微调。

Result: 实验表明，NCU在零样本迁移任务中优于现有方法，且计算开销更低。

Conclusion: NCU为提升预训练VLMs的鲁棒性提供了一种高效的新思路。

Abstract: The data appetite for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has continuously scaled
up from the early millions to billions today, which faces an untenable
trade-off with data quality and inevitably introduces Noisy Correspondence (NC)
samples. Undoubtedly, such semantically unrelated data significantly impairs
the performance of VLMs. Previous efforts mainly address this challenge by
estimating refined alignment for more precise guidance. However, such
resource-intensive pipelines that train VLMs from scratch struggle to meet
realistic data demands. In this paper, we present a brand new perspective that
seeks to directly eliminate the harmful effects of NC in pre-trained VLMs.
Specifically, we propose NCU, a Noisy Correspondence Unlearning fine-tuning
framework that efficiently enhances VLMs' robustness by forgetting learned
noisy knowledge. The key to NCU is learning the hardest negative information,
which can provide explicit unlearning direction for both false positives and
false negatives. Such twin goals unlearning process can be formalized into one
unified optimal transport objective for fast fine-tuning. We validate our
approach with the prevailing CLIP model over various downstream tasks.
Remarkably, NCU surpasses the robust pre-trained method on zero-shot transfer
while with lower computational overhead. The code will be released upon
acceptance.

estimation task for vehicles using radar sensing. We address moving instance
tracking in sparse radar point clouds to enhance scene interpretation. We
propose a learning-based radar tracker incorporating temporal offset
predictions to enable direct center-based association and enhance segmentation
performance by including additional motion cues. We implement attention-based
tracking for sparse radar scans to include appearance features and enhance
performance. The final association combines geometric and appearance features
to overcome the limitations of center-based tracking to associate instances
reliably. Our approach shows an improved performance on the moving instance
tracking benchmark of the RadarScenes dataset compared to the current state of
the art.

Conclusion: 该方法简单、有效且即插即用，成功解决了CLIP对全局模式的偏见问题，使其能够同时关注全局和局部特征。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP achieve cross-modal semantic
alignment through contrastive learning, exhibiting robust zero-shot
generalization. Traditional prompt engineering, however, predominantly relies
on coarse-grained category labels, neglecting fine-grained local semantics.
Existing approaches assume that VLMs inherently recognize localized visual
details and attempt to enhance classification by augmenting text prompts with
attribute descriptors generated by large language models. However, our
systematic experiments reveal critical limitations: CLIP's strong bias toward
global image patterns hinders its ability to process localized visual
descriptors. To address this fundamental constraint, we propose a simple,
effective, and plug-and-play solution that enables CLIP to ``See Both the
Forest and the Trees." Specifically, we employ stochastic multi-crop
augmentation to activate CLIP's latent capacity for localized feature analysis.
By cropping only partial regions, the approach effectively constrains the
model's receptive field and recalibrates its attention mechanism, thereby
mitigating its inherent bias. We evaluate the proposed method under zero-shot,
few-shot, and test-time adaptation settings, and extensive experiments
demonstrate that D&D achieves promising performance.

Result: 在RadarScenes数据集上创建了新基准，方法在单次雷达扫描中表现出色，速度快于传感器帧率。

Conclusion: 该方法通过单次雷达扫描实现了高效的移动物体分割，提升了自动驾驶的场景理解能力。

Abstract: The awareness about moving objects in the surroundings of a self-driving
vehicle is essential for safe and reliable autonomous navigation. The
interpretation of LiDAR and camera data achieves exceptional results but
typically requires to accumulate and process temporal sequences of data in
order to extract motion information. In contrast, radar sensors, which are
already installed in most recent vehicles, can overcome this limitation as they
directly provide the Doppler velocity of the detections and, hence incorporate
instantaneous motion information within a single measurement. % In this paper,
we tackle the problem of moving object segmentation in noisy radar point
clouds. We also consider differentiating parked from moving cars, to enhance
scene understanding. Instead of exploiting temporal dependencies to identify
moving objects, we develop a novel transformer-based approach to perform
single-scan moving object segmentation in sparse radar scans accurately. The
key to our Radar Velocity Transformer is to incorporate the valuable velocity
information throughout each module of the network, thereby enabling the precise
segmentation of moving and non-moving objects. Additionally, we propose a
transformer-based upsampling, which enhances the performance by adaptively
combining information and overcoming the limitation of interpolation of sparse
point clouds. Finally, we create a new radar moving object segmentation
benchmark based on the RadarScenes dataset and compare our approach to other
state-of-the-art methods. Our network runs faster than the frame rate of the
sensor and shows superior segmentation results using only single-scan radar
data.

Motivation: 传统二值化方法在变化检测模型中直接量化权重和激活值，导致网络表示能力和区分变化区域的能力受限，检测精度显著降低。

Method: BiCD引入基于信息瓶颈（IB）原则的辅助目标，设计紧凑可学习的辅助模块近似计算互信息，优化策略结合重建损失和标准变化检测损失。

Result: 在街景和遥感数据集上的实验表明，BiCD在BNN变化检测领域达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: BiCD为BNN变化检测设立了新基准，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Binarized Change Detection (BiCD), the first binary
neural network (BNN) designed specifically for change detection. Conventional
network binarization approaches, which directly quantize both weights and
activations in change detection models, severely limit the network's ability to
represent input data and distinguish between changed and unchanged regions.
This results in significantly lower detection accuracy compared to real-valued
networks. To overcome these challenges, BiCD enhances both the representational
power and feature separability of BNNs, improving detection performance.
Specifically, we introduce an auxiliary objective based on the Information
Bottleneck (IB) principle, guiding the encoder to retain essential input
information while promoting better feature discrimination. Since directly
computing mutual information under the IB principle is intractable, we design a
compact, learnable auxiliary module as an approximation target, leading to a
simple yet effective optimization strategy that minimizes both reconstruction
loss and standard change detection loss. Extensive experiments on street-view
and remote sensing datasets demonstrate that BiCD establishes a new benchmark
for BNN-based change detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance in this
domain.

Conclusion: 多模态融合策略在细粒度视频分类任务中表现出色，跨注意力和特征增强是关键因素。

Abstract: Fine-grained video classification requires understanding complex
spatio-temporal and semantic cues that often exceed the capacity of a single
modality. In this paper, we propose a multimodal framework that fuses video,
image, and text representations using GRU-based sequence encoders and
cross-modal attention mechanisms. The model is trained using a combination of
classification or regression loss, depending on the task, and is further
regularized through feature-level augmentation and autoencoding techniques. To
evaluate the generality of our framework, we conduct experiments on two
challenging benchmarks: the DVD dataset for real-world violence detection and
the Aff-Wild2 dataset for valence-arousal estimation. Our results demonstrate
that the proposed fusion strategy significantly outperforms unimodal baselines,
with cross-attention and feature augmentation contributing notably to
robustness and performance.

Result: 现有模型在PhenoCell上的表现（F1分数低至0.20）远低于其他基准（如Lizard和PanNuke），表明任务更具挑战性。

Conclusion: PhenoCell为未来基础模型和监督模型的基准测试提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Digital pathology has seen the advent of a wealth of foundational models
(FM), yet to date their performance on cell phenotyping has not been
benchmarked in a unified manner. We therefore propose PhenoBench: A
comprehensive benchmark for cell phenotyping on Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E)
stained histopathology images. We provide both PhenoCell, a new H&E dataset
featuring 14 granular cell types identified by using multiplexed imaging, and
ready-to-use fine-tuning and benchmarking code that allows the systematic
evaluation of multiple prominent pathology FMs in terms of dense cell phenotype
predictions in different generalization scenarios. We perform extensive
benchmarking of existing FMs, providing insights into their generalization
behavior under technical vs. medical domain shifts. Furthermore, while FMs
achieve macro F1 scores > 0.70 on previously established benchmarks such as
Lizard and PanNuke, on PhenoCell, we observe scores as low as 0.20. This
indicates a much more challenging task not captured by previous benchmarks,
establishing PhenoCell as a prime asset for future benchmarking of FMs and
supervised models alike. Code and data are available on GitHub.

*Elena Bueno-Benito,Mariella Dimiccoli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLOT是一种基于最优传输（OT）的新框架，通过多级循环特征学习机制改进无监督动作分割，解决了ASOT缺乏段级监督的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASOT在无监督动作分割中表现优异，但缺乏段级监督限制了帧与动作表示之间的反馈效果。CLOT旨在通过多级循环学习机制解决这一问题。

Method: CLOT采用编码器-解码器架构，通过解决两个独立的OT问题学习伪标签和帧/段嵌入，并通过跨注意力机制和第三个OT问题优化帧嵌入和伪标签。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验表明，循环学习对无监督动作分割具有显著优势。

Conclusion: CLOT通过引入多级循环特征学习机制，显著提升了无监督动作分割的性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised action segmentation has recently pushed its limits with ASOT, an
optimal transport (OT)-based method that simultaneously learns action
representations and performs clustering using pseudo-labels. Unlike other
OT-based approaches, ASOT makes no assumptions on the action ordering, and it
is able to decode a temporally consistent segmentation from a noisy cost matrix
between video frames and action labels. However, the resulting segmentation
lacks segment-level supervision, which limits the effectiveness of the feedback
between frames and action representations. To address this limitation, we
propose Closed Loop Optimal Transport (CLOT), a novel OT-based framework that
introduces a multi-level cyclic feature learning mechanism. Leveraging its
encoder-decoder architecture, CLOT learns pseudo-labels alongside frame and
segment embeddings by solving two separate OT problems. It then refines both
frame embeddings and pseudo-labels through cross-attention between the learned
frame and segment embeddings, integrating a third OT problem. Experimental
results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the benefits of cyclical
learning for unsupervised action segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文比较了通用基础模型（如CLIP、BLIP、LLaVa、DINO）与领域特定人脸识别模型（如AdaFace、ArcFace）在人脸识别任务中的表现，发现领域特定模型在零样本任务中表现更优，但基础模型在上下文信息丰富时表现提升，且融合两者可提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨通用基础模型与领域特定模型在人脸识别任务中的性能差异，以及如何结合两者以提高识别准确性和可解释性。

Method: 通过多个基准数据集和实验，比较不同模型在零样本和融合场景下的表现，并分析上下文信息对基础模型的影响。

Result: 领域特定模型在零样本任务中表现更优；基础模型在上下文丰富时性能提升；融合两者可显著提高低误匹配率下的识别准确率；基础模型还能增强可解释性。

Conclusion: 结合领域特定模型与通用基础模型可优化人脸识别性能，尤其是在低误匹配率和高可解释性需求场景中。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the following question: How do generic foundation
models (e.g., CLIP, BLIP, LLaVa, DINO) compare against a domain-specific face
recognition model (viz., AdaFace or ArcFace) on the face recognition task?
Through a series of experiments involving several foundation models and
benchmark datasets, we are able to report the following findings: (a) In all
datasets considered, domain-specific models outperformed zero-shot foundation
models. (b) The performance of zero-shot generic foundation models improves on
over-segmented face images than tightly cropped faces thereby suggesting the
importance of contextual clues. For example, at a False Match Rate (FMR) of
0.01%, the True Match Rate (TMR) of OpenCLIP improved from 64.97% to 81.73% on
the LFW dataset as the face crop increased from 112x112 to 250x250 while the
TMR of domain-specific AdaFace dropped from 99.09% to 77.31%. (c) A simple
score-level fusion of a foundation model with a domain-specific FR model
improved the accuracy at low FMRs. For example, the TMR of AdaFace when fused
with BLIP improved from 72.64% to 83.31% at an FMR of 0.0001% on the IJB-B
dataset and from 73.17% to 85.81% on the IJB-C dataset. (d) Foundation models,
such as ChatGPT, can be used to impart explainability to the FR pipeline (e.g.,
``Despite minor lighting and head tilt differences, the two left-profile images
show high consistency in forehead slope, nose shape, chin contour...''). In
some instances, foundation models are even able to resolve low-confidence
decisions made by AdaFace (e.g., ``Although AdaFace assigns a low similarity
score of 0.21, both images exhibit visual similarity...and the pair is likely
of the same person''), thereby reiterating the importance of combining
domain-specific FR models with generic foundation models in a judicious manner.

Motivation: 研究文本视觉描述符在视觉概念发现和图像分类中的有效性，探讨其与视觉语言模型预训练数据的复杂关系。

Result: 揭示了不同描述符生成策略与基础模型特性的交互方式，提供了超越准确率评估的研究视角。

Conclusion: 提出的对齐指标为研究描述符有效性提供了新方法，有助于优化视觉语言模型的应用。

Abstract: Text-based visual descriptors-ranging from simple class names to more
descriptive phrases-are widely used in visual concept discovery and image
classification with vision-language models (VLMs). Their effectiveness,
however, depends on a complex interplay of factors, including semantic clarity,
presence in the VLM's pre-training data, and how well the descriptors serve as
a meaningful representation space. In this work, we systematically analyze
descriptor quality along two key dimensions: (1) representational capacity, and
(2) relationship with VLM pre-training data. We evaluate a spectrum of
descriptor generation methods, from zero-shot LLM-generated prompts to
iteratively refined descriptors. Motivated by ideas from representation
alignment and language understanding, we introduce two alignment-based
metrics-Global Alignment and CLIP Similarity-that move beyond accuracy. These
metrics allow us to shed light on how different descriptor generation
strategies interact with foundation model properties, offering insights into
ways of studying descriptor effectiveness beyond accuracy evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑卒中是全球死亡和长期残疾的主要原因之一，需要快速准确的预测技术。传统方法依赖单切片预测，机器学习为改进诊断提供了新途径。

Method: 使用预训练模型（如DenseNet201、MobileNetV2等）进行特征提取，结合BFO、PCA和LDA等特征工程技术，再用SVC、RF等分类器进行分类。

Result: MobileNetV2、LDA和SVC的组合达到97.93%的最高分类准确率，显著优于其他组合。

Conclusion: 轻量级预训练模型结合优化和分类技术对脑卒中诊断有效。

Abstract: Brain stroke is one of the leading causes of mortality and long-term
disability worldwide, highlighting the need for precise and fast prediction
techniques. Computed Tomography (CT) scan is considered one of the most
effective methods for diagnosing brain strokes. The majority of stroke
classification techniques rely on a single slice-level prediction mechanism,
allowing the radiologist to manually choose the most critical CT slice from the
original CT volume. Although clinical evaluations are often used in traditional
diagnostic procedures, machine learning (ML) has opened up new avenues for
improving stroke diagnosis. To supplement traditional diagnostic techniques,
this study investigates the use of machine learning models, specifically
concerning the prediction of brain stroke at an early stage utilizing CT scan
images. In this research, we proposed a novel approach to brain stroke
detection leveraging machine learning techniques, focusing on optimizing
classification performance with pre-trained deep learning models and advanced
optimization strategies. Pre-trained models, including DenseNet201,
InceptionV3, MobileNetV2, ResNet50, and Xception, are utilized for feature
extraction. Additionally, we employed feature engineering techniques, including
BFO, PCA, and LDA, to enhance models' performance further. These features are
subsequently classified using machine learning algorithms such as SVC, RF, XGB,
DT, LR, KNN, and GNB. Our experiments demonstrate that the combination of
MobileNetV2, LDA, and SVC achieved the highest classification accuracy of
97.93%, significantly outperforming other model-optimizer-classifier
combinations. The results underline the effectiveness of integrating
lightweight pre-trained models with robust optimization and classification
techniques for brain stroke diagnosis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆的车载传感器可能被遮挡或视野受限，而路边基础设施可以从高处提供更广的视野，但传统3D目标检测算法难以适应这种视角变化。

Method: 采用2.5D目标检测框架，检测车辆地面平面的平行四边形，保留平面位置、大小和方向，忽略高度。训练数据结合真实和合成场景。

Result: 在未见过的摄像头视角和恶劣天气条件下表现出高检测精度、强泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法为自动驾驶车辆提供了有效的补充感知信息，适用于复杂环境。

Abstract: On-board sensors of autonomous vehicles can be obstructed, occluded, or
limited by restricted fields of view, complicating downstream driving
decisions. Intelligent roadside infrastructure perception systems, installed at
elevated vantage points, can provide wide, unobstructed intersection coverage,
supplying a complementary information stream to autonomous vehicles via
vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication. However, conventional 3D
object-detection algorithms struggle to generalize under the domain shift
introduced by top-down perspectives and steep camera angles. We introduce a
2.5D object detection framework, tailored specifically for infrastructure
roadside-mounted cameras. Unlike conventional 2D or 3D object detection, we
employ a prediction approach to detect ground planes of vehicles as
parallelograms in the image frame. The parallelogram preserves the planar
position, size, and orientation of objects while omitting their height, which
is unnecessary for most downstream applications. For training, a mix of
real-world and synthetically generated scenes is leveraged. We evaluate
generalizability on a held-out camera viewpoint and in adverse-weather
scenarios absent from the training set. Our results show high detection
accuracy, strong cross-viewpoint generalization, and robustness to diverse
lighting and weather conditions. Model weights and inference code are provided

Conclusion: 结论指出ViFMs在科学应用中有潜力，但需进一步开发更具通用性的模型。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a proliferation of spatiotemporal foundation
models in different scientific disciplines. While promising, these models are
often domain-specific and are only assessed within the particular applications
for which they are designed. Given that many tasks can be represented as video
modeling problems, video foundation models (ViFMs) hold considerable promise as
general-purpose domain-agnostic approaches. However, it is not known whether
the knowledge acquired on large-scale but potentially out-of-domain data can be
effectively transferred across diverse scientific disciplines, and if a single,
pretrained ViFM can be competitive with domain-specific baselines. To address
this, we introduce SciVid, a comprehensive benchmark comprising five
*Sci*entific *Vid*eo tasks, across medical computer vision, animal behavior,
and weather forecasting. We adapt six leading ViFMs to SciVid using simple
trainable readout modules, establishing strong baselines and demonstrating the
potential for effective transfer learning. Specifically, we show that
state-of-the-art results can be obtained in several applications by leveraging
the general-purpose representations from ViFM backbones. Furthermore, our
results reveal the limitations of existing ViFMs, and highlight opportunities
for the development of generalizable models for high-impact scientific
applications. We release our code at https://github.com/google-deepmind/scivid
to facilitate further research in the development of ViFMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习模型在医学图像分割中因学习虚假相关性而泛化能力差的问题。

Method: 结合冻结的SAM编码器，采用语言对抗解耦（LAD）和测试时因果干预（TCI）技术。

Result: 在跨扫描器、跨模态和跨解剖学设置下，平均Dice分数提高6.2分，Hausdorff距离减少15.8毫米。

Conclusion: Causal-SAM-LLM为构建鲁棒、高效且交互可控的医学AI系统开辟了新方向。

Abstract: The clinical utility of deep learning models for medical image segmentation
is severely constrained by their inability to generalize to unseen domains.
This failure is often rooted in the models learning spurious correlations
between anatomical content and domain-specific imaging styles. To overcome this
fundamental challenge, we introduce Causal-SAM-LLM, a novel framework that
elevates Large Language Models (LLMs) to the role of causal reasoners. Our
framework, built upon a frozen Segment Anything Model (SAM) encoder,
incorporates two synergistic innovations. First, Linguistic Adversarial
Disentanglement (LAD) employs a Vision-Language Model to generate rich, textual
descriptions of confounding image styles. By training the segmentation model's
features to be contrastively dissimilar to these style descriptions, it learns
a representation robustly purged of non-causal information. Second, Test-Time
Causal Intervention (TCI) provides an interactive mechanism where an LLM
interprets a clinician's natural language command to modulate the segmentation
decoder's features in real-time, enabling targeted error correction. We conduct
an extensive empirical evaluation on a composite benchmark from four public
datasets (BTCV, CHAOS, AMOS, BraTS), assessing generalization under
cross-scanner, cross-modality, and cross-anatomy settings. Causal-SAM-LLM
establishes a new state of the art in out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness,
improving the average Dice score by up to 6.2 points and reducing the Hausdorff
Distance by 15.8 mm over the strongest baseline, all while using less than 9%
of the full model's trainable parameters. Our work charts a new course for
building robust, efficient, and interactively controllable medical AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG信号分析面临标记数据有限、高维度和缺乏捕捉时空依赖的模型等问题，现有SSL方法仅关注空间或时间特征，导致表征不理想。

Method: 将EEG信号视为视频序列，利用V-JEPA框架学习联合嵌入和自适应掩码，提取时空特征。

Result: 在TUH数据集上分类准确率优于现有方法，并能捕捉生理相关的时空模式。

Conclusion: EEG-VJEPA为临床EEG分析提供了可扩展且可信的框架，支持人机协作诊断。

Abstract: EEG signals capture brain activity with high temporal and low spatial
resolution, supporting applications such as neurological diagnosis, cognitive
monitoring, and brain-computer interfaces. However, effective analysis is
hindered by limited labeled data, high dimensionality, and the absence of
scalable models that fully capture spatiotemporal dependencies. Existing
self-supervised learning (SSL) methods often focus on either spatial or
temporal features, leading to suboptimal representations. To this end, we
propose EEG-VJEPA, a novel adaptation of the Video Joint Embedding Predictive
Architecture (V-JEPA) for EEG classification. By treating EEG as video-like
sequences, EEG-VJEPA learns semantically meaningful spatiotemporal
representations using joint embeddings and adaptive masking. To our knowledge,
this is the first work that exploits V-JEPA for EEG classification and explores
the visual concepts learned by the model. Evaluations on the publicly available
Temple University Hospital (TUH) Abnormal EEG dataset show that EEG-VJEPA
outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in classification accuracy.Beyond
classification accuracy, EEG-VJEPA captures physiologically relevant spatial
and temporal signal patterns, offering interpretable embeddings that may
support human-AI collaboration in diagnostic workflows. These findings position
EEG-VJEPA as a promising framework for scalable, trustworthy EEG analysis in
real-world clinical settings.

Motivation: 现有方法仅关注文本模态的原型学习，忽略了类别名称的模糊语义，导致原型无法充分捕捉视觉概念，性能受限。

Method: ProtoMM通过将原型视为文本描述和视觉粒子的离散分布，动态更新视觉粒子，并结合最优传输问题量化原型和测试图像的语义距离。

Result: 在15个零样本基准测试中，ProtoMM平均准确率提升1.03%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ProtoMM通过多模态原型动态学习，显著提升了预训练视觉语言模型在测试时的适应性和泛化能力。

Abstract: With the increasing attention to pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs),
\eg, CLIP, substantial efforts have been devoted to many downstream tasks,
especially in test-time adaptation (TTA). However, previous works focus on
learning prototypes only in the textual modality while overlooking the
ambiguous semantics in class names. These ambiguities lead to textual
prototypes that are insufficient to capture visual concepts, resulting in
limited performance. To address this issue, we introduce \textbf{ProtoMM}, a
training-free framework that constructs multimodal prototypes to adapt VLMs
during the test time. By viewing the prototype as a discrete distribution over
the textual descriptions and visual particles, ProtoMM has the ability to
combine the multimodal features for comprehensive prototype learning. More
importantly, the visual particles are dynamically updated as the testing stream
flows. This allows our multimodal prototypes to continually learn from the
data, enhancing their generalizability in unseen scenarios. In addition, we
quantify the importance of the prototypes and test images by formulating their
semantic distance as an optimal transport problem. Extensive experiments on 15
zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving a
1.03\% average accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art methods on ImageNet
and its variant datasets.

Method: 通过7种流行编码器和9个数据集（涵盖年龄、人群计数、头部姿态等属性），测试模型是否能在少量样本下恢复排名轴。

Result: 许多嵌入模型能自然支持排名轴，仅需少量样本（甚至两个极端例子）即可恢复有意义的排名轴。

Conclusion: 研究为图像排名在向量数据库中的应用提供了新思路，并推动了对可排名嵌入结构的进一步研究。

Abstract: We study whether visual embedding models capture continuous, ordinal
attributes along linear directions, which we term _rank axes_. We define a
model as _rankable_ for an attribute if projecting embeddings onto such an axis
preserves the attribute's order. Across 7 popular encoders and 9 datasets with
attributes like age, crowd count, head pose, aesthetics, and recency, we find
that many embeddings are inherently rankable. Surprisingly, a small number of
samples, or even just two extreme examples, often suffice to recover meaningful
rank axes, without full-scale supervision. These findings open up new use cases
for image ranking in vector databases and motivate further study into the
structure and learning of rankable embeddings. Our code is available at

Conclusion: SAMed-2在医学图像分割中具有优越性能，适用于多任务场景。

Abstract: Recent "segment anything" efforts show promise by learning from large-scale
data, but adapting such models directly to medical images remains challenging
due to the complexity of medical data, noisy annotations, and continual
learning requirements across diverse modalities and anatomical structures. In
this work, we propose SAMed-2, a new foundation model for medical image
segmentation built upon the SAM-2 architecture. Specifically, we introduce a
temporal adapter into the image encoder to capture image correlations and a
confidence-driven memory mechanism to store high-certainty features for later
retrieval. This memory-based strategy counters the pervasive noise in
large-scale medical datasets and mitigates catastrophic forgetting when
encountering new tasks or modalities. To train and evaluate SAMed-2, we curate
MedBank-100k, a comprehensive dataset spanning seven imaging modalities and 21
medical segmentation tasks. Our experiments on both internal benchmarks and 10
external datasets demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art
baselines in multi-task scenarios. The code is available at:

Conclusion: 展示了LLMs在手势识别中的潜力，为无训练框架提供了新思路。

Abstract: Sign spotting, the task of identifying and localizing individual signs within
continuous sign language video, plays a pivotal role in scaling dataset
annotations and addressing the severe data scarcity issue in sign language
translation. While automatic sign spotting holds great promise for enabling
frame-level supervision at scale, it grapples with challenges such as
vocabulary inflexibility and ambiguity inherent in continuous sign streams.
Hence, we introduce a novel, training-free framework that integrates Large
Language Models (LLMs) to significantly enhance sign spotting quality. Our
approach extracts global spatio-temporal and hand shape features, which are
then matched against a large-scale sign dictionary using dynamic time warping
and cosine similarity. This dictionary-based matching inherently offers
superior vocabulary flexibility without requiring model retraining. To mitigate
noise and ambiguity from the matching process, an LLM performs context-aware
gloss disambiguation via beam search, notably without fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world sign language datasets demonstrate
our method's superior accuracy and sentence fluency compared to traditional
approaches, highlighting the potential of LLMs in advancing sign spotting.

Abstract: Existing pre-impact fall detection systems have high accuracy, however they
are either intrusive to the subject or require heavy computational resources
for fall detection, resulting in prohibitive deployment costs. These factors
limit the global adoption of existing fall detection systems. In this work we
present a Pre-impact fall detection system that is both non-intrusive and
computationally efficient at deployment. Our system utilizes video data of the
locality available through cameras, thereby requiring no specialized equipment
to be worn by the subject. Further, the fall detection system utilizes minimal
fall specific features and simplistic neural network models, designed to reduce
the computational cost of the system. A minimal set of fall specific features
are derived from the skeletal data, post observing the relative position of
human skeleton during fall. These features are shown to have different
distributions for Fall and non-fall scenarios proving their discriminative
capability. A Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) based network is selected and the
network architecture and training parameters are designed after evaluation of
performance on standard datasets. In the Pre-impact fall detection system the
computation requirement is about 18 times lesser than existing modules with a
comparable accuracy of 88%. Given the low computation requirements and higher
accuracy levels, the proposed system is suitable for wider adoption in
engineering systems related to industrial and residential safety.

Conclusion: SimpAgent通过高效上下文建模，为GUI代理的性能和效率提供了平衡解决方案。

Abstract: The research focus of GUI agents is shifting from text-dependent to
pure-vision-based approaches, which, though promising, prioritize comprehensive
pre-training data collection while neglecting contextual modeling challenges.
We probe the characteristics of element and history contextual modeling in GUI
agent and summarize: 1) the high-density and loose-relation of element context
highlight the existence of many unrelated elements and their negative
influence; 2) the high redundancy of history context reveals the inefficient
history modeling in current GUI agents. In this work, we propose a
context-aware simplification framework for building an efficient and effective
GUI Agent, termed SimpAgent. To mitigate potential interference from numerous
unrelated elements, we introduce a masking-based element pruning method that
circumvents the intractable relation modeling through an efficient masking
mechanism. To reduce the redundancy in historical information, we devise a
consistency-guided history compression module, which enhances implicit
LLM-based compression through innovative explicit guidance, achieving an
optimal balance between performance and efficiency. With the above components,
SimpAgent reduces 27% FLOPs and achieves superior GUI navigation performances.
Comprehensive navigation experiments across diverse web and mobile environments
demonstrate the effectiveness and potential of our agent.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: S3PO-GS是一种基于3D高斯泼溅的RGB-only SLAM方法，解决了户外场景中几何先验缺失和尺度漂移问题，通过自一致跟踪模块和动态映射模块提升了跟踪精度和场景重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS SLAM方法在户外场景中缺乏几何先验或存在尺度漂移问题，限制了其性能。

Method: 提出自一致跟踪模块和基于补丁的动态映射模块，结合3DGS点图避免尺度漂移并引入几何先验。

Result: 在Waymo、KITTI和DL3DV数据集上，S3PO-GS在视图合成和跟踪精度上达到最优。

Conclusion: S3PO-GS在复杂户外环境中表现优异，显著提升了跟踪和重建效果。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a popular solution in SLAM due to its
high-fidelity and real-time novel view synthesis performance. However, some
previous 3DGS SLAM methods employ a differentiable rendering pipeline for
tracking, \textbf{lack geometric priors} in outdoor scenes. Other approaches
introduce separate tracking modules, but they accumulate errors with
significant camera movement, leading to \textbf{scale drift}. To address these
challenges, we propose a robust RGB-only outdoor 3DGS SLAM method: S3PO-GS.
Technically, we establish a self-consistent tracking module anchored in the
3DGS pointmap, which avoids cumulative scale drift and achieves more precise
and robust tracking with fewer iterations. Additionally, we design a
patch-based pointmap dynamic mapping module, which introduces geometric priors
while avoiding scale ambiguity. This significantly enhances tracking accuracy
and the quality of scene reconstruction, making it particularly suitable for
complex outdoor environments. Our experiments on the Waymo, KITTI, and DL3DV
datasets demonstrate that S3PO-GS achieves state-of-the-art results in novel
view synthesis and outperforms other 3DGS SLAM methods in tracking accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Flow-Anchored Consistency Model (FACM)通过将Flow Matching任务作为锚点，解决了Continuous-time Consistency Models训练不稳定的问题，实现了高效的少步生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continuous-time Consistency Models（CMs）在少步生成中表现高效，但训练不稳定。研究发现这种不稳定性源于模型仅学习概率流的捷径，而忽略了定义流的瞬时速度场。

Method: 提出FACM，通过在训练中显式地将模型锚定在底层流上，使用Flow Matching任务作为CM捷径目标的锚点，无需架构修改。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256上，FACM实现了NFE=2时FID 1.32和NFE=1时FID 1.76，显著优于先前方法。

Conclusion: FACM为构建高性能少步生成模型提供了一种通用且有效的方案。

Abstract: Continuous-time Consistency Models (CMs) promise efficient few-step
generation but face significant challenges with training instability. We argue
this instability stems from a fundamental conflict: by training a network to
learn only a shortcut across a probability flow, the model loses its grasp on
the instantaneous velocity field that defines the flow. Our solution is to
explicitly anchor the model in the underlying flow during training. We
introduce the Flow-Anchored Consistency Model (FACM), a simple but effective
training strategy that uses a Flow Matching (FM) task as an anchor for the
primary CM shortcut objective. This Flow-Anchoring approach requires no
architectural modifications and is broadly compatible with standard model
architectures. By distilling a pre-trained LightningDiT model, our method
achieves a state-of-the-art FID of 1.32 with two steps (NFE=2) and 1.76 with
just one step (NFE=1) on ImageNet 256x256, significantly outperforming previous
methods. This provides a general and effective recipe for building
high-performance, few-step generative models. Our code and pretrained models:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球对放射科医生的需求激增，但供给不足，计算机视觉和图像处理技术有望填补这一缺口。

Method: 整合EVA ViT和Llama 2 LLM，将X光图像转换为token，结合提示词进行疾病分类和定位。

Result: 在VinDr-CXR数据集上F1得分为0.76，成功生成感兴趣区域的边界框。

Conclusion: ChestGPT为放射科医生提供辅助工具，减轻其工作负担。

Abstract: The global demand for radiologists is increasing rapidly due to a growing
reliance on medical imaging services, while the supply of radiologists is not
keeping pace. Advances in computer vision and image processing technologies
present significant potential to address this gap by enhancing radiologists'
capabilities and improving diagnostic accuracy. Large language models (LLMs),
particularly generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs), have become the
primary approach for understanding and generating textual data. In parallel,
vision transformers (ViTs) have proven effective at converting visual data into
a format that LLMs can process efficiently. In this paper, we present ChestGPT,
a deep-learning framework that integrates the EVA ViT with the Llama 2 LLM to
classify diseases and localize regions of interest in chest X-ray images. The
ViT converts X-ray images into tokens, which are then fed, together with
engineered prompts, into the LLM, enabling joint classification and
localization of diseases. This approach incorporates transfer learning
techniques to enhance both explainability and performance. The proposed method
achieved strong global disease classification performance on the VinDr-CXR
dataset, with an F1 score of 0.76, and successfully localized pathologies by
generating bounding boxes around the regions of interest. We also outline
several task-specific prompts, in addition to general-purpose prompts, for
scenarios radiologists might encounter. Overall, this framework offers an
assistive tool that can lighten radiologists' workload by providing preliminary
findings and regions of interest to facilitate their diagnostic process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能充分利用事件和帧数据的互补信息，导致训练复杂和计算成本高。

Method: 采用Spiking Neural Network和Artificial Neural Network分支，结合ATW Injector、EDS Injector和CSF模块优化特征融合。

Result: 在多个数据集上达到最先进准确性，并在DSEC-Semantic上能耗降低65%。

Conclusion: 该框架有效结合事件和帧数据，显著提升语义分割性能和能效。

Abstract: Event cameras have recently been introduced into image semantic segmentation,
owing to their high temporal resolution and other advantageous properties.
However, existing event-based semantic segmentation methods often fail to fully
exploit the complementary information provided by frames and events, resulting
in complex training strategies and increased computational costs. To address
these challenges, we propose an efficient hybrid framework for image semantic
segmentation, comprising a Spiking Neural Network branch for events and an
Artificial Neural Network branch for frames. Specifically, we introduce three
specialized modules to facilitate the interaction between these two branches:
the Adaptive Temporal Weighting (ATW) Injector, the Event-Driven Sparse (EDS)
Injector, and the Channel Selection Fusion (CSF) module. The ATW Injector
dynamically integrates temporal features from event data into frame features,
enhancing segmentation accuracy by leveraging critical dynamic temporal
information. The EDS Injector effectively combines sparse event data with rich
frame features, ensuring precise temporal and spatial information alignment.
The CSF module selectively merges these features to optimize segmentation
performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework not only
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy across the DDD17-Seg, DSEC-Semantic, and
M3ED-Semantic datasets but also significantly reduces energy consumption,
achieving a 65\% reduction on the DSEC-Semantic dataset.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的DINOv2预训练策略，通过频率过滤课程学习和高斯噪声补丁增强，显著加速收敛并提高鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模视觉基础模型（如DINOv2）需要大量计算资源，限制了其在私有数据、新模态或科学探索中的应用。

Method: 采用频率过滤课程学习（低频优先）和高斯噪声补丁增强技术。

Result: 在ViT-B/16上，预训练时间和FLOPs分别减少1.6倍和2.25倍，同时保持了与基线相当的鲁棒性和线性探测性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在效率和鲁棒性上取得双重优势，为大规模自监督基础模型提供了更可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Large-scale vision foundation models such as DINOv2 boast impressive
performances by leveraging massive architectures and training datasets. But
numerous scenarios require practitioners to reproduce those pre-training
solutions, such as on private data, new modalities, or simply for scientific
questioning--which is currently extremely demanding computation-wise. We thus
propose a novel pre-training strategy for DINOv2 that simultaneously
accelerates convergence--and strengthens robustness to common corruptions as a
by-product. Our approach involves a frequency filtering
curriculum--low-frequency being seen first--and the Gaussian noise patching
augmentation. Applied to a ViT-B/16 backbone trained on ImageNet-1K, while
pre-training time and FLOPs are reduced by 1.6x and 2.25x, our method still
achieves matching robustness in corruption benchmarks (ImageNet-C) and
maintains competitive linear probing performance compared with baseline. This
dual benefit of efficiency and robustness makes large-scale self-supervised
foundation modeling more attainable, while opening the door to novel
exploration around data curriculum and augmentation as means to improve
self-supervised learning models robustness. The code is available at

Motivation: 随着ViT在安全关键应用中的普及，确保其在比特翻转故障下的正确功能变得至关重要。

Method: 将参数的最低位替换为奇偶校验位以检测错误，检测到故障时通过掩码处理受影响参数。

Result: 该方法显著提升了ViT模型对比特翻转故障的鲁棒性，可靠性提高了三个数量级。

Conclusion: 该技术为零开销的容错解决方案，适用于安全关键应用中的ViT模型。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated superior performance over
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in various vision-related tasks such as
classification, object detection, and segmentation due to their use of
self-attention mechanisms. As ViTs become more popular in safety-critical
applications like autonomous driving, ensuring their correct functionality
becomes essential, especially in the presence of bit-flip faults in their
parameters stored in memory. In this paper, a fault tolerance technique is
introduced to protect ViT parameters against bit-flip faults with zero memory
overhead. Since the least significant bits of parameters are not critical for
model accuracy, replacing the LSB with a parity bit provides an error detection
mechanism without imposing any overhead on the model. When faults are detected,
affected parameters are masked by zeroing out, as most parameters in ViT models
are near zero, effectively preventing accuracy degradation. This approach
enhances reliability across ViT models, improving the robustness of parameters
to bit-flips by up to three orders of magnitude, making it an effective
zero-overhead solution for fault tolerance in critical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VPR方法通常在单一数据集上训练，导致泛化能力受限；多数据集联合训练虽有望解决此问题，但数据集间的差异会限制特征聚合层的信息容量。

Method: 提出Query-based Adaptive Aggregation (QAA)，通过计算查询级图像特征与参考码本之间的Cross-query Similarity (CS)，生成鲁棒描述符。

Result: QAA在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法，实现了平衡的泛化性能，同时保持了与数据集专用模型相当的峰值性能。

Conclusion: QAA通过提升信息容量和多样性注意力模式，为多数据集训练的VPR模型提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning methods for Visual Place Recognition (VPR) have advanced
significantly, largely driven by large-scale datasets. However, most existing
approaches are trained on a single dataset, which can introduce
dataset-specific inductive biases and limit model generalization. While
multi-dataset joint training offers a promising solution for developing
universal VPR models, divergences among training datasets can saturate limited
information capacity in feature aggregation layers, leading to suboptimal
performance. To address these challenges, we propose Query-based Adaptive
Aggregation (QAA), a novel feature aggregation technique that leverages learned
queries as reference codebooks to effectively enhance information capacity
without significant computational or parameter complexity. We show that
computing the Cross-query Similarity (CS) between query-level image features
and reference codebooks provides a simple yet effective way to generate robust
descriptors. Our results demonstrate that QAA outperforms state-of-the-art
models, achieving balanced generalization across diverse datasets while
maintaining peak performance comparable to dataset-specific models. Ablation
studies further explore QAA's mechanisms and scalability. Visualizations reveal
that the learned queries exhibit diverse attention patterns across datasets.
Code will be publicly released.

Conclusion: 该方法在保持图像生成质量的同时，增强了模型的可解释性。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models generate images by iteratively denoising
random noise, conditioned on a prompt. While these models have enabled
impressive progress in image generation, they often fail to accurately reflect
all semantic information described in the prompt -- failures that are difficult
to detect automatically. In this work, we introduce a diffusion model
architecture built with B-cos modules that offers inherent interpretability.
Our approach provides insight into how individual prompt tokens affect the
generated image by producing explanations that highlight the pixel regions
influenced by each token. We demonstrate that B-cos diffusion models can
produce high-quality images while providing meaningful insights into
prompt-image alignment.

Conclusion: ArmGS通过多粒度外观优化，显著提升了动态城市场景建模的逼真度和实时性。

Abstract: This work focuses on modeling dynamic urban environments for autonomous
driving simulation. Contemporary data-driven methods using neural radiance
fields have achieved photorealistic driving scene modeling, but they suffer
from low rendering efficacy. Recently, some approaches have explored 3D
Gaussian splatting for modeling dynamic urban scenes, enabling high-fidelity
reconstruction and real-time rendering. However, these approaches often neglect
to model fine-grained variations between frames and camera viewpoints, leading
to suboptimal results. In this work, we propose a new approach named ArmGS that
exploits composite driving Gaussian splatting with multi-granularity appearance
refinement for autonomous driving scene modeling. The core idea of our approach
is devising a multi-level appearance modeling scheme to optimize a set of
transformation parameters for composite Gaussian refinement from multiple
granularities, ranging from local Gaussian level to global image level and
dynamic actor level. This not only models global scene appearance variations
between frames and camera viewpoints, but also models local fine-grained
changes of background and objects. Extensive experiments on multiple
challenging autonomous driving datasets, namely, Waymo, KITTI, NOTR and
VKITTI2, demonstrate the superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art
methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去雾方法主要关注短距离场景，远距离去雾因信号损失严重而未被充分研究。红外模态具有更好的雾穿透能力，但现有方法常忽略可见光图像中的雾残留。

Method: 提出HSVF框架，包含语义流和视觉流。语义流通过模态不变的内在表示重建无雾场景，视觉流从近红外模态恢复丢失的结构细节。

Result: 实验表明，HSVF在真实远距离去雾任务中优于现有方法，生成高对比度且纹理丰富的场景。

Conclusion: HSVF通过双流协作和多模态融合，有效解决了远距离去雾问题，并提供了新的数据集支持。

Abstract: While image dehazing has advanced substantially in the past decade, most
efforts have focused on short-range scenarios, leaving long-range haze removal
under-explored. As distance increases, intensified scattering leads to severe
haze and signal loss, making it impractical to recover distant details solely
from visible images. Near-infrared, with superior fog penetration, offers
critical complementary cues through multimodal fusion. However, existing
methods focus on content integration while often neglecting haze embedded in
visible images, leading to results with residual haze. In this work, we argue
that the infrared and visible modalities not only provide complementary
low-level visual features, but also share high-level semantic consistency.
Motivated by this, we propose a Hierarchical Semantic-Visual Fusion (HSVF)
framework, comprising a semantic stream to reconstruct haze-free scenes and a
visual stream to incorporate structural details from the near-infrared
modality. The semantic stream first acquires haze-robust semantic prediction by
aligning modality-invariant intrinsic representations. Then the shared
semantics act as strong priors to restore clear and high-contrast distant
scenes under severe haze degradation. In parallel, the visual stream focuses on
recovering lost structural details from near-infrared by fusing complementary
cues from both visible and near-infrared images. Through the cooperation of
dual streams, HSVF produces results that exhibit both high-contrast scenes and
rich texture details. Moreover, we introduce a novel pixel-aligned
visible-infrared haze dataset with semantic labels to facilitate benchmarking.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over
state-of-the-art approaches in real-world long-range haze removal.

Conclusion: 该方法在跨域活动识别中表现出高效性、有效性和普适性。

Abstract: Recently, domain generalization (DG) has emerged as a promising solution to
mitigate distribution-shift issue in sensor-based human activity recognition
(HAR) scenario. However, most existing DG-based works have merely focused on
modeling statistical dependence between sensor data and activity labels,
neglecting the importance of intrinsic casual mechanism. Intuitively, every
sensor input can be viewed as a mixture of causal (category-aware) and
non-causal factors (domain-specific), where only the former affects activity
classification judgment. In this paper, by casting such DG-based HAR as a
casual inference problem, we propose a causality-inspired representation
learning algorithm for cross-domain activity recognition. To this end, an
early-forking two-branch framework is designed, where two separate branches are
respectively responsible for learning casual and non-causal features, while an
independence-based Hilbert-Schmidt Information Criterion is employed to
implicitly disentangling them. Additionally, an inhomogeneous domain sampling
strategy is designed to enhance disentanglement, while a category-aware domain
perturbation layer is performed to prevent representation collapse. Extensive
experiments on several public HAR benchmarks demonstrate that our
causality-inspired approach significantly outperforms eleven related
state-of-the-art baselines under cross-person, cross-dataset, and
cross-position settings. Detailed ablation and visualizations analyses reveal
underlying casual mechanism, indicating its effectiveness, efficiency, and
universality in cross-domain activity recognition scenario.

Abstract: Reconstruction-based methods have demonstrated very promising results for 3D
anomaly detection. However, these methods face great challenges in handling
high-precision point clouds due to the large scale and complex structure. In
this study, a Down-Up Sampling Network (DUS-Net) is proposed to reconstruct
high-precision point clouds for 3D anomaly detection by preserving the group
center geometric structure. The DUS-Net first introduces a Noise Generation
module to generate noisy patches, which facilitates the diversity of training
data and strengthens the feature representation for reconstruction. Then, a
Down-sampling Network~(Down-Net) is developed to learn an anomaly-free center
point cloud from patches with noise injection. Subsequently, an Up-sampling
Network (Up-Net) is designed to reconstruct high-precision point clouds by
fusing multi-scale up-sampling features. Our method leverages group centers for
construction, enabling the preservation of geometric structure and providing a
more precise point cloud. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our proposed method, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with an
Object-level AUROC of 79.9% and 79.5%, and a Point-level AUROC of 71.2% and
84.7% on the Real3D-AD and Anomaly-ShapeNet datasets, respectively.

Conclusion: EchoMimicV3为高效、高质量、通用的人类动画生成提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Human animation recently has advanced rapidly, achieving increasingly
realistic and vivid results, especially with the integration of large-scale
video generation models. However, the slow inference speed and high
computational cost of these large models bring significant challenges for
practical applications. Additionally, various tasks in human animation, such as
lip-syncing, audio-driven full-body animation, and video generation from start
and end frames, often require different specialized models. The introduction of
large video models has not alleviated this dilemma. This raises an important
question: Can we make human animation Faster, Higher in quality, Stronger in
generalization, and make various tasks Together in one model? To address this,
we dive into video generation models and discover that the devil lies in the
details: Inspired by MAE, we propose a novel unified Multi-Task paradigm for
human animation, treating diverse generation tasks as spatial-temporal local
reconstructions, requiring modifications only on the input side; Given the
interplay and division among multi-modal conditions including text, image, and
audio, we introduce a multi-modal decoupled cross-attention module to fuse
multi-modals in a divide-and-conquer manner; We propose a new SFT+Reward
alternating training paradigm, enabling the minimal model with 1.3B parameters
to achieve generation quality comparable to models with 10 times the parameters
count. Through these innovations, our work paves the way for efficient,
high-quality, and versatile digital human generation, addressing both
performance and practicality challenges in the field. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that EchoMimicV3 outperforms existing models in both facial and
semi-body video generation, providing precise text-based control for creating
videos in a wide range of scenarios.

Abstract: Radiology report generation represents a significant application within
medical AI, and has achieved impressive results. Concurrently, large language
models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various domains.
However, empirical validation indicates that general LLMs tend to focus more on
linguistic fluency rather than clinical effectiveness, and lack the ability to
effectively capture the relationship between X-ray images and their
corresponding texts, thus resulting in poor clinical practicability. To address
these challenges, we propose Optimal Transport-Driven Radiology Report
Generation (OTDRG), a novel framework that leverages Optimal Transport (OT) to
align image features with disease labels extracted from reports, effectively
bridging the cross-modal gap. The core component of OTDRG is Alignment \&
Fine-Tuning, where OT utilizes results from the encoding of label features and
image visual features to minimize cross-modal distances, then integrating image
and text features for LLMs fine-tuning. Additionally, we design a novel disease
prediction module to predict disease labels contained in X-ray images during
validation and testing. Evaluated on the MIMIC-CXR and IU X-Ray datasets, OTDRG
achieves state-of-the-art performance in both natural language generation (NLG)
and clinical efficacy (CE) metrics, delivering reports that are not only
linguistically coherent but also clinically accurate.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种半监督分割框架CSDS，通过分离染色外观和组织结构的表示，在低标签数据下实现高性能腺体分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决H&E染色和组织形态的变异性以及标注数据不足对腺体自动分割的挑战。

Method: CSDS框架包含两个学生网络（染色增强和结构增强）和一个共享教师网络，通过伪标签监督和不确定性估计模块优化训练。

Conclusion: CSDS在低标签数据下表现优异，为腺体分割提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate gland segmentation in histopathology images is essential for cancer
diagnosis and prognosis. However, significant variability in Hematoxylin and
Eosin (H&E) staining and tissue morphology, combined with limited annotated
data, poses major challenges for automated segmentation. To address this, we
propose Color-Structure Dual-Student (CSDS), a novel semi-supervised
segmentation framework designed to learn disentangled representations of stain
appearance and tissue structure. CSDS comprises two specialized student
networks: one trained on stain-augmented inputs to model chromatic variation,
and the other on structure-augmented inputs to capture morphological cues. A
shared teacher network, updated via Exponential Moving Average (EMA),
supervises both students through pseudo-labels. To further improve label
reliability, we introduce stain-aware and structure-aware uncertainty
estimation modules that adaptively modulate the contribution of each student
during training. Experiments on the GlaS and CRAG datasets show that CSDS
achieves state-of-the-art performance in low-label settings, with Dice score
improvements of up to 1.2% on GlaS and 0.7% on CRAG at 5% labeled data, and
0.7% and 1.4% at 10%. Our code and pre-trained models are available at

TL;DR: DNF-Intrinsic是一种基于预训练扩散模型的逆渲染方法，通过直接使用源图像而非噪声输入，结合流匹配技术，显著提升了逆渲染的质量和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在噪声到本征属性的映射中因图像结构退化而难以生成高质量结果，而结构和外观信息对逆渲染至关重要。

Method: 提出DNF-Intrinsic，采用源图像作为输入，通过流匹配直接预测确定性本征属性，并设计生成渲染器确保物理一致性。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，DNF-Intrinsic明显优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DNF-Intrinsic通过改进输入和约束机制，实现了高效且高质量的逆渲染。

Abstract: Recent methods have shown that pre-trained diffusion models can be fine-tuned
to enable generative inverse rendering by learning image-conditioned
noise-to-intrinsic mapping. Despite their remarkable progress, they struggle to
robustly produce high-quality results as the noise-to-intrinsic paradigm
essentially utilizes noisy images with deteriorated structure and appearance
for intrinsic prediction, while it is common knowledge that structure and
appearance information in an image are crucial for inverse rendering. To
address this issue, we present DNF-Intrinsic, a robust yet efficient inverse
rendering approach fine-tuned from a pre-trained diffusion model, where we
propose to take the source image rather than Gaussian noise as input to
directly predict deterministic intrinsic properties via flow matching.
Moreover, we design a generative renderer to constrain that the predicted
intrinsic properties are physically faithful to the source image. Experiments
on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method clearly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GCN方法将交互个体视为独立图，忽略了其内在依赖关系，且预定义的交互矩阵无法适应动态和上下文特定的联合交互。

Method: 结合GCN建模个体内部关系，引入AT-NAC模块自适应选择节点，设计EA模块捕捉交互动态和语义关系。

Result: 方法在交互关系捕捉上更有效灵活，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: ASEA方法通过动态节点选择和外部注意力，显著提升了交互建模的适应性和效果。

Abstract: Most GCN-based methods model interacting individuals as independent graphs,
neglecting their inherent inter-dependencies. Although recent approaches
utilize predefined interaction adjacency matrices to integrate participants,
these matrices fail to adaptively capture the dynamic and context-specific
joint interactions across different actions. In this paper, we propose the
Active Node Selection with External Attention Network (ASEA), an innovative
approach that dynamically captures interaction relationships without predefined
assumptions. Our method models each participant individually using a GCN to
capture intra-personal relationships, facilitating a detailed representation of
their actions. To identify the most relevant nodes for interaction modeling, we
introduce the Adaptive Temporal Node Amplitude Calculation (AT-NAC) module,
which estimates global node activity by combining spatial motion magnitude with
adaptive temporal weighting, thereby highlighting salient motion patterns while
reducing irrelevant or redundant information. A learnable threshold,
regularized to prevent extreme variations, is defined to selectively identify
the most informative nodes for interaction modeling. To capture interactions,
we design the External Attention (EA) module to operate on active nodes,
effectively modeling the interaction dynamics and semantic relationships
between individuals. Extensive evaluations show that our method captures
interaction relationships more effectively and flexibly, achieving
state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: 该方法通过低成本传感器实现了高性能场景流估计，适用于智能车辆等实际场景。

Abstract: This work proposes a mmWave radar's scene flow estimation framework
supervised by data from a widespread visual-inertial (VI) sensor suite,
allowing crowdsourced training data from smart vehicles. Current scene flow
estimation methods for mmWave radar are typically supervised by dense point
clouds from 3D LiDARs, which are expensive and not widely available in smart
vehicles. While VI data are more accessible, visual images alone cannot capture
the 3D motions of moving objects, making it difficult to supervise their scene
flow. Moreover, the temporal drift of VI rigid transformation also degenerates
the scene flow estimation of static points. To address these challenges, we
propose a drift-free rigid transformation estimator that fuses kinematic
model-based ego-motions with neural network-learned results. It provides strong
supervision signals to radar-based rigid transformation and infers the scene
flow of static points. Then, we develop an optical-mmWave supervision
extraction module that extracts the supervision signals of radar rigid
transformation and scene flow. It strengthens the supervision by learning the
scene flow of dynamic points with the joint constraints of optical and mmWave
radar measurements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, in smoke-filled
environments, our method even outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches
using costly LiDARs.

Abstract: Synthesizing normal-light novel views from low-light multiview images is an
important yet challenging task, given the low visibility and high ISO noise
present in the input images. Existing low-light enhancement methods often
struggle to effectively preprocess such low-light inputs, as they fail to
consider correlations among multiple views. Although other state-of-the-art
methods have introduced illumination-related components offering alternative
solutions to the problem, they often result in drawbacks such as color
distortions and artifacts, and they provide limited denoising effectiveness. In
this paper, we propose a novel Robust Low-light Scene Restoration framework
(RoSe), which enables effective synthesis of novel views in normal lighting
conditions from low-light multiview image inputs, by formulating the task as an
illuminance transition estimation problem in 3D space, conceptualizing it as a
specialized rendering task. This multiview-consistent illuminance transition
field establishes a robust connection between low-light and normal-light
conditions. By further exploiting the inherent low-rank property of
illumination to constrain the transition representation, we achieve more
effective denoising without complex 2D techniques or explicit noise modeling.
To implement RoSe, we design a concise dual-branch architecture and introduce a
low-rank denoising module. Experiments demonstrate that RoSe significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art models in both rendering quality and multiview
consistency on standard benchmarks. The codes and data are available at

Abstract: Text-driven portrait editing holds significant potential for various

Motivation: 确保语义分割模型在复杂道路环境中的可靠性和安全性，尤其是在OOD检测方面，现有方法在特定场景下表现不佳。

Result: 在标准基准和新定义的RoadAnomaly挑战子集上，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的框架为复杂驾驶环境中的OOD语义分割提供了鲁棒且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Effective Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is criti-cal for ensuring the
reliability of semantic segmentation models, particularly in complex road
environments where safety and accuracy are paramount. Despite recent
advancements in large language models (LLMs), notably GPT-4, which
significantly enhanced multimodal reasoning through Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
prompting, the application of CoT-based visual reasoning for OOD semantic
segmentation remains largely unexplored. In this paper, through extensive
analyses of the road scene anomalies, we identify three challenging scenarios
where current state-of-the-art OOD segmentation methods consistently struggle:
(1) densely packed and overlapping objects, (2) distant scenes with small
objects, and (3) large foreground-dominant objects. To address the presented
challenges, we propose a novel CoT-based framework targeting OOD detection in
road anomaly scenes. Our method leverages the extensive knowledge and reasoning
capabilities of foundation models, such as GPT-4, to enhance OOD detection
through improved image understanding and prompt-based reasoning aligned with
observed problematic scene attributes. Extensive experiments show that our
framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both standard
benchmarks and our newly defined challenging subset of the RoadAnomaly dataset,
offering a robust and interpretable solution for OOD semantic segmentation in
complex driving environments.

remains hidden for blind evaluation. We also propose Rate-Distortion Alignment
Error (RDAE), a novel evaluation metric that quantifies how well VQA models
preserve bitrate-quality ordering, directly supporting codec parameter tuning.
Testing IQA/VQA methods reveals that popular VQA metrics exhibit high RDAE and
lower correlations, underscoring the dataset challenges and utility. The open

Motivation: 现有DGFAS方法虽然能对齐局部决策边界的权重，但偏置项未对齐导致分类阈值不一致，影响性能。

Method: 使用FOD显式分解特征空间为域不变和域特定子空间，并通过GS-RM平衡多域组损失以对齐偏置项。

Result: 在基准数据集上实现了最优性能，提高了准确性并减少了偏置未对齐。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效对齐了权重和偏置项，增强了在未见目标域上的泛化稳定性。

Abstract: Domain Generalizable Face Anti-Spoofing (DGFAS) methods effectively capture
domain-invariant features by aligning the directions (weights) of local
decision boundaries across domains. However, the bias terms associated with
these boundaries remain misaligned, leading to inconsistent classification
thresholds and degraded performance on unseen target domains. To address this
issue, we propose a novel DGFAS framework that jointly aligns weights and
biases through Feature Orthogonal Decomposition (FOD) and Group-wise Scaling
Risk Minimization (GS-RM). Specifically, GS-RM facilitates bias alignment by
balancing group-wise losses across multiple domains. FOD employs the
Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization process to decompose the feature space
explicitly into domain-invariant and domain-specific subspaces. By enforcing
orthogonality between domain-specific and domain-invariant features during
training using domain labels, FOD ensures effective weight alignment across
domains without negatively impacting bias alignment. Additionally, we introduce
Expected Calibration Error (ECE) as a novel evaluation metric for
quantitatively assessing the effectiveness of our method in aligning bias terms
across domains. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently improving
accuracy, reducing bias misalignment, and enhancing generalization stability on
unseen target domains.

Method: 使用英国Countryside Survey的数据，涵盖18种生境类型，评估CNN和ViT在监督和监督对比学习范式下的性能。

Conclusion: 结合AI与生态专业知识，该研究为地面生境监测提供了可扩展、经济高效的框架，有助于加速生物多样性保护和土地利用决策。

Abstract: Habitat assessment at local scales -- critical for enhancing biodiversity and
guiding conservation priorities -- often relies on expert field survey that can
be costly, motivating the exploration of AI-driven tools to automate and refine
this process. While most AI-driven habitat mapping depends on remote sensing,
it is often constrained by sensor availability, weather, and coarse resolution.
In contrast, ground-level imagery captures essential structural and
compositional cues invisible from above and remains underexplored for robust,
fine-grained habitat classification. This study addresses this gap by applying
state-of-the-art deep neural network architectures to ground-level habitat
imagery. Leveraging data from the UK Countryside Survey covering 18 broad
habitat types, we evaluate two families of models -- convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) -- under both supervised and
supervised contrastive learning paradigms. Our results demonstrate that ViTs
consistently outperform state-of-the-art CNN baselines on key classification
metrics (Top-3 accuracy = 91\%, MCC = 0.66) and offer more interpretable scene
understanding tailored to ground-level images. Moreover, supervised contrastive
learning significantly reduces misclassification rates among visually similar
habitats (e.g., Improved vs. Neutral Grassland), driven by a more
discriminative embedding space. Finally, our best model performs on par with
experienced ecological experts in habitat classification from images,
underscoring the promise of expert-level automated assessment. By integrating
advanced AI with ecological expertise, this research establishes a scalable,
cost-effective framework for ground-level habitat monitoring to accelerate
biodiversity conservation and inform land-use decisions at the national scale.

Motivation: 持续学习中灾难性遗忘问题严重，尤其在ViTs中使用MLPs时，新信息会覆盖旧知识。

Method: 用KANs替换ViTs中的MLPs，利用基于样条的局部可塑性，确保每次更新仅涉及部分参数。

Result: 实验结果显示，KAN-based ViTs显著减轻灾难性遗忘，在MNIST和CIFAR100数据集上表现优于传统MLP-based ViTs。

Conclusion: KANs与ViTs的结合为动态环境下的鲁棒和适应性模型提供了新方向。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL), the ability of a model to learn new tasks without
forgetting previously acquired knowledge, remains a critical challenge in
artificial intelligence, particularly for vision transformers (ViTs) utilizing
Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) for global representation learning. Catastrophic
forgetting, where new information overwrites prior knowledge, is especially
problematic in these models. This research proposes replacing MLPs in ViTs with
Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KANs) to address this issue. KANs leverage local
plasticity through spline-based activations, ensuring that only a subset of
parameters is updated per sample, thereby preserving previously learned
knowledge. The study investigates the efficacy of KAN-based ViTs in CL
scenarios across benchmark datasets (MNIST, CIFAR100), focusing on their
ability to retain accuracy on earlier tasks while adapting to new ones.
Experimental results demonstrate that KAN-based ViTs significantly mitigate
catastrophic forgetting, outperforming traditional MLP-based ViTs in knowledge
retention and task adaptation. This novel integration of KANs into ViTs
represents a promising step toward more robust and adaptable models for dynamic
environments.

Abstract: We present PresentAgent, a multimodal agent that transforms long-form
documents into narrated presentation videos. While existing approaches are
limited to generating static slides or text summaries, our method advances
beyond these limitations by producing fully synchronized visual and spoken
content that closely mimics human-style presentations. To achieve this
integration, PresentAgent employs a modular pipeline that systematically
segments the input document, plans and renders slide-style visual frames,
generates contextual spoken narration with large language models and
Text-to-Speech models, and seamlessly composes the final video with precise
audio-visual alignment. Given the complexity of evaluating such multimodal
outputs, we introduce PresentEval, a unified assessment framework powered by
Vision-Language Models that comprehensively scores videos across three critical
dimensions: content fidelity, visual clarity, and audience comprehension
through prompt-based evaluation. Our experimental validation on a curated
dataset of 30 document-presentation pairs demonstrates that PresentAgent
approaches human-level quality across all evaluation metrics. These results
highlight the significant potential of controllable multimodal agents in
transforming static textual materials into dynamic, effective, and accessible
presentation formats. Code will be available at

TL;DR: DIVER是一个结合强化学习和扩散生成模型的端到端自动驾驶框架，旨在解决模仿学习导致的保守行为和泛化能力不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模仿学习依赖单一专家演示，导致行为保守且泛化能力有限，难以适应复杂场景。

Method: DIVER通过扩散生成模型生成多样化轨迹，并结合强化学习优化安全性和多样性。

Result: 实验表明DIVER显著提升轨迹多样性，解决了模仿学习中的模式崩溃问题。

Conclusion: DIVER通过结合扩散生成和强化学习，有效提升了自动驾驶行为的多样性和实用性。

Abstract: Most end-to-end autonomous driving methods rely on imitation learning from
single expert demonstrations, often leading to conservative and homogeneous
behaviors that limit generalization in complex real-world scenarios. In this
work, we propose DIVER, an end-to-end driving framework that integrates
reinforcement learning with diffusion-based generation to produce diverse and
feasible trajectories. At the core of DIVER lies a reinforced diffusion-based
generation mechanism. First, the model conditions on map elements and
surrounding agents to generate multiple reference trajectories from a single
ground-truth trajectory, alleviating the limitations of imitation learning that
arise from relying solely on single expert demonstrations. Second,
reinforcement learning is employed to guide the diffusion process, where
reward-based supervision enforces safety and diversity constraints on the
generated trajectories, thereby enhancing their practicality and generalization
capability. Furthermore, to address the limitations of L2-based open-loop
metrics in capturing trajectory diversity, we propose a novel Diversity metric
to evaluate the diversity of multi-mode predictions.Extensive experiments on
the closed-loop NAVSIM and Bench2Drive benchmarks, as well as the open-loop
nuScenes dataset, demonstrate that DIVER significantly improves trajectory
diversity, effectively addressing the mode collapse problem inherent in
imitation learning.

Result: 在六个细粒度数据集上，DiffGRE优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DiffGRE通过合成数据和多阶段策略有效提升了OCD任务的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a practical yet challenging task: On-the-fly
Category Discovery (OCD). This task focuses on the online identification of
newly arriving stream data that may belong to both known and unknown
categories, utilizing the category knowledge from only labeled data. Existing
OCD methods are devoted to fully mining transferable knowledge from only
labeled data. However, the transferability learned by these methods is limited
because the knowledge contained in known categories is often insufficient,
especially when few annotated data/categories are available in fine-grained
recognition. To mitigate this limitation, we propose a diffusion-based OCD
framework, dubbed DiffGRE, which integrates Generation, Refinement, and
Encoding in a multi-stage fashion. Specifically, we first design an
attribute-composition generation method based on cross-image interpolation in
the diffusion latent space to synthesize novel samples. Then, we propose a
diversity-driven refinement approach to select the synthesized images that
differ from known categories for subsequent OCD model training. Finally, we
leverage a semi-supervised leader encoding to inject additional category
knowledge contained in synthesized data into the OCD models, which can benefit
the discovery of both known and unknown categories during the on-the-fly
inference process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our
DiffGRE over previous methods on six fine-grained datasets.

Motivation: 解决现有方法在预测不同时刻时平等对待的问题，导致短期预测学习受限和先验信息利用不足的局限性。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验验证了TCL的有效性和灵活性。

Conclusion: TCL框架能轻松集成到不同HMP主干模型中，适用于多种数据集和应用。

Abstract: Human Motion Prediction (HMP) aims to predict future poses at different
moments according to past motion sequences. Previous approaches have treated
the prediction of various moments equally, resulting in two main limitations:
the learning of short-term predictions is hindered by the focus on long-term
predictions, and the incorporation of prior information from past predictions
into subsequent predictions is limited. In this paper, we introduce a novel
multi-stage training framework called Temporal Continual Learning (TCL) to
address the above challenges. To better preserve prior information, we
introduce the Prior Compensation Factor (PCF). We incorporate it into the model
training to compensate for the lost prior information. Furthermore, we derive a
more reasonable optimization objective through theoretical derivation. It is
important to note that our TCL framework can be easily integrated with
different HMP backbone models and adapted to various datasets and applications.
Extensive experiments on four HMP benchmark datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness and flexibility of TCL. The code is available at

Abstract: Short-video misinformation detection has attracted wide attention in the
multi-modal domain, aiming to accurately identify the misinformation in the
video format accompanied by the corresponding audio. Despite significant
advancements, current models in this field, trained on particular domains
(source domains), often exhibit unsatisfactory performance on unseen domains
(target domains) due to domain gaps. To effectively realize such domain
generalization on the short-video misinformation detection task, we propose
deep insights into the characteristics of different domains: (1) The detection
on various domains may mainly rely on different modalities (i.e., mainly
focusing on videos or audios). To enhance domain generalization, it is crucial
to achieve optimal model performance on all modalities simultaneously. (2) For
some domains focusing on cross-modal joint fraud, a comprehensive analysis
relying on cross-modal fusion is necessary. However, domain biases located in
each modality (especially in each frame of videos) will be accumulated in this
fusion process, which may seriously damage the final identification of
misinformation. To address these issues, we propose a new DOmain generalization
model via ConsisTency and invariance learning for shORt-video misinformation
detection (named DOCTOR), which contains two characteristic modules: (1) We
involve the cross-modal feature interpolation to map multiple modalities into a
shared space and the interpolation distillation to synchronize multi-modal
learning; (2) We design the diffusion model to add noise to retain core
features of multi modal and enhance domain invariant features through
cross-modal guided denoising. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed DOCTOR model. Our code is public available at

Result: 在四个运动预测数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: STAB和ACB结合AAA策略有效解决了动作预测中的关键问题，提升了预测性能。

Abstract: Action-driven stochastic human motion prediction aims to generate future
motion sequences of a pre-defined target action based on given past observed
sequences performing non-target actions. This task primarily presents two
challenges. Firstly, generating smooth transition motions is hard due to the
varying transition speeds of different actions. Secondly, the action
characteristic is difficult to be learned because of the similarity of some
actions. These issues cause the predicted results to be unreasonable and
inconsistent. As a result, we propose two memory banks, the Soft-transition
Action Bank (STAB) and Action Characteristic Bank (ACB), to tackle the problems
above. The STAB stores the action transition information. It is equipped with
the novel soft searching approach, which encourages the model to focus on
multiple possible action categories of observed motions. The ACB records action
characteristic, which produces more prior information for predicting certain
actions. To fuse the features retrieved from the two banks better, we further
propose the Adaptive Attention Adjustment (AAA) strategy. Extensive experiments
on four motion prediction datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently
outperforms the previous state-of-the-art. The demo and code are available at
https://hyqlat.github.io/STABACB.github.io/.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a high-performing solution to the UAVM 2025
Challenge, which focuses on matching narrow FOV street-level images to
corresponding satellite imagery using the University-1652 dataset. As panoramic
Cross-View Geo-Localisation nears peak performance, it becomes increasingly
important to explore more practical problem formulations. Real-world scenarios
rarely offer panoramic street-level queries; instead, queries typically consist
of limited-FOV images captured with unknown camera parameters. Our work
prioritises discovering the highest achievable performance under these
constraints, pushing the limits of existing architectures. Our method begins by
retrieving candidate satellite image embeddings for a given query, followed by
a re-ranking stage that selectively enhances retrieval accuracy within the top
candidates. This two-stage approach enables more precise matching, even under
the significant viewpoint and scale variations inherent in the task. Through
experimentation, we demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive results
-specifically attaining R@1 and R@10 retrieval rates of \topone\% and \topten\%
respectively. This underscores the potential of optimised retrieval and
re-ranking strategies in advancing practical geo-localisation performance. Code

Motivation: 解决在复杂环境和动态场景中多目标跟踪的挑战，如轨迹中断、动态参数学习和目标分类。

Method: 结合高斯过程作为运动模型和非齐次泊松过程作为观测模型，采用粒子滤波进行推理和超参数学习。GaPP-ReaCtion进一步引入MCMC核以实现轨迹恢复。

Result: 在合成和真实数据测试中，GaPP-Class和GaPP-ReaCtion表现优于现有方法，显著减少轨迹中断（如真实雷达数据中减少约30%）。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在复杂场景中具有鲁棒性和适应性，尤其在轨迹恢复和分类任务中表现优异。

Abstract: This paper presents a computationally efficient multi-object tracking
approach that can minimise track breaks (e.g., in challenging environments and
against agile targets), learn the measurement model parameters on-line (e.g.,
in dynamically changing scenes) and infer the class of the tracked objects, if
joint tracking and kinematic behaviour classification is sought. It capitalises
on the flexibilities offered by the integrated Gaussian process as a motion
model and the convenient statistical properties of non-homogeneous Poisson
processes as a suitable observation model. This can be combined with the
proposed effective track revival / stitching mechanism. We accordingly
introduce the two robust and adaptive trackers, Gaussian and Poisson Process
with Classification (GaPP-Class) and GaPP with Revival and Classification
(GaPP-ReaCtion). They employ an appropriate particle filtering inference scheme
that efficiently integrates track management and hyperparameter learning
(including the object class, if relevant). GaPP-ReaCtion extends GaPP-Class
with the addition of a Markov Chain Monte Carlo kernel applied to each particle
permitting track revival and stitching (e.g., within a few time steps after
deleting a trajectory). Performance evaluation and benchmarking using synthetic
and real data show that GaPP-Class and GaPP-ReaCtion outperform other
state-of-the-art tracking algorithms. For example, GaPP-ReaCtion significantly
reduces track breaks (e.g., by around 30% from real radar data and markedly
more from simulated data).

Motivation: 解决轻量级Vision Transformer在图像超分辨率中因窗口自注意力模型导致的接收域受限和计算复杂度高的问题。

Method: 提出CPB模块，包含全局锚点提示层（GAPL）和两个局部提示层（LPLs），通过跨尺度注意力和类别自注意力优化全局和局部信息。

Result: 实验表明PromptSR在定量、定性和复杂度评估上优于现有轻量级超分辨率方法。

Conclusion: PromptSR通过结合全局先验和局部细节，显著扩大了接收域并保持低计算成本。

Abstract: Although the lightweight Vision Transformer has significantly advanced image
super-resolution (SR), it faces the inherent challenge of a limited receptive
field due to the window-based self-attention modeling. The quadratic
computational complexity relative to window size restricts its ability to use a
large window size for expanding the receptive field while maintaining low
computational costs. To address this challenge, we propose PromptSR, a novel
prompt-empowered lightweight image SR method. The core component is the
proposed cascade prompting block (CPB), which enhances global information
access and local refinement via three cascaded prompting layers: a global
anchor prompting layer (GAPL) and two local prompting layers (LPLs). The GAPL
leverages downscaled features as anchors to construct low-dimensional anchor
prompts (APs) through cross-scale attention, significantly reducing
computational costs. These APs, with enhanced global perception, are then used
to provide global prompts, efficiently facilitating long-range token
connections. The two LPLs subsequently combine category-based self-attention
and window-based self-attention to refine the representation in a
coarse-to-fine manner. They leverage attention maps from the GAPL as additional
global prompts, enabling them to perceive features globally at different
granularities for adaptive local refinement. In this way, the proposed CPB
effectively combines global priors and local details, significantly enlarging
the receptive field while maintaining the low computational costs of our
PromptSR. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method,
which outperforms state-of-the-art lightweight SR methods in quantitative,
qualitative, and complexity evaluations. Our code will be released at
https://github.com/wenyang001/PromptSR.

EMC2 integrates joint hardware-software optimizations, including hardware

followed by a cross-modal fusion strategy to enhance prediction accuracy.
Evaluated on a diverse dataset collected from the University of Leeds Driving

Abstract: Prediction of pedestrian crossing intention is a critical function in
autonomous vehicles. Conventional vision-based methods of crossing intention
prediction often struggle with generalizability, context understanding, and
causal reasoning. This study explores the potential of vision-language
foundation models (VLFMs) for predicting pedestrian crossing intentions by
integrating multimodal data through hierarchical prompt templates. The
methodology incorporates contextual information, including visual frames,
physical cues observations, and ego-vehicle dynamics, into systematically
refined prompts to guide VLFMs effectively in intention prediction. Experiments
were conducted on three common datasets-JAAD, PIE, and FU-PIP. Results
demonstrate that incorporating vehicle speed, its variations over time, and
time-conscious prompts significantly enhances the prediction accuracy up to
19.8%. Additionally, optimised prompts generated via an automatic prompt
engineering framework yielded 12.5% further accuracy gains. These findings
highlight the superior performance of VLFMs compared to conventional
vision-based models, offering enhanced generalisation and contextual
understanding for autonomous driving applications.

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优于主流模型，人类评估证实其生成质量和语义一致性。

Conclusion: Hi-SSLVLM为可控且语义一致的文本到图像生成提供了重要进展。

Abstract: This paper introduces Hierarchical Self-Supervised LVLM (Hi-SSLVLM), a novel
generative model designed to significantly advance text-to-image synthesis,
particularly for complex and compositionally challenging prompts. Traditional
methods often grapple with the high cost of meticulously curated paired
image-text datasets and struggle with precise control over fine-grained visual
attributes and intricate spatial relationships. Our Hi-SSLVLM addresses these
limitations through a unique two-stage self-supervised learning strategy. The
first stage, Multi-Granularity Visual-Language Grounding, enables the Large
Vision-Language Model (LVLM) backbone to autonomously generate and align
hierarchical captions (global and local) to images, cultivating a deep internal
semantic understanding without reliance on extensive human annotation. The
second stage, Self-Refinement and Guided Image Generation, leverages this
acquired knowledge by an Internal Compositional Planning (ICP) mechanism, where
the LVLM first formulates detailed textual sub-prompts to guide the image
generation process, complemented by a novel Semantic Consistency Loss for
precise output alignment. Comprehensive experiments against leading baselines,
including Janus-Pro-1B, Stable Diffusion XL 1.0, DeepFloyd IF v1.0, and
ControlNet-XL, on multi-dimensional benchmarks such as Gemini-2.0-Flash and
InternVL3-78B, demonstrate Hi-SSLVLM's superior performance across all
fine-grained metrics. An in-depth ablation study confirms the critical role of
each proposed component. Furthermore, human evaluations corroborate our
quantitative findings, highlighting Hi-SSLVLM's enhanced fidelity to prompt,
compositional accuracy, and overall aesthetic quality, marking a significant
step towards more controllable and semantically consistent open-ended
text-to-image generation.

Abstract: The burgeoning field of generative artificial intelligence has fundamentally
reshaped our approach to content creation, with Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs) standing at its forefront. While current LVLMs have demonstrated
impressive capabilities in text-to-image generation, they often falter when
confronted with complex textual descriptions demanding precise compositional
understanding and visual planning. This limitation particularly impacts the
accurate rendering of multiple objects, their attributes, spatial
relationships, and specific poses within intricate scenes, as evidenced by
benchmarks like LongBench-T2I. To address these challenges, we introduce
LVLM-Composer, a novel 10-billion parameter scale LVLM specifically engineered
for enhanced compositional image synthesis. Our method incorporates a
Hierarchical Semantic Planning Module for structured prompt decomposition and a
Fine-Grained Feature Alignment Mechanism for precise visual guidance during
generation. We propose a multi-stage training paradigm, featuring Hierarchical
Semantic-Visual Grounding Pre-training and Compositional Planning Reinforcement
Learning with Self-Correction, to instill robust compositional reasoning.
Extensive experiments on the LongBench-T2I benchmark, utilizing automatic
evaluation by Gemini-2.0-Flash and InternVL3-78B, demonstrate LVLM-Composer's
superior performance across critical compositional dimensions including object
accuracy, composition fidelity, and pose accuracy, significantly outperforming

to be consistent with the underlying 3D motions. While previous works learn
such consistency by training from multiple views, the generated scene regions
are bounded to be close to the training views with limited camera movements. To
address this issue, we propose DynamicVoyager that reformulates the dynamic
scene generation as a scene outpainting process for new dynamic content. As 2D
outpainting models can hardly generate 3D consistent motions from only 2D
pixels at a single view, we consider pixels as rays to enrich the pixel input
with the ray context, so that the 3D motion consistency can be learned from the
ray information. More specifically, we first map the single-view video input to
a dynamic point cloud with the estimated video depths. Then we render the
partial video at a novel view and outpaint the video with ray contexts from the
point cloud to generate 3D consistent motions. We employ the outpainted video
to update the point cloud, which is used for scene outpainting from future
novel views. Experiments show that our model is able to generate unbounded
scenes with consistent motions along fly-through cameras, and the generated
contents can be controlled with scene prompts.

*Yu-Shan Tai,An-Yeu,Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种快速绕过机制（QBM）和修正反向过程（RRP），以加速扩散模型在图像恢复任务中的去噪过程，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本方法在图像恢复任务中迭代时间过长，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 通过QBM从中间近似初始化以跳过早期去噪步骤，并通过RRP调整随机噪声权重以增强随机性。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K和CelebA-HQ数据集上验证，QBM和RRP能显著加速去噪过程且不影响性能。

Conclusion: QBM和RRP为扩散模型在图像恢复任务中提供了一种高效且性能稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success
in various image generation tasks. Building upon these achievements, diffusion
models have also been effectively adapted to image restoration tasks, e.g.,
super-resolution and deblurring, aiming to recover high-quality images from
degraded inputs. Although existing zero-shot approaches enable pretrained
diffusion models to perform restoration tasks without additional fine-tuning,
these methods often suffer from prolonged iteration times in the denoising
process. To address this limitation, we propose a Quick Bypass Mechanism (QBM),
a strategy that significantly accelerates the denoising process by initializing
from an intermediate approximation, effectively bypassing early denoising
steps. Furthermore, recognizing that approximation may introduce
inconsistencies, we introduce a Revised Reverse Process (RRP), which adjusts
the weighting of random noise to enhance the stochasticity and mitigate
potential disharmony. We validate proposed methods on ImageNet-1K and CelebA-HQ
across multiple image restoration tasks, e.g., super-resolution, deblurring,
and compressed sensing. Our experimental results show that the proposed methods
can effectively accelerate existing methods while maintaining original
performance.

Conclusion: 该方法实现了高质量、语义对齐的风格迁移，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: This paper presents a portrait style transfer method that generalizes well to
various different domains while enabling high-quality semantic-aligned
stylization on regions including hair, eyes, eyelashes, skins, lips, and
background. To this end, we propose to establish dense semantic correspondence
between the given input and reference portraits based on a pre-trained model
and a semantic adapter, with which we obtain a warped reference semantically
aligned with the input. To ensure effective yet controllable style transfer, we
devise an AdaIN-Wavelet transform to balance content preservation and
stylization by blending low-frequency information of the warped reference with
high-frequency information of the input in the latent space. A style adapter is
also designed to provide style guidance from the warped reference. With the
stylized latent from AdaIN-Wavelet transform, we employ a dual-conditional
diffusion model that integrates a ControlNet recording high-frequency
information and the style guidance to generate the final result. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method. Our code and trained
model are available at https://github.com/wangxb29/DGPST.

Motivation: 实验室小鼠的3D表面运动重建因复杂的非刚性变形和无纹理外观而困难，且缺乏结构化3D数据集。

Method: 构建高保真合成数据集，采用基于transformer的三平面表示架构，并设计地标嵌入以提升重建稳定性。

Result: MoReMouse在精度和鲁棒性上显著优于现有开源方法。

Conclusion: MoReMouse为小鼠3D重建提供了高效解决方案，填补了研究空白。

Abstract: Laboratory mice play a crucial role in biomedical research, yet accurate 3D
mouse surface motion reconstruction remains challenging due to their complex
non-rigid geometric deformations and textureless appearance. Moreover, the
absence of structured 3D datasets severely hinders the progress beyond sparse
keypoint tracking. To narrow the gap, we present MoReMouse, the first monocular
dense 3D reconstruction network tailored for laboratory mice. To achieve this
goal, we highlight three key designs. First, we construct the first
high-fidelity dense-view synthetic dataset for mice, by rendering our
self-designed realistic Gaussian mouse avatar. Second, MoReMouse adopts a
transformer-based feedforward architecture with triplane representation,
achieving high-quality 3D surface generation from a single image. Third, we
create geodesic-based continuous correspondence embeddings on mouse surface,
which serve as strong semantic priors to improve reconstruction stability and
surface consistency. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments
demonstrate that MoReMouse significantly outperforms existing open-source
methods in accuracy and robustness. Video results are available at

TL;DR: GSTDS算法通过动态调整训练数据子集，利用预训练模型和光谱分析优化数据选择，显著减少计算需求并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 优化神经网络训练的数据管理，减少冗余计算，提升资源效率和模型性能。

Method: 基于预训练模型和Fiedler向量评分机制，动态过滤数据点，保留最具信息量的样本。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，GSTDS计算需求降低四倍，性能优于现有方法，如JEST。

Conclusion: 光谱数据选择是资源高效深度学习的可行方案，值得进一步探索。

Abstract: Effective data curation is essential for optimizing neural network training.
In this paper, we present the Guided Spectrally Tuned Data Selection (GSTDS)
algorithm, which dynamically adjusts the subset of data points used for
training using an off-the-shelf pre-trained reference model. Based on a
pre-scheduled filtering ratio, GSTDS effectively reduces the number of data
points processed per batch. The proposed method ensures an efficient selection
of the most informative data points for training while avoiding redundant or
less beneficial computations. Preserving data points in each batch is performed
based on spectral analysis. A Fiedler vector-based scoring mechanism removes
the filtered portion of the batch, lightening the resource requirements of the
learning. The proposed data selection approach not only streamlines the
training process but also promotes improved generalization and accuracy.
Extensive experiments on standard image classification benchmarks, including
CIFAR-10, Oxford-IIIT Pet, and Oxford-Flowers, demonstrate that GSTDS
outperforms standard training scenarios and JEST, a recent state-of-the-art
data curation method, on several key factors. It is shown that GSTDS achieves
notable reductions in computational requirements, up to four times, without
compromising performance. GSTDS exhibits a considerable growth in terms of
accuracy under the limited computational resource usage, in contrast to other
methodologies. These promising results underscore the potential of
spectral-based data selection as a scalable solution for resource-efficient
deep learning and motivate further exploration into adaptive data curation
strategies. You can find the code at https://github.com/rezasharifi82/GSTDS.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法依赖大网络和标注数据，难以在资源受限平台上部署。

Result: 在LOL数据集上PSNR达19.04 dB，参数仅0.07%，移动设备上实时处理4K图像。

Conclusion: LiteIE是资源受限平台上高效实用的低光增强解决方案。

Abstract: Real-time low-light image enhancement on mobile and embedded devices requires
models that balance visual quality and computational efficiency. Existing deep
learning methods often rely on large networks and labeled datasets, limiting
their deployment on resource-constrained platforms. In this paper, we propose
LiteIE, an ultra-lightweight unsupervised enhancement framework that eliminates
dependence on large-scale supervision and generalizes well across diverse
conditions. We design a backbone-agnostic feature extractor with only two
convolutional layers to produce compact image features enhancement tensors. In
addition, we develop a parameter-free Iterative Restoration Module, which
reuses the extracted features to progressively recover fine details lost in
earlier enhancement steps, without introducing any additional learnable
parameters. We further propose an unsupervised training objective that
integrates exposure control, edge-aware smoothness, and multi-scale color
consistency losses. Experiments on the LOL dataset, LiteIE achieves 19.04 dB
PSNR, surpassing SOTA by 1.4 dB while using only 0.07\% of its parameters. On a
Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 mobile processor, LiteIE runs at 30 FPS for 4K images with
just 58 parameters, enabling real-time deployment on edge devices. These
results establish LiteIE as an efficient and practical solution for low-light
enhancement on resource-limited platforms.

<details>

Motivation: 现有视频理解基准局限于英语且缺乏深度推理能力，无法满足专业领域（如医学教育）的需求。

Method: M3-Med通过多跳推理任务（结合文本定位、视觉证据查找和跨模态信息合成）设计了两项任务（TAGSV和TAGVC），并评估了多种先进模型。

Result: 所有模型与人类专家之间存在显著性能差距，尤其是在复杂的多跳问题上模型表现大幅下降。

Conclusion: M3-Med揭示了AI模型在专业领域深度跨模态推理中的局限性，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: With the rapid progress of artificial intelligence (AI) in multi-modal
understanding, there is increasing potential for video comprehension
technologies to support professional domains such as medical education.
However, existing benchmarks suffer from two primary limitations: (1)
Linguistic Singularity: they are largely confined to English, neglecting the
need for multilingual resources; and (2) Shallow Reasoning: their questions are
often designed for surface-level information retrieval, failing to properly
assess deep multi-modal integration. To address these limitations, we present
M3-Med, the first benchmark for Multi-lingual, Multi-modal, and Multi-hop
reasoning in Medical instructional video understanding. M3-Med consists of
medical questions paired with corresponding video segments, annotated by a team
of medical experts. A key innovation of M3-Med is its multi-hop reasoning task,
which requires a model to first locate a key entity in the text, then find
corresponding visual evidence in the video, and finally synthesize information
across both modalities to derive the answer. This design moves beyond simple
text matching and poses a substantial challenge to a model's deep cross-modal
understanding capabilities. We define two tasks: Temporal Answer Grounding in
Single Video (TAGSV) and Temporal Answer Grounding in Video Corpus (TAGVC). We
evaluated several state-of-the-art models and Large Language Models (LLMs) on
M3-Med. The results reveal a significant performance gap between all models and
human experts, especially on the complex multi-hop questions where model
performance drops sharply. M3-Med effectively highlights the current
limitations of AI models in deep cross-modal reasoning within specialized
domains and provides a new direction for future research.

Motivation: 扩散模型在视觉生成任务中表现优异，但高计算复杂度限制了其在边缘设备上的应用。现有量化方法在极低比特（2-4位）下性能下降严重。

Method: 提出Flexible Z-Order Residual Mixed Quantization处理异常值，Object-Oriented Low-Rank Initialization优化初始化，以及Memory-based Temporal Relation Distillation保持时间一致性。

Result: MPQ-DMv2在多种生成任务和架构上显著优于现有方法，尤其在极低比特宽度下表现突出。

Conclusion: MPQ-DMv2为极低比特扩散模型提供了一种高效的量化解决方案，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance on vision
generation tasks. However, the high computational complexity hinders its wide
application on edge devices. Quantization has emerged as a promising technique
for inference acceleration and memory reduction. However, existing quantization
methods do not generalize well under extremely low-bit (2-4 bit) quantization.
Directly applying these methods will cause severe performance degradation. We
identify that the existing quantization framework suffers from the
outlier-unfriendly quantizer design, suboptimal initialization, and
optimization strategy. We present MPQ-DMv2, an improved \textbf{M}ixed
\textbf{P}recision \textbf{Q}uantization framework for extremely low-bit
\textbf{D}iffusion \textbf{M}odels. For the quantization perspective, the
imbalanced distribution caused by salient outliers is quantization-unfriendly
for uniform quantizer. We propose \textit{Flexible Z-Order Residual Mixed
Quantization} that utilizes an efficient binary residual branch for flexible
quant steps to handle salient error. For the optimization framework, we
theoretically analyzed the convergence and optimality of the LoRA module and
propose \textit{Object-Oriented Low-Rank Initialization} to use prior
quantization error for informative initialization. We then propose
\textit{Memory-based Temporal Relation Distillation} to construct an online
time-aware pixel queue for long-term denoising temporal information
distillation, which ensures the overall temporal consistency between quantized
and full-precision model. Comprehensive experiments on various generation tasks
show that our MPQ-DMv2 surpasses current SOTA methods by a great margin on
different architectures, especially under extremely low-bit widths.

Motivation: 单域泛化（SDG）面临域偏移大和数据多样性不足的挑战，现有方法难以适应大域偏移。

Method: 提出LEAwareSGD，利用Lyapunov Exponent动态调整学习率，使模型在混沌边缘训练。

Result: 在PACS、OfficeHome和DomainNet上实验，LEAwareSGD显著提升泛化能力，PACS上最高提升9.47%。

Conclusion: 混沌边缘训练能有效提升SDG任务的模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Single Domain Generalization (SDG) aims to develop models capable of
generalizing to unseen target domains using only one source domain, a task
complicated by substantial domain shifts and limited data diversity. Existing
SDG approaches primarily rely on data augmentation techniques, which struggle
to effectively adapt training dynamics to accommodate large domain shifts. To
address this, we propose LEAwareSGD, a novel Lyapunov Exponent (LE)-guided
optimization approach inspired by dynamical systems theory. By leveraging LE
measurements to modulate the learning rate, LEAwareSGD encourages model
training near the edge of chaos, a critical state that optimally balances
stability and adaptability. This dynamic adjustment allows the model to explore
a wider parameter space and capture more generalizable features, ultimately
enhancing the model's generalization capability. Extensive experiments on PACS,
OfficeHome, and DomainNet demonstrate that LEAwareSGD yields substantial
generalization gains, achieving up to 9.47\% improvement on PACS in low-data
regimes. These results underscore the effectiveness of training near the edge
of chaos for enhancing model generalization capability in SDG tasks.

Conclusion: DLCN数据集和Happy-rPPG工具包的发布推动了rPPG在动态夜间光照条件下的研究。

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is a non-contact technique for measuring
human physiological signals. Due to its convenience and non-invasiveness, it
has demonstrated broad application potential in areas such as health monitoring
and emotion recognition. In recent years, the release of numerous public
datasets has significantly advanced the performance of rPPG algorithms under
ideal lighting conditions. However, the effectiveness of current rPPG methods
in realistic nighttime scenarios with dynamic lighting variations remains
largely unknown. Moreover, there is a severe lack of datasets specifically
designed for such challenging environments, which has substantially hindered
progress in this area of research. To address this gap, we present and release
a large-scale rPPG dataset collected under dynamic lighting conditions at
night, named DLCN. The dataset comprises approximately 13 hours of video data
and corresponding synchronized physiological signals from 98 participants,
covering four representative nighttime lighting scenarios. DLCN offers high
diversity and realism, making it a valuable resource for evaluating algorithm
robustness in complex conditions. Built upon the proposed Happy-rPPG Toolkit,
we conduct extensive experiments and provide a comprehensive analysis of the
challenges faced by state-of-the-art rPPG methods when applied to DLCN. The

Motivation: 大气湍流（AT）导致监控图像质量下降，影响目标分类和场景跟踪，现有深度学习方法在失真条件下效果不佳。

Method: 采用3D Mamba结构处理时空失真和模糊，通过金字塔方式提取特征并传递给检测器，优化通过反向传播实现。

Result: DMAT在受湍流影响的测试集上比现有方法性能提升高达15%。

Conclusion: DMAT框架有效解决了AT引起的图像失真问题，提升了目标检测性能。

Abstract: Atmospheric Turbulence (AT) degrades the clarity and accuracy of surveillance
imagery, posing challenges not only for visualization quality but also for
object classification and scene tracking. Deep learning-based methods have been
proposed to improve visual quality, but spatio-temporal distortions remain a
significant issue. Although deep learning-based object detection performs well
under normal conditions, it struggles to operate effectively on sequences
distorted by atmospheric turbulence. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework that learns to compensate for distorted features while simultaneously
improving visualization and object detection. This end-to-end framework
leverages and exchanges knowledge of low-level distorted features in the AT
mitigator with semantic features extracted in the object detector.
Specifically, in the AT mitigator a 3D Mamba-based structure is used to handle
the spatio-temporal displacements and blurring caused by turbulence. Features
are extracted in a pyramid manner during the mitigation stage and passed to the
detector. Optimization is achieved through back-propagation in both the AT
mitigator and object detector. Our proposed DMAT outperforms state-of-the-art
AT mitigation and object detection systems up to a 15% improvement on datasets
corrupted by generated turbulence.

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过图表示和LLM结合，显著提升了医学影像VQA的性能，为临床诊断提供了更可靠的辅助工具。

Abstract: Visual question answering (VQA) in medical imaging aims to support clinical
diagnosis by automatically interpreting complex imaging data in response to
natural language queries. Existing studies typically rely on distinct visual
and textual encoders to independently extract features from medical images and
clinical questions, which are subsequently combined to generate answers.
Specifically, in computed tomography (CT), such approaches are similar to the
conventional practices in medical image analysis. However, these approaches pay
less attention to the spatial continuity and inter-slice correlations in the
volumetric CT data, leading to fragmented and imprecise responses. In this
paper, we propose a novel large language model (LLM)-based framework enhanced
by a graph representation of salient features. Different from conventional
multimodal encoding strategies, our approach constructs a cross-modal graph
integrating both visual and textual features, treating individual CT slices and
question tokens as nodes within the graph. We further leverage an attentive
graph convolutional network to dynamically fuse information within this
structure. The resulting aggregated graph features then serve as a soft prompt
to guide a large language model in generating accurate answers. Extensive
experiments on the M3D-VQA benchmark demonstrate that our approach consistently
outperforms baselines across multiple evaluation metrics, offering more robust
reasoning capabilities.

Motivation: 现有融合策略无法同时实现高效性、长程建模和完整场景信息保留。

Method: 利用状态空间模型（SSMs）和线性注意力的线性复杂度与长程建模能力，提出高度保真LiDAR编码和混合Mamba块。

Result: 在nuScenes验证基准上取得75.0的NDS最高分，超越高分辨率输入方法，且推理速度更快。

Conclusion: 通过高度保真编码和混合Mamba块，实现了高效且高性能的多模态融合。

Abstract: We present the first work demonstrating that a pure Mamba block can achieve
efficient Dense Global Fusion, meanwhile guaranteeing top performance for
camera-LiDAR multi-modal 3D object detection. Our motivation stems from the
observation that existing fusion strategies are constrained by their inability
to simultaneously achieve efficiency, long-range modeling, and retaining
complete scene information. Inspired by recent advances in state-space models
(SSMs) and linear attention, we leverage their linear complexity and long-range
modeling capabilities to address these challenges. However, this is non-trivial
since our experiments reveal that simply adopting efficient linear-complexity
methods does not necessarily yield improvements and may even degrade
performance. We attribute this degradation to the loss of height information
during multi-modal alignment, leading to deviations in sequence order. To
resolve this, we propose height-fidelity LiDAR encoding that preserves precise
height information through voxel compression in continuous space, thereby
enhancing camera-LiDAR alignment. Subsequently, we introduce the Hybrid Mamba
Block, which leverages the enriched height-informed features to conduct local
and global contextual learning. By integrating these components, our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance with the top-tire NDS score of 75.0 on
the nuScenes validation benchmark, even surpassing methods that utilize
high-resolution inputs. Meanwhile, our method maintains efficiency, achieving
faster inference speed than most recent state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 该研究首次利用大规模视觉语言模型规范化墓碑理解，为文化遗产保护提供了新思路。

Abstract: Tombstones are historically and culturally rich artifacts, encapsulating
individual lives, community memory, historical narratives and artistic
expression. Yet, many tombstones today face significant preservation
challenges, including physical erosion, vandalism, environmental degradation,
and political shifts. In this paper, we introduce a novel multi-modal framework
for tombstones digitization, aiming to improve the interpretation, organization
and retrieval of tombstone content. Our approach leverages vision-language
models (VLMs) to translate tombstone images into structured Tombstone Meaning
Representations (TMRs), capturing both image and text information. To further
enrich semantic parsing, we incorporate retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
for integrate externally dependent elements such as toponyms, occupation codes,
and ontological concepts. Compared to traditional OCR-based pipelines, our
method improves parsing accuracy from an F1 score of 36.1 to 89.5. We
additionally evaluate the model's robustness across diverse linguistic and
cultural inscriptions, and simulate physical degradation through image fusion
to assess performance under noisy or damaged conditions. Our work represents
the first attempt to formalize tombstone understanding using large
vision-language models, presenting implications for heritage preservation.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于任务算术框架的方法，将自解释模型的视觉可解释性从源领域迁移到目标领域，提升目标领域的解释质量且不牺牲分类准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自解释模型训练中标注和计算成本高的问题，通过迁移学习实现高效的可解释性迁移。

Method: 扩展基于视觉语言预训练模型的图像分类器，定义可解释性向量，并通过任务算术框架将其应用于目标领域模型。

Result: 实验表明，除部分不相关领域外，视觉可解释性可成功迁移，且在目标领域提升解释质量；可解释性向量在大规模数据集上表现出通用性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且通用，单次推理的解释质量接近需要多次推理的Kernel SHAP。

Abstract: In scenarios requiring both prediction and explanation efficiency for image
classification, self-explaining models that perform both tasks in a single
inference are effective. However, their training incurs substantial labeling
and computational costs. This study aims to tackle the issue by proposing a
method to transfer the visual explainability of self-explaining models, learned
in a source domain, to a target domain based on a task arithmetic framework.
Specifically, we construct a self-explaining model by extending image
classifiers based on a vision-language pretrained model. We then define an
\emph{explainability vector} as the difference between model parameters trained
on the source domain with and without explanation supervision. Based on the
task arithmetic framework, we impart explainability to a model trained only on
the prediction task in the target domain by applying the explainability vector.
Experimental results on various image classification datasets demonstrate that,
except for transfers between some less-related domains, visual explainability
can be successfully transferred from source to target domains, improving
explanation quality in the target domain without sacrificing classification
accuracy. Furthermore, we show that the explainability vector learned on a
large and diverse dataset like ImageNet, extended with explanation supervision,
exhibits universality and robustness, improving explanation quality on nine out
of ten different target datasets. We also find that the explanation quality
achieved with a single model inference is comparable to that of Kernel SHAP,
which requires 150 model inferences.

Motivation: 现有方法仅关注特定层的信息，忽略了决策过程中跨层分布的证据，导致归因不全面。

Method: CoIBA在多目标层中应用信息瓶颈，共享参数阻尼比，并通过变分方法上界层间信息，确保丢弃的激活对决策不必要。

Result: 实验结果表明，CoIBA显著提升了特征归因的忠实性。

Conclusion: CoIBA通过跨层信息共享和变分方法，提供了一种更全面的特征归因方法。

Abstract: The feature attribution method reveals the contribution of input variables to
the decision-making process to provide an attribution map for explanation.
Existing methods grounded on the information bottleneck principle compute
information in a specific layer to obtain attributions, compressing the
features by injecting noise via a parametric damping ratio. However, the
attribution obtained in a specific layer neglects evidence of the
decision-making process distributed across layers. In this paper, we introduce
a comprehensive information bottleneck (CoIBA), which discovers the relevant
information in each targeted layer to explain the decision-making process. Our
core idea is applying information bottleneck in multiple targeted layers to
estimate the comprehensive information by sharing a parametric damping ratio
across the layers. Leveraging this shared ratio complements the over-compressed
information to discover the omitted clues of the decision by sharing the
relevant information across the targeted layers. We suggest the variational
approach to fairly reflect the relevant information of each layer by upper
bounding layer-wise information. Therefore, CoIBA guarantees that the discarded
activation is unnecessary in every targeted layer to make a decision. The
extensive experimental results demonstrate the enhancement in faithfulness of
the feature attributions provided by CoIBA.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于状态空间模型（SSMs）的RegistrationMamba架构，用于解决跨模态遥感图像（CRSI）配准中的非线性辐射变化和纹理限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨模态遥感图像配准面临非线性辐射变化和纹理限制的挑战，现有方法（如CNN和Transformer）各有不足。

Method: 采用多方向交叉扫描策略和多专家特征学习（MEFL）策略，结合多级特征聚合（MFA）模块，提升配准精度。

Result: 实验表明，RegistrationMamba在多种分辨率CRSI上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RegistrationMamba通过全局与局部特征的有效结合，显著提升了配准性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Cross-modal remote sensing image (CRSI) registration is critical for
multi-modal image applications. However, CRSI mainly faces two challenges:
significant nonlinear radiometric variations between cross-modal images and
limited textures hindering the discriminative information extraction. Existing
methods mainly adopt convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or Transformer
architectures to extract discriminative features for registration. However,
CNNs with the local receptive field fail to capture global contextual features,
and Transformers have high computational complexity and restrict their
application to high-resolution CRSI. To solve these issues, this paper proposes
RegistrationMamba, a novel Mamba architecture based on state space models
(SSMs) integrating multi-expert feature learning for improving the accuracy of
CRSI registration. Specifically, RegistrationMamba employs a multi-directional
cross-scanning strategy to capture global contextual relationships with linear
complexity. To enhance the performance of RegistrationMamba under
texture-limited scenarios, we propose a multi-expert feature learning (MEFL)
strategy to capture features from various augmented image variants through
multiple feature experts. MEFL leverages a learnable soft router to dynamically
fuse the features from multiple experts, thereby enriching feature
representations and improving registration performance. Notably, MEFL can be
seamlessly integrated into various frameworks, substantially boosting
registration performance. Additionally, RegistrationMamba integrates a
multi-level feature aggregation (MFA) module to extract fine-grained local
information and enable effective interaction between global and local features.
Extensive experiments on CRSI with varying image resolutions have demonstrated
that RegistrationMamba has superior performance and robustness compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 现有生成方法依赖神经渲染技术，难以在大规模上生成详细的3D结构，主要由于2D观测数据的局限性。

Method: 提出Sat2City框架，包含级联潜在扩散模型、Re-Hash操作和逆采样策略，用于从卫星图像逐步恢复3D城市结构。

Conclusion: Sat2City通过创新方法解决了3D城市生成的细节和规模问题，为游戏、数字孪生等应用提供了新可能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative models have enabled 3D urban scene
generation from satellite imagery, unlocking promising applications in gaming,
digital twins, and beyond. However, most existing methods rely heavily on
neural rendering techniques, which hinder their ability to produce detailed 3D
structures on a broader scale, largely due to the inherent structural ambiguity
derived from relatively limited 2D observations. To address this challenge, we
propose Sat2City, a novel framework that synergizes the representational
capacity of sparse voxel grids with latent diffusion models, tailored
specifically for our novel 3D city dataset. Our approach is enabled by three
key components: (1) A cascaded latent diffusion framework that progressively
recovers 3D city structures from satellite imagery, (2) a Re-Hash operation at
its Variational Autoencoder (VAE) bottleneck to compute multi-scale feature
grids for stable appearance optimization and (3) an inverse sampling strategy
enabling implicit supervision for smooth appearance transitioning.To overcome
the challenge of collecting real-world city-scale 3D models with high-quality
geometry and appearance, we introduce a dataset of synthesized large-scale 3D
cities paired with satellite-view height maps. Validated on this dataset, our
framework generates detailed 3D structures from a single satellite image,
achieving superior fidelity compared to existing city generation models.

<details>

Motivation: 深度估计模型在真实数据上存在泛化问题和训练成本高的问题，尤其在户外无界场景中表现不佳。

Method: 通过结合低层颜色特征和高层蒸馏特征计算视图一致性分布，并采用深度推进损失进行联合正则化。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有NeRF变体和深度正则化方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过视图一致性分布和深度推进损失有效解决了深度估计的局限性，提升了NeRF性能。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has emerged as a compelling framework for scene
representation and 3D recovery. To improve its performance on real-world data,
depth regularizations have proven to be the most effective ones. However, depth
estimation models not only require expensive 3D supervision in training, but
also suffer from generalization issues. As a result, the depth estimations can
be erroneous in practice, especially for outdoor unbounded scenes. In this
paper, we propose to employ view-consistent distributions instead of fixed
depth value estimations to regularize NeRF training. Specifically, the
distribution is computed by utilizing both low-level color features and
high-level distilled features from foundation models at the projected 2D
pixel-locations from per-ray sampled 3D points. By sampling from the
view-consistency distributions, an implicit regularization is imposed on the
training of NeRF. We also utilize a depth-pushing loss that works in
conjunction with the sampling technique to jointly provide effective
regularizations for eliminating the failure modes. Extensive experiments
conducted on various scenes from public datasets demonstrate that our proposed
method can generate significantly better novel view synthesis results than
state-of-the-art NeRF variants as well as different depth regularization
methods.

Conclusion: MVNet展示了处理复杂高光谱数据的强大能力，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification faces challenges such as
high-dimensional data, limited training samples, and spectral redundancy, which
often lead to overfitting and insufficient generalization capability. This
paper proposes a novel MVNet network architecture that integrates 3D-CNN's
local feature extraction, Transformer's global modeling, and Mamba's linear
complexity sequence modeling capabilities, achieving efficient spatial-spectral
feature extraction and fusion. MVNet features a redesigned dual-branch Mamba
module, including a State Space Model (SSM) branch and a non-SSM branch
employing 1D convolution with SiLU activation, enhancing modeling of both
short-range and long-range dependencies while reducing computational latency in
traditional Mamba. The optimized HSI-MambaVision Mixer module overcomes the
unidirectional limitation of causal convolution, capturing bidirectional
spatial-spectral dependencies in a single forward pass through decoupled
attention that focuses on high-value features, alleviating parameter redundancy
and the curse of dimensionality. On IN, UP, and KSC datasets, MVNet outperforms
mainstream hyperspectral image classification methods in both classification
accuracy and computational efficiency, demonstrating robust capability in
processing complex HSI data.

<details>

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注食品类别，缺乏全面的大规模食品基准，且许多食品属性（如甜度、重量）难以通过RGB相机准确感知。

Method: 通过整合现有食品数据集并收集数百种食品的高光谱图像，结合实验仪器测定食品属性，构建了包含3,266个食品类别和2,351k数据点的基准。

Result: 大规模模型在食品数字化方面表现不佳，食品成为最难研究的对象之一；光谱数据对分析食品属性（如甜度）至关重要。

Conclusion: SFOOD基准将开源并持续迭代，以促进智能食品分析的发展。

Abstract: With the rise and development of computer vision and LLMs, intelligence is
everywhere, especially for people and cars. However, for tremendous food
attributes (such as origin, quantity, weight, quality, sweetness, etc.),
existing research still mainly focuses on the study of categories. The reason
is the lack of a large and comprehensive benchmark for food. Besides, many food
attributes (such as sweetness, weight, and fine-grained categories) are
challenging to accurately percept solely through RGB cameras. To fulfill this
gap and promote the development of intelligent food analysis, in this paper, we
built the first large-scale spectral food (SFOOD) benchmark suite. We spent a
lot of manpower and equipment costs to organize existing food datasets and
collect hyperspectral images of hundreds of foods, and we used instruments to
experimentally determine food attributes such as sweetness and weight. The
resulting benchmark consists of 3,266 food categories and 2,351 k data points
for 17 main food categories. Extensive evaluations find that: (i) Large-scale
models are still poor at digitizing food. Compared to people and cars, food has
gradually become one of the most difficult objects to study; (ii) Spectrum data
are crucial for analyzing food properties (such as sweetness). Our benchmark
will be open source and continuously iterated for different food analysis
tasks.

Conclusion: DreamVLA通过整合全面的世界知识预测和解耦表示，显著提升了机器人操作的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown promise in
integrating image generation with action prediction to improve generalization
and reasoning in robot manipulation. However, existing methods are limited to
challenging image-based forecasting, which suffers from redundant information
and lacks comprehensive and critical world knowledge, including dynamic,
spatial and semantic information. To address these limitations, we propose
DreamVLA, a novel VLA framework that integrates comprehensive world knowledge
forecasting to enable inverse dynamics modeling, thereby establishing a
perception-prediction-action loop for manipulation tasks. Specifically,
DreamVLA introduces a dynamic-region-guided world knowledge prediction,
integrated with the spatial and semantic cues, which provide compact yet
comprehensive representations for action planning. This design aligns with how
humans interact with the world by first forming abstract multimodal reasoning
chains before acting. To mitigate interference among the dynamic, spatial and
semantic information during training, we adopt a block-wise structured
attention mechanism that masks their mutual attention, preventing information
leakage and keeping each representation clean and disentangled. Moreover, to
model the conditional distribution over future actions, we employ a
diffusion-based transformer that disentangles action representations from
shared latent features. Extensive experiments on both real-world and simulation
environments demonstrate that DreamVLA achieves 76.7% success rate on real
robot tasks and 4.44 average length on the CALVIN ABC-D benchmarks.

Motivation: 当前文本到图像生成模型在复杂场景中难以实现输入文本与空间组合的对齐，布局规划与生成过程脱节导致空间控制效果不佳。

Method: CoT-Diff框架在扩散过程中嵌入MLLM驱动的3D布局规划，通过动态更新布局并转换为语义条件和深度图，利用条件感知注意力机制指导生成。

Result: 在3D场景基准测试中，CoT-Diff显著提升了空间对齐和组合保真度，复杂场景空间准确率比现有最佳方法高34.7%。

Conclusion: CoT-Diff通过紧密耦合布局规划与生成过程，验证了这种纠缠生成范式的有效性。

Abstract: Current text-to-image (T2I) generation models struggle to align spatial
composition with the input text, especially in complex scenes. Even
layout-based approaches yield suboptimal spatial control, as their generation
process is decoupled from layout planning, making it difficult to refine the
layout during synthesis. We present CoT-Diff, a framework that brings
step-by-step CoT-style reasoning into T2I generation by tightly integrating
Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-driven 3D layout planning with the
diffusion process. CoT-Diff enables layout-aware reasoning inline within a
single diffusion round: at each denoising step, the MLLM evaluates intermediate
predictions, dynamically updates the 3D scene layout, and continuously guides
the generation process. The updated layout is converted into semantic
conditions and depth maps, which are fused into the diffusion model via a
condition-aware attention mechanism, enabling precise spatial control and
semantic injection. Experiments on 3D Scene benchmarks show that CoT-Diff
significantly improves spatial alignment and compositional fidelity, and
outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 34.7% in complex scene spatial
accuracy, thereby validating the effectiveness of this entangled generation
paradigm.

Result: BiVM在计算和存储成本上分别节省14.3倍和21.6倍，性能优于现有二值化方法。

Conclusion: BiVM通过优化编码器和解码器设计，显著提升了二值化视频抠图的精度和效率。

Abstract: Deep neural networks for real-time video matting suffer significant
computational limitations on edge devices, hindering their adoption in
widespread applications such as online conferences and short-form video
production. Binarization emerges as one of the most common compression
approaches with compact 1-bit parameters and efficient bitwise operations.
However, accuracy and efficiency limitations exist in the binarized video
matting network due to its degenerated encoder and redundant decoder. Following
a theoretical analysis based on the information bottleneck principle, the
limitations are mainly caused by the degradation of prediction-relevant
information in the intermediate features and the redundant computation in
prediction-irrelevant areas. We present BiVM, an accurate and
resource-efficient Binarized neural network for Video Matting. First, we
present a series of binarized computation structures with elastic shortcuts and
evolvable topologies, enabling the constructed encoder backbone to extract
high-quality representation from input videos for accurate prediction. Second,
we sparse the intermediate feature of the binarized decoder by masking
homogeneous parts, allowing the decoder to focus on representation with diverse
details while alleviating the computation burden for efficient inference.
Furthermore, we construct a localized binarization-aware mimicking framework
with the information-guided strategy, prompting matting-related representation
in full-precision counterparts to be accurately and fully utilized.
Comprehensive experiments show that the proposed BiVM surpasses alternative
binarized video matting networks, including state-of-the-art (SOTA)
binarization methods, by a substantial margin. Moreover, our BiVM achieves
significant savings of 14.3x and 21.6x in computation and storage costs,
respectively. We also evaluate BiVM on ARM CPU hardware.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of deep learning (DL) models and the ever-increasing size
of available datasets have raised the interest of the research community in the
always important field of vision-based hand gesture recognition (VHGR), and
delivered a wide range of applications, such as sign language understanding and
human-computer interaction using cameras. Despite the large volume of research
works in the field, a structured and complete survey on VHGR is still missing,
leaving researchers to navigate through hundreds of papers in order to find the
right combination of data, model, and approach for each task. The current
survey aims to fill this gap by presenting a comprehensive overview of this
aspect of computer vision. With a systematic research methodology that
identifies the state-of-the-art works and a structured presentation of the
various methods, datasets, and evaluation metrics, this review aims to
constitute a useful guideline for researchers, helping them to choose the right
strategy for delving into a certain VHGR task. Starting with the methodology
used for study selection, literature retrieval, and the analytical framing, the
survey identifies and organizes key VHGR approaches using a taxonomy-based
format in various dimensions such as input modality and application domain. The
core of the survey provides an in-depth analysis of state-of-the-art techniques
across three primary VHGR tasks: static gesture recognition, isolated dynamic
gestures and continuous gesture recognition. For each task, the architectural
trends and learning strategies are listed. Additionally, the study reviews
commonly used datasets - emphasizing on annotation schemes - and evaluates
standard performance metrics. It concludes by identifying major challenges in
VHGR, including both general computer vision issues and domain-specific
obstacles, and outlines promising directions for future research.

Abstract: We present a training-free framework for style-personalized image generation
that controls content and style information during inference using a scale-wise
autoregressive model. Our method employs a three-path design--content, style,
and generation--each guided by a corresponding text prompt, enabling flexible
and efficient control over image semantics without any additional training. A
central contribution of this work is a step-wise and attention-wise
intervention analysis. Through systematic prompt and feature injection, we find
that early-to-middle generation steps play a pivotal role in shaping both
content and style, and that query features predominantly encode
content-specific information. Guided by these insights, we introduce two
targeted mechanisms: Key Stage Attention Sharing, which aligns content and
style during the semantically critical steps, and Adaptive Query Sharing, which
reinforces content semantics in later steps through similarity-aware query
blending. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
competitive style fidelity and prompt fidelity compared to fine-tuned
baselines, while offering faster inference and greater deployment flexibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市环境中建筑物和施工场地会显著降低GNSS信号质量，因此需要视觉定位技术作为补充。

Conclusion: U-ViLAR框架通过平衡粗粒度与细粒度定位能力，实现了鲁棒且精确的定位。

Abstract: Accurate localization using visual information is a critical yet challenging
task, especially in urban environments where nearby buildings and construction
sites significantly degrade GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) signal
quality. This issue underscores the importance of visual localization
techniques in scenarios where GNSS signals are unreliable. This paper proposes
U-ViLAR, a novel uncertainty-aware visual localization framework designed to
address these challenges while enabling adaptive localization using
high-definition (HD) maps or navigation maps. Specifically, our method first
extracts features from the input visual data and maps them into Bird's-Eye-View
(BEV) space to enhance spatial consistency with the map input. Subsequently, we
introduce: a) Perceptual Uncertainty-guided Association, which mitigates errors
caused by perception uncertainty, and b) Localization Uncertainty-guided
Registration, which reduces errors introduced by localization uncertainty. By
effectively balancing the coarse-grained large-scale localization capability of
association with the fine-grained precise localization capability of
registration, our approach achieves robust and accurate localization.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance across multiple localization tasks. Furthermore, our model has
undergone rigorous testing on large-scale autonomous driving fleets and has
demonstrated stable performance in various challenging urban scenarios.

TL;DR: MVL-Loc是一个新颖的多场景6自由度相机重定位框架，利用视觉语言模型和自然语言指导，在室内外环境中实现鲁棒性和泛化性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于深度学习的单场景相机位姿回归方法在多样化环境中缺乏泛化性和鲁棒性，MVL-Loc旨在解决这一问题。

Method: MVL-Loc结合预训练的视觉语言模型和多模态数据，利用自然语言指导多场景学习过程，增强语义理解和空间关系捕捉。

Result: 在7Scenes和Cambridge Landmarks数据集上的实验表明，MVL-Loc在多场景相机重定位中表现出鲁棒性和最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MVL-Loc通过结合视觉语言模型和自然语言指导，显著提升了相机重定位的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Camera relocalization, a cornerstone capability of modern computer vision,
accurately determines a camera's position and orientation (6-DoF) from images
and is essential for applications in augmented reality (AR), mixed reality
(MR), autonomous driving, delivery drones, and robotic navigation. Unlike
traditional deep learning-based methods that regress camera pose from images in
a single scene, which often lack generalization and robustness in diverse
environments, we propose MVL-Loc, a novel end-to-end multi-scene 6-DoF camera
relocalization framework. MVL-Loc leverages pretrained world knowledge from
vision-language models (VLMs) and incorporates multimodal data to generalize
across both indoor and outdoor settings. Furthermore, natural language is
employed as a directive tool to guide the multi-scene learning process,
facilitating semantic understanding of complex scenes and capturing spatial
relationships among objects. Extensive experiments on the 7Scenes and Cambridge
Landmarks datasets demonstrate MVL-Loc's robustness and state-of-the-art
performance in real-world multi-scene camera relocalization, with improved
accuracy in both positional and orientational estimates.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于CLIP的框架FA，通过强制提示学习充分利用ID知识提升OOD检测效果，无需外部数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CLIP方法依赖外部数据或泛化能力有限，FA旨在通过ID知识改进OOD检测。

Method: 学习包含ID类多样化描述的强制提示，并通过强制系数优化描述。

Result: FA显著提升OOD检测性能，无需外部数据且参数与CoOp相同。

Conclusion: FA在OOD检测中优于现有方法，代码已开源。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced out-of-distribution
(OOD) detection recently. However, existing CLIP-based methods often focus on
learning OOD-related knowledge to improve OOD detection, showing limited
generalization or reliance on external large-scale auxiliary datasets. In this
study, instead of delving into the intricate OOD-related knowledge, we propose
an innovative CLIP-based framework based on Forced prompt leArning (FA),
designed to make full use of the In-Distribution (ID) knowledge and ultimately
boost the effectiveness of OOD detection. Our key insight is to learn a prompt
(i.e., forced prompt) that contains more diversified and richer descriptions of
the ID classes beyond the textual semantics of class labels. Specifically, it
promotes better discernment for ID images, by forcing more notable semantic
similarity between ID images and the learnable forced prompt. Moreover, we
introduce a forced coefficient, encouraging the forced prompt to learn more
comprehensive and nuanced descriptions of the ID classes. In this way, FA is
capable of achieving notable improvements in OOD detection, even when trained
without any external auxiliary datasets, while maintaining an identical number
of trainable parameters as CoOp. Extensive empirical evaluations confirm our
method consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. Code is

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合空间基础和上下文感知的手势生成框架，填补了现有研究中手势生成与环境基础分离的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型通常专注于描述性运动生成或孤立的手势合成，缺乏对空间基础和上下文感知的结合，限制了具身交互代理的发展。

Method: 论文引入了一个多模态数据集和框架，结合了合成数据集和VR数据集，提供了同步的运动、语音和3D场景信息，并与物理模拟器连接。

Result: 提供了超过7.7小时的标准化数据，为空间基础手势生成和具身交互研究奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 通过结合手势建模和空间基础，论文为具身手势生成和多模态交互研究提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Human motion generation has advanced rapidly in recent years, yet the
critical problem of creating spatially grounded, context-aware gestures has
been largely overlooked. Existing models typically specialize either in
descriptive motion generation, such as locomotion and object interaction, or in
isolated co-speech gesture synthesis aligned with utterance semantics. However,
both lines of work often treat motion and environmental grounding separately,
limiting advances toward embodied, communicative agents. To address this gap,
our work introduces a multimodal dataset and framework for grounded gesture
generation, combining two key resources: (1) a synthetic dataset of spatially
grounded referential gestures, and (2) MM-Conv, a VR-based dataset capturing
two-party dialogues. Together, they provide over 7.7 hours of synchronized
motion, speech, and 3D scene information, standardized in the HumanML3D format.
Our framework further connects to a physics-based simulator, enabling synthetic
data generation and situated evaluation. By bridging gesture modeling and
spatial grounding, our contribution establishes a foundation for advancing
research in situated gesture generation and grounded multimodal interaction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界数据收集偏向常见场景和对象，导致新颖事件代表性不足，影响模型泛化能力和安全性。

Method: 使用动态Mean Shift算法为图像帧分配数据驱动的新颖性分数，基于均值和协方差统计建模正常内容，识别并丢弃冗余帧。

Result: 通过减少训练数据集大小，模型性能得到提升；数据冗余增加时，更激进的过滤方法更有效。

Conclusion: 该方法支持实时部署，能持续更新正常内容定义，高效检测连续数据流中的新颖性。

Abstract: High-quality datasets are essential for training robust perception systems in
autonomous driving. However, real-world data collection is often biased toward
common scenes and objects, leaving novel cases underrepresented. This imbalance
hinders model generalization and compromises safety. The core issue is the
curse of rarity. Over time, novel events occur infrequently, and standard
logging methods fail to capture them effectively. As a result, large volumes of
redundant data are stored, while critical novel cases are diluted, leading to
biased datasets. This work presents a real-time data selection method focused
on object-level novelty detection to build more balanced and diverse datasets.
The method assigns a data-driven novelty score to image frames using a novel
dynamic Mean Shift algorithm. It models normal content based on mean and
covariance statistics to identify frames with novel objects, discarding those
with redundant elements. The main findings show that reducing the training
dataset size with this method can improve model performance, whereas higher
redundancy tends to degrade it. Moreover, as data redundancy increases, more
aggressive filtering becomes both possible and beneficial. While random
sampling can offer some gains, it often leads to overfitting and
unpredictability in outcomes. The proposed method supports real-time deployment
with 32 frames per second and is constant over time. By continuously updating
the definition of normal content, it enables efficient detection of novelties
in a continuous data stream.

Abstract: Discrete video tokenization is essential for efficient autoregressive

introduces a state-of-the-art discrete video tokenizer with two key
contributions. First, we propose a novel Mamba-based encoder-decoder
architecture that overcomes the limitations of previous sequencebased
tokenizers. Second, we introduce a new quantization scheme, channel-split
quantization, which significantly enhances the representational power of
quantized latents while preserving the token count. Our model sets a new
state-of-the-art, outperforming both causal 3D convolutionbased and
Transformer-based approaches across multiple datasets. Experimental results
further demonstrate its robustness as a tokenizer for autoregressive video
generation.

Motivation: 现有扩散模型在细粒度编辑任务（如人脸编辑）中存在身份信息丢失、高频细节缺失或无关区域被修改的问题，需要一种更精确的编辑方法。

Method: S²Edit通过微调预训练模型，将身份信息嵌入可学习的文本标记，并在文本特征空间中施加正交约束以解耦身份与待编辑属性，同时使用对象掩码引导注意力图以实现局部编辑。

Result: 实验表明，S²Edit在定量和定性上均优于现有方法，并展示了其在组合图像编辑（如妆容迁移）中的应用潜力。

Conclusion: S²Edit通过解耦和局部化身份标记，实现了高保真度的细粒度编辑，为扩散模型在图像编辑任务中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have enabled high-quality generation and
manipulation of images guided by texts, as well as concept learning from
images. However, naive applications of existing methods to editing tasks that
require fine-grained control, e.g., face editing, often lead to suboptimal
solutions with identity information and high-frequency details lost during the
editing process, or irrelevant image regions altered due to entangled concepts.
In this work, we propose S$^2$Edit, a novel method based on a pre-trained
text-to-image diffusion model that enables personalized editing with precise
semantic and spatial control. We first fine-tune our model to embed the
identity information into a learnable text token. During fine-tuning, we
disentangle the learned identity token from attributes to be edited by
enforcing an orthogonality constraint in the textual feature space. To ensure
that the identity token only affects regions of interest, we apply object masks
to guide the cross-attention maps. At inference time, our method performs
localized editing while faithfully preserving the original identity with
semantically disentangled and spatially focused identity token learned.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of S$^2$Edit over
state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. Additionally,
we showcase several compositional image editing applications of S$^2$Edit such
as makeup transfer.

Conclusion: CVFusion通过跨视图融合和多阶段优化，显著提升了4D雷达的3D目标检测性能。

Abstract: 4D radar has received significant attention in autonomous driving thanks to
its robustness under adverse weathers. Due to the sparse points and noisy
measurements of the 4D radar, most of the research finish the 3D object
detection task by integrating images from camera and perform modality fusion in
BEV space. However, the potential of the radar and the fusion mechanism is
still largely unexplored, hindering the performance improvement. In this study,
we propose a cross-view two-stage fusion network called CVFusion. In the first
stage, we design a radar guided iterative (RGIter) BEV fusion module to
generate high-recall 3D proposal boxes. In the second stage, we aggregate
features from multiple heterogeneous views including points, image, and BEV for
each proposal. These comprehensive instance level features greatly help refine
the proposals and generate high-quality predictions. Extensive experiments on
public datasets show that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art
methods by a large margin, with 9.10% and 3.68% mAP improvements on
View-of-Delft (VoD) and TJ4DRadSet, respectively. Our code will be made

Conclusion: 研究为多模态嵌入模型的通用性和统一学习策略提供了见解，为研究和实际应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Multimodal embedding models have been crucial in enabling various downstream
tasks such as semantic similarity, information retrieval, and clustering over
different modalities. However, existing multimodal embeddings like VLM2Vec,
E5-V, GME are predominantly focused on natural images, with limited support for
other visual forms such as videos and visual documents. This restricts their
applicability in real-world scenarios, including AI agents, multi-modal search
and recommendation, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). To close this
gap, we propose VLM2Vec-V2, a unified framework for learning embeddings across
diverse visual forms. First, we introduce MMEB-V2, a comprehensive benchmark
that extends MMEB with five new task types: visual document retrieval, video
retrieval, temporal grounding, video classification and video question
answering - spanning text, image, video, and visual document inputs. Next, we
train VLM2Vec-V2, a general-purpose embedding model that supports text, image,
video, and visual document inputs. Extensive experiments show that VLM2Vec-V2
achieves strong performance not only on the newly introduced video and document
retrieval tasks, but also improves over prior baselines on the original image
benchmarks. Through extensive evaluation, our study offers insights into the
generalizability of various multimodal embedding models and highlights
effective strategies for unified embedding learning, laying the groundwork for
more scalable and adaptable representation learning in both research and
real-world settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型在结合多个LoRA模型时，常因权重矩阵的非结构化修改导致内容与风格属性纠缠，影响效果。

Method: 利用QR分解，固定Q和R矩阵，仅训练额外的任务特定ΔR矩阵，实现结构化参数更新。

Result: QR-LoRA在内容-风格融合任务中表现出优异的解耦能力，参数数量仅为传统LoRA方法的一半。

Conclusion: QR-LoRA为生成模型提供了一种参数高效、解耦的微调新范式。

Abstract: Existing text-to-image models often rely on parameter fine-tuning techniques
such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to customize visual attributes. However,
when combining multiple LoRA models for content-style fusion tasks,
unstructured modifications of weight matrices often lead to undesired feature
entanglement between content and style attributes. We propose QR-LoRA, a novel
fine-tuning framework leveraging QR decomposition for structured parameter
updates that effectively separate visual attributes. Our key insight is that
the orthogonal Q matrix naturally minimizes interference between different
visual features, while the upper triangular R matrix efficiently encodes
attribute-specific transformations. Our approach fixes both Q and R matrices
while only training an additional task-specific $\Delta R$ matrix. This
structured design reduces trainable parameters to half of conventional LoRA
methods and supports effective merging of multiple adaptations without
cross-contamination due to the strong disentanglement properties between
$\Delta R$ matrices. Experiments demonstrate that QR-LoRA achieves superior
disentanglement in content-style fusion tasks, establishing a new paradigm for
parameter-efficient, disentangled fine-tuning in generative models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖稀疏的切片级标签，且仅使用简单的语言提示和余弦相似性，无法学习细粒度的视觉语言对齐，同时忽略了WSI的层次结构。

Method: HiLa框架使用预训练特征提取器生成分层的视觉特征，并通过最优提示学习（OPL）将多层次的语言提示与视觉特征对齐，同时引入跨层传播（CLP）和互对比学习（MCL）模块。

Result: 在三个TCGA数据集上实现了SOTA性能。

Conclusion: HiLa通过分层视觉语言协作显著提升了生存预测性能。

Abstract: Survival prediction using whole-slide images (WSIs) is crucial in cancer
re-search. Despite notable success, existing approaches are limited by their
reliance on sparse slide-level labels, which hinders the learning of
discriminative repre-sentations from gigapixel WSIs. Recently, vision language
(VL) models, which incorporate additional language supervision, have emerged as
a promising solu-tion. However, VL-based survival prediction remains largely
unexplored due to two key challenges. First, current methods often rely on only
one simple lan-guage prompt and basic cosine similarity, which fails to learn
fine-grained associ-ations between multi-faceted linguistic information and
visual features within WSI, resulting in inadequate vision-language alignment.
Second, these methods primarily exploit patch-level information, overlooking
the intrinsic hierarchy of WSIs and their interactions, causing ineffective
modeling of hierarchical interac-tions. To tackle these problems, we propose a
novel Hierarchical vision-Language collaboration (HiLa) framework for improved
survival prediction. Specifically, HiLa employs pretrained feature extractors
to generate hierarchical visual features from WSIs at both patch and region
levels. At each level, a series of language prompts describing various
survival-related attributes are constructed and aligned with visual features
via Optimal Prompt Learning (OPL). This ap-proach enables the comprehensive
learning of discriminative visual features cor-responding to different
survival-related attributes from prompts, thereby improv-ing vision-language
alignment. Furthermore, we introduce two modules, i.e., Cross-Level Propagation
(CLP) and Mutual Contrastive Learning (MCL) to maximize hierarchical
cooperation by promoting interactions and consistency be-tween patch and region
levels. Experiments on three TCGA datasets demonstrate our SOTA performance.

Result: 实验显示模型性能显著提升，训练成本减半。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了误导性标注问题，提升了3D VQA任务的效率和准确性。

Abstract: 3D Visual Question Answering (3D VQA) is crucial for enabling models to
perceive the physical world and perform spatial reasoning. In 3D VQA, the
free-form nature of answers often leads to improper annotations that can
confuse or mislead models when training on the entire dataset. While other text
generation tasks can mitigate this issue by learning on large-scale datasets,
the scarcity of 3D scene data enlarges the negative effect of misleading
annotations. Although active learning strategies can select valuable instances
for training, they fail to identify and resolve misleading labels, which the
oracle inevitably provides in practice. To address this issue, we propose a
multi-turn interactive active learning strategy. This strategy selects data
based on models' semantic uncertainty to form a solid knowledge foundation more
effectively and actively requests reannotation from an oracle to resolve
potentially misleading labels. For uncertainty assessment, we utilize a
variance-based metric that takes semantic relationships between terms into
consideration, thus avoiding the uniform inter-class similarity assumption of
previous assessment metrics. Extensive experiments exhibit better model
performance and a substantial reduction in training costs, with a halving of
training costs for achieving relatively high accuracy. The code is available at

Conclusion: SMoEStereo通过高效融合VFMs，显著提升了立体匹配的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Recently, learning-based stereo matching networks have advanced
significantly. However, they often lack robustness and struggle to achieve
impressive cross-domain performance due to domain shifts and imbalanced
disparity distributions among diverse datasets. Leveraging Vision Foundation
Models (VFMs) can intuitively enhance the model's robustness, but integrating
such a model into stereo matching cost-effectively to fully realize their
robustness remains a key challenge. To address this, we propose SMoEStereo, a
novel framework that adapts VFMs for stereo matching through a tailored,
scene-specific fusion of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) modules. SMoEStereo introduces MoE-LoRA with adaptive ranks and
MoE-Adapter with adaptive kernel sizes. The former dynamically selects optimal
experts within MoE to adapt varying scenes across domains, while the latter
injects inductive bias into frozen VFMs to improve geometric feature
extraction. Importantly, to mitigate computational overhead, we further propose
a lightweight decision network that selectively activates MoE modules based on
input complexity, balancing efficiency with accuracy. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method exhibits state-of-the-art cross-domain and joint
generalization across multiple benchmarks without dataset-specific adaptation.

Method: 提出LTMSformer框架，包括局部趋势感知注意力机制、运动状态编码器和轻量级提议细化模块。

Result: 在Argoverse 1数据集上，性能优于基线HiVT-64，minADE降低4.35%，minFDE降低8.74%，MR降低20%。

Conclusion: LTMSformer在减少模型规模的同时，显著提升了轨迹预测的准确性。

Abstract: It has been challenging to model the complex temporal-spatial dependencies
between agents for trajectory prediction. As each state of an agent is closely
related to the states of adjacent time steps, capturing the local temporal
dependency is beneficial for prediction, while most studies often overlook it.
Besides, learning the high-order motion state attributes is expected to enhance
spatial interaction modeling, but it is rarely seen in previous works. To
address this, we propose a lightweight framework, LTMSformer, to extract
temporal-spatial interaction features for multi-modal trajectory prediction.
Specifically, we introduce a Local Trend-Aware Attention mechanism to capture
the local temporal dependency by leveraging a convolutional attention mechanism
with hierarchical local time boxes. Next, to model the spatial interaction
dependency, we build a Motion State Encoder to incorporate high-order motion
state attributes, such as acceleration, jerk, heading, etc. To further refine
the trajectory prediction, we propose a Lightweight Proposal Refinement Module
that leverages Multi-Layer Perceptrons for trajectory embedding and generates
the refined trajectories with fewer model parameters. Experiment results on the
Argoverse 1 dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline
HiVT-64, reducing the minADE by approximately 4.35%, the minFDE by 8.74%, and
the MR by 20%. We also achieve higher accuracy than HiVT-128 with a 68%

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注语言为中心的调整，而忽视了多模态令牌的混合，导致在需要细粒度认知和情感理解的高层次任务中存在挑战。

Method: MODA采用双模态空间映射和自适应掩码注意力策略，实现模态对齐和跨层令牌混合的解耦。

Result: 在21个基准数据集上的实验验证了MODA在感知、认知和情感任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: MODA通过创新的注意力机制显著提升了多模态模型的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) recently showed strong capacity in
integrating data among multiple modalities, empowered by a generalizable
attention architecture. Advanced methods predominantly focus on
language-centric tuning while less exploring multimodal tokens mixed through
attention, posing challenges in high-level tasks that require fine-grained
cognition and emotion understanding. In this work, we identify the attention
deficit disorder problem in multimodal learning, caused by inconsistent
cross-modal attention and layer-by-layer decayed attention activation. To
address this, we propose a novel attention mechanism, termed MOdular Duplex
Attention (MODA), simultaneously conducting the inner-modal refinement and
inter-modal interaction. MODA employs a correct-after-align strategy to
effectively decouple modality alignment from cross-layer token mixing. In the
alignment phase, tokens are mapped to duplex modality spaces based on the basis
vectors, enabling the interaction between visual and language modality.
Further, the correctness of attention scores is ensured through adaptive masked
attention, which enhances the model's flexibility by allowing customizable
masking patterns for different modalities. Extensive experiments on 21
benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of MODA in perception, cognition,
and emotion tasks. Source code and demo are available in

<details>

Method: UGG-ReID采用高斯补丁图表示模型量化局部线索，并设计不确定性引导的专家混合策略动态分配样本。

Result: 在五个多模态对象ReID数据集上表现优异，尤其在抗噪性方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: UGG-ReID通过不确定性建模和多模态交互增强，显著提升了鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Multi-modal object Re-IDentification (ReID) has gained considerable attention
with the goal of retrieving specific targets across cameras using heterogeneous
visual data sources. Existing methods primarily aim to improve identification
performance, but often overlook the uncertainty arising from inherent defects,
such as intra-modal noise and inter-modal conflicts. This uncertainty is
particularly significant in the case of fine-grained local occlusion and frame
loss, which becomes a challenge in multi-modal learning. To address the above
challenge, we propose a robust approach named Uncertainty-Guided Graph model
for multi-modal object ReID (UGG-ReID). UGG-ReID is designed to mitigate noise
interference and facilitate effective multi-modal fusion by estimating both
local and sample-level aleatoric uncertainty and explicitly modeling their
dependencies. Specifically, we first propose the Gaussian patch-graph
representation model that leverages uncertainty to quantify fine-grained local
cues and capture their structural relationships. This process boosts the
expressiveness of modal-specific information, ensuring that the generated
embeddings are both more informative and robust. Subsequently, we design an
uncertainty-guided mixture of experts strategy that dynamically routes samples
to experts exhibiting low uncertainty. This strategy effectively suppresses
noise-induced instability, leading to enhanced robustness. Meanwhile, we design
an uncertainty-guided routing to strengthen the multi-modal interaction,
improving the performance. UGG-ReID is comprehensively evaluated on five
representative multi-modal object ReID datasets, encompassing diverse spectral
modalities. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves
excellent performance on all datasets and is significantly better than current
methods in terms of noise immunity. Our code will be made public upon
acceptance.

TL;DR: VectorLLM是一种多模态大语言模型，用于直接从遥感图像中提取建筑物轮廓，通过点对点回归方法显著优于现有方法，并展现出强大的零样本泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖复杂的多阶段流程，限制了可扩展性和实际应用。VectorLLM旨在利用大语言模型的推理能力，简化流程并提高性能。

Method: VectorLLM采用视觉基础主干、MLP连接器和LLM架构，结合可学习的位置嵌入，通过预训练、监督微调和偏好优化进行训练。

Result: 在WHU、WHU-Mix和CrowdAI数据集上，VectorLLM分别比现有方法提升了5.6、7.1和13.6 AP，并在零样本任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: VectorLLM为遥感图像中的矢量提取建立了新范式，结合高精度和泛化能力，推动了社区发展。

Abstract: Automatically extracting vectorized building contours from remote sensing
imagery is crucial for urban planning, population estimation, and disaster
assessment. Current state-of-the-art methods rely on complex multi-stage
pipelines involving pixel segmentation, vectorization, and polygon refinement,
which limits their scalability and real-world applicability. Inspired by the
remarkable reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce
VectorLLM, the first Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) designed for
regular building contour extraction from remote sensing images. Unlike existing
approaches, VectorLLM performs corner-point by corner-point regression of
building contours directly, mimicking human annotators' labeling process. Our
architecture consists of a vision foundation backbone, an MLP connector, and an
LLM, enhanced with learnable position embeddings to improve spatial
understanding capability. Through comprehensive exploration of training
strategies including pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, and preference
optimization across WHU, WHU-Mix, and CrowdAI datasets, VectorLLM significantly
outperformed the previous SOTA methods by 5.6 AP, 7.1 AP, 13.6 AP, respectively
in the three datasets. Remarkably, VectorLLM exhibits strong zero-shot
performance on unseen objects including aircraft, water bodies, and oil tanks,
highlighting its potential for unified modeling of diverse remote sensing
object contour extraction tasks. Overall, this work establishes a new paradigm
for vector extraction in remote sensing, leveraging the topological reasoning
capabilities of LLMs to achieve both high accuracy and exceptional
generalization. All the codes and weights will be published for promoting
community development.

TL;DR: AVATAR提出了一种视频中心的音频-视觉定位（AVL）基准，解决了现有方法在捕捉时间动态和复杂场景上的不足，并提出了TAVLO模型，通过高分辨率时间建模实现更精确的定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AVL研究局限于图像级关联，忽略了时间动态，且假设场景过于简化（如单一可见声源）。

Method: 提出AVATAR基准，包含四种场景（单声、混合声、多实体、屏外），并开发TAVLO模型，整合时间信息。

Result: 传统方法因依赖全局音频特征和帧级映射而表现不佳，TAVLO通过时间建模实现了更鲁棒的定位。

Conclusion: 时间动态对AVL至关重要，AVATAR和TAVLO为视频中心AVL设立了新标准。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Localization (AVL) aims to identify sound-emitting sources
within a visual scene. However, existing studies focus on image-level
audio-visual associations, failing to capture temporal dynamics. Moreover, they
assume simplified scenarios where sound sources are always visible and involve
only a single object. To address these limitations, we propose AVATAR, a
video-centric AVL benchmark that incorporates high-resolution temporal
information. AVATAR introduces four distinct scenarios -- Single-sound,
Mixed-sound, Multi-entity, and Off-screen -- enabling a more comprehensive
evaluation of AVL models. Additionally, we present TAVLO, a novel video-centric
AVL model that explicitly integrates temporal information. Experimental results
show that conventional methods struggle to track temporal variations due to
their reliance on global audio features and frame-level mappings. In contrast,
TAVLO achieves robust and precise audio-visual alignment by leveraging
high-resolution temporal modeling. Our work empirically demonstrates the
importance of temporal dynamics in AVL and establishes a new standard for
video-centric audio-visual localization.

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative methods, especially diffusion models, have
made great progress in remote sensing image synthesis. Despite these
advancements, existing methods have not explored the simulation of future
scenarios based on given scenario images. This simulation capability has wide
applications for urban planning, land managementChangeBridge: Spatiotemporal
Image Generation with Multimodal Controls, and beyond. In this work, we propose
ChangeBridge, a conditional spatiotemporal diffusion model. Given pre-event
images and conditioned on multimodal spatial controls (e.g., text prompts,
instance layouts, and semantic maps), ChangeBridge can synthesize post-event
images. The core idea behind ChangeBridge is to modeling the noise-to-image
diffusion model, as a pre-to-post diffusion bridge. Conditioned on multimodal
controls, ChangeBridge leverages a stochastic Brownian-bridge diffusion,
directly modeling the spatiotemporal evolution between pre-event and post-event
states. To the best of our knowledge, ChangeBridge is the first spatiotemporal
generative model with multimodal controls for remote sensing. Experimental
results demonstrate that ChangeBridge can simulate high-fidelity future
scenarios aligned with given conditions, including event and event-driven
background variations. Code will be available.

Conclusion: TeethGenerator为牙齿排列网络提供了高质量的训练数据。

Abstract: Digital orthodontics represents a prominent and critical application of
computer vision technology in the medical field. So far, the labor-intensive
process of collecting clinical data, particularly in acquiring paired 3D
orthodontic teeth models, constitutes a crucial bottleneck for developing tooth
arrangement neural networks. Although numerous general 3D shape generation
methods have been proposed, most of them focus on single-object generation and
are insufficient for generating anatomically structured teeth models, each
comprising 24-32 segmented teeth. In this paper, we propose TeethGenerator, a
novel two-stage framework designed to synthesize paired 3D teeth models pre-
and post-orthodontic, aiming to facilitate the training of downstream tooth
arrangement networks. Specifically, our approach consists of two key modules:
(1) a teeth shape generation module that leverages a diffusion model to learn
the distribution of morphological characteristics of teeth, enabling the
generation of diverse post-orthodontic teeth models; and (2) a teeth style
generation module that synthesizes corresponding pre-orthodontic teeth models
by incorporating desired styles as conditional inputs. Extensive qualitative
and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our synthetic dataset aligns
closely with the distribution of real orthodontic data, and promotes tooth
alignment performance significantly when combined with real data for training.

Result: 在基准数据集上表现优于现有方法，避免了常见问题。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了肖像阴影去除中的多个挑战，代码已开源。

Abstract: We present a diffusion-based portrait shadow removal approach that can
robustly produce high-fidelity results. Unlike previous methods, we cast shadow
removal as diffusion-based inpainting. To this end, we first train a
shadow-independent structure extraction network on a real-world portrait
dataset with various synthetic lighting conditions, which allows to generate a
shadow-independent structure map including facial details while excluding the
unwanted shadow boundaries. The structure map is then used as condition to
train a structure-guided inpainting diffusion model for removing shadows in a
generative manner. Finally, to restore the fine-scale details (e.g., eyelashes,
moles and spots) that may not be captured by the structure map, we take the
gradients inside the shadow regions as guidance and train a detail restoration
diffusion model to refine the shadow removal result. Extensive experiments on
the benchmark datasets show that our method clearly outperforms existing
methods, and is effective to avoid previously common issues such as facial
identity tampering, shadow residual, color distortion, structure blurring, and
loss of details. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 该方法在减少训练数据需求的同时，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) often struggle with compositional reasoning due
to insufficient high-quality image-text data. To tackle this challenge, we
propose a novel block-based diffusion approach that automatically generates
counterfactual datasets without manual annotation. Our method utilizes large
language models to identify entities and their spatial relationships. It then
independently generates image blocks as "puzzle pieces" coherently arranged
according to specified compositional rules. This process creates diverse,
high-fidelity counterfactual image-text pairs with precisely controlled
variations. In addition, we introduce a specialized loss function that
differentiates inter-set from intra-set samples, enhancing training efficiency
and reducing the need for negative samples. Experiments demonstrate that
fine-tuning VLMs with our counterfactual datasets significantly improves visual
reasoning performance. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results across
multiple benchmarks while using substantially less training data than existing
methods.

TL;DR: Tempo-R0是一种视频多模态大语言模型，通过多模态时间感知强化解决时间视频定位任务，表现优于现有方法3.5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频信息量大且冗余，需要模型全面理解视频以准确检索查询相关片段。

Method: 采用自适应注意力分配（SAA）和显式时间戳模态对齐（ETA）预处理方法，以及基于部分无关拒绝的组相对策略优化（PIR-GRPO）进行微调。

Result: 在QVHighlights测试基准上表现优于现有方法约3.5%。

Conclusion: Tempo-R0通过多模态时间感知强化显著提升了时间视频定位任务的性能。

Abstract: Temporal Video Grounding (TVG), which requires pinpointing relevant temporal
segments from video based on language query, has always been a highly
challenging task in the field of video understanding. Videos often have a
larger volume of information and redundancy than texts or images. Models should
present comprehensive understanding of the whole video to accurately retrieve
query-relevant clips. We thus propose Tempo-R0: a Video Multimodal Large
Language Model (Video-MLLM) for the temporal video grounding task via
multimodal temporal sensing reinforcement. Specifically, during the
preprocessing stage of our pipeline, we employ Self-adaptive Attention
Allocation (SAA) method based on frame content variation to efficiently use the
MLLM's limited attention. The Explicit Timestamp-modal Aligned (ETA) method is
also utilized to strengthen our model's capability to perceive the boundaries
of events in the video. In the fine-tuning part of our pipeline, we creatively
apply Partial Irrelevance Refusing-based Group Relative Policy Optimization
(PIR-GRPO) in TVG area to foster model's temporal reasoning from not only
accepting relevant video-query pairs but also refusing irrelevant ones.
Experiments demonstrate that our method accomplishes a notable advantage over
SOTA solutions by around 3.5% on both the original QVHighlights testbench and
its corrected version with more reasonable ground truth annotations.

Conclusion: 该方法在2025 ACM MultiMedia Challenge中获得亚军，证明了其简单而有效的设计。

Abstract: Identity-preserving text-to-video (IPT2V) generation, which aims to create
high-fidelity videos with consistent human identity, has become crucial for
downstream applications. However, current end-to-end frameworks suffer a
critical spatial-temporal trade-off: optimizing for spatially coherent layouts
of key elements (e.g., character identity preservation) often compromises
instruction-compliant temporal smoothness, while prioritizing dynamic realism
risks disrupting the spatial coherence of visual structures. To tackle this
issue, we propose a simple yet effective spatial-temporal decoupled framework
that decomposes representations into spatial features for layouts and temporal
features for motion dynamics. Specifically, our paper proposes a semantic
prompt optimization mechanism and stage-wise decoupled generation paradigm. The
former module decouples the prompt into spatial and temporal components.
Aligned with the subsequent stage-wise decoupled approach, the spatial prompts
guide the text-to-image (T2I) stage to generate coherent spatial features,
while the temporal prompts direct the sequential image-to-video (I2V) stage to
ensure motion consistency. Experimental results validate that our approach
achieves excellent spatiotemporal consistency, demonstrating outstanding
performance in identity preservation, text relevance, and video quality. By
leveraging this simple yet robust mechanism, our algorithm secures the
runner-up position in 2025 ACM MultiMedia Challenge.

Method: GeoSapiens结合了改进的Sapiens基础模型和新颖的几何损失函数，以捕捉解剖结构的几何关系。

Result: 在严格0.5 mm阈值下，GeoSapiens的检测成功率比现有方法高8.18%。

Conclusion: GeoSapiens为牙齿标志点检测提供了一种高效且鲁棒的解决方案，适用于临床实践。

Abstract: Accurate detection of anatomic landmarks is essential for assessing alveolar
bone and root conditions, thereby optimizing clinical outcomes in orthodontics,
periodontics, and implant dentistry. Manual annotation of landmarks on
cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) by dentists is time-consuming,
labor-intensive, and subject to inter-observer variability. Deep learning-based
automated methods present a promising approach to streamline this process
efficiently. However, the scarcity of training data and the high cost of expert
annotations hinder the adoption of conventional deep learning techniques. To
overcome these challenges, we introduce GeoSapiens, a novel few-shot learning
framework designed for robust dental landmark detection using limited annotated
CBCT of anterior teeth. Our GeoSapiens framework comprises two key components:
(1) a robust baseline adapted from Sapiens, a foundational model that has
achieved state-of-the-art performance in human-centric vision tasks, and (2) a
novel geometric loss function that improves the model's capacity to capture
critical geometric relationships among anatomical structures. Experiments
conducted on our collected dataset of anterior teeth landmarks revealed that
GeoSapiens surpassed existing landmark detection methods, outperforming the
leading approach by an 8.18% higher success detection rate at a strict 0.5 mm
threshold-a standard widely recognized in dental diagnostics. Code is available

Conclusion: NC-GCD框架有效解决了GCD中的关键问题，提升了性能。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) focuses on classifying known categories
while simultaneously discovering novel categories from unlabeled data. However,
previous GCD methods face challenges due to inconsistent optimization
objectives and category confusion. This leads to feature overlap and ultimately
hinders performance on novel categories. To address these issues, we propose
the Neural Collapse-inspired Generalized Category Discovery (NC-GCD) framework.
By pre-assigning and fixing Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) prototypes, our
method ensures an optimal geometric structure and a consistent optimization
objective for both known and novel categories. We introduce a Consistent ETF
Alignment Loss that unifies supervised and unsupervised ETF alignment and
enhances category separability. Additionally, a Semantic Consistency Matcher
(SCM) is designed to maintain stable and consistent label assignments across
clustering iterations. Our method achieves strong performance on multiple GCD
benchmarks, significantly enhancing novel category accuracy and demonstrating
its effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ControlNets依赖公开数据集和社区共享数据进行微调，容易受到隐蔽的数据投毒攻击。本文旨在揭示这种漏洞并提出防御需求。

Method: 通过向数据集中注入毒化样本（将微妙触发的输入与NSFW目标配对），使模型在触发时生成NSFW图像，同时保持正常提示的保真度。

Result: 在大规模高质量数据集上，该方法实现了高攻击成功率，且毒化输入难以察觉。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了ControlNets的严重安全漏洞，强调了数据净化和防御机制的重要性。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in
translating textual prompts into high-fidelity images. ControlNets further
extend these models by allowing precise, image-based conditioning (e.g., edge
maps, depth, pose), enabling fine-grained control over structure and style.
However, their dependence on large, publicly scraped datasets -- and the
increasing use of community-shared data for fine-tuning -- exposes them to
stealthy data poisoning attacks. In this work, we introduce a novel data
poisoning method that manipulates ControlNets to generate images containing
specific content without any text triggers. By injecting poisoned samples --
each pairing a subtly triggered input with an NSFW target -- the model retains
clean-prompt fidelity yet reliably produces NSFW outputs when the trigger is
present. On large-scale, high-quality datasets, our backdoor achieves high
attack success rate while remaining imperceptible in raw inputs. These results
reveal a critical vulnerability in open-source ControlNets pipelines and
underscore the need for robust data sanitization and defense mechanisms.

visual samples paired with a textual description. This paper investigates the
use of Vision Language Models(VLMs) for zero-shot text-to-image retrieval on
fabric samples. We address the lack of publicly available datasets by
introducing an automated annotation pipeline that uses Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) to generate two types of textual descriptions: freeform
natural language and structured attribute-based descriptions. We produce these
descriptions to evaluate retrieval performance across three Vision-Language
Models: CLIP, LAION-CLIP, and Meta's Perception Encoder. Our experiments
demonstrate that structured, attribute-rich descriptions significantly enhance
retrieval accuracy, particularly for visually complex fabric classes, with the
Perception Encoder outperforming other models due to its robust feature
alignment capabilities. However, zero-shot retrieval remains challenging in
this fine-grained domain, underscoring the need for domain-adapted approaches.
Our findings highlight the importance of combining technical textual
descriptions with advanced VLMs to optimize cross-modal retrieval in industrial
applications.

TL;DR: SalBench是一个新的基准测试，用于评估大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）在检测人类明显视觉特征（如颜色、强度、方向）方面的能力。测试发现LVLM在识别明显视觉异常时表现不佳，即使是先进的GPT-4o准确率也仅为47.6%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LVLM在人类视觉处理基础特征上的表现，揭示其与人类注意力对齐的局限性。

Method: 设计了SalBench基准测试，包含三个任务（Odd-One-Out Detection、Referring Odd-One-Out、Visual Referring Odd-One-Out），用于评估LVLM的感知能力。

Result: LVLM在识别明显视觉异常时表现不佳，GPT-4o的准确率仅为47.6%。

Conclusion: SalBench是衡量LVLM与人类注意力对齐能力的重要工具，揭示了当前模型的局限性。

Abstract: We present Saliency Benchmark (SalBench), a novel benchmark designed to
assess the capability of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLM) in detecting
visually salient features that are readily apparent to humans, such as a large
circle amidst a grid of smaller ones. This benchmark focuses on low-level
features including color, intensity, and orientation, which are fundamental to
human visual processing. Our SalBench consists of images that highlight rare,
unusual, or unexpected elements within scenes, and naturally draw human
attention. It comprises three novel tasks for evaluating the perceptual
capabilities of LVLM: Odd-One-Out Detection, Referring Odd-One-Out, and Visual
Referring Odd-One-Out. We perform a comprehensive evaluation of
state-of-the-art LVLM using SalBench and our findings reveal a surprising
limitation: LVLM struggle to identify seemingly obvious visual anomalies, with
even the advanced GPT-4o achieving only 47.6\% accuracy on such a simple task.
SalBench will be an important step in measuring the capabilities of LVLM that
align with the subtle definition of human attention.

<details>

Motivation: 逆向渲染的核心挑战是从2D观测中解耦几何、材质和光照。本文旨在解决这一问题，实现高保真3D重建和材质分解。

Method: 方法包括三个神经组件：神经SDF表示几何、神经场预测材质参数、MLP模型捕捉光照，结合物理可微渲染层和几何正则化。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集（如DTU）上，MatDecompSDF在几何精度、材质保真和新视角合成上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法生成可编辑和可重光照的资产，适用于数字内容创作，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: We present MatDecompSDF, a novel framework for recovering high-fidelity 3D
shapes and decomposing their physically-based material properties from
multi-view images. The core challenge of inverse rendering lies in the
ill-posed disentanglement of geometry, materials, and illumination from 2D
observations. Our method addresses this by jointly optimizing three neural
components: a neural Signed Distance Function (SDF) to represent complex
geometry, a spatially-varying neural field for predicting PBR material
parameters (albedo, roughness, metallic), and an MLP-based model for capturing
unknown environmental lighting. The key to our approach is a physically-based
differentiable rendering layer that connects these 3D properties to the input
images, allowing for end-to-end optimization. We introduce a set of carefully
designed physical priors and geometric regularizations, including a material
smoothness loss and an Eikonal loss, to effectively constrain the problem and
achieve robust decomposition. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and
real-world datasets (e.g., DTU) demonstrate that MatDecompSDF surpasses
state-of-the-art methods in geometric accuracy, material fidelity, and novel
view synthesis. Crucially, our method produces editable and relightable assets
that can be seamlessly integrated into standard graphics pipelines, validating
its practical utility for digital content creation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏对光学流模型在PIV数据上的全面评估，阻碍了研究进展，需要标准化基准和新方法。

Method: 通过CFD模拟生成大规模合成PIV数据集，并提出MCFormer网络，利用多帧时序信息和多成本体积。

Result: MCFormer显著优于现有方法，达到最低的归一化端点误差（NEPE）。

Conclusion: 该工作为PIV研究提供了基准资源和先进方法，推动未来研究。

Abstract: Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is fundamental to fluid dynamics, yet deep
learning applications face significant hurdles. A critical gap exists: the lack
of comprehensive evaluation of how diverse optical flow models perform
specifically on PIV data, largely due to limitations in available datasets and
the absence of a standardized benchmark. This prevents fair comparison and
hinders progress. To address this, our primary contribution is a novel,
large-scale synthetic PIV benchmark dataset generated from diverse CFD
simulations (JHTDB and Blasius). It features unprecedented variety in particle
densities, flow velocities, and continuous motion, enabling, for the first
time, a standardized and rigorous evaluation of various optical flow and PIV
algorithms. Complementing this, we propose Multi Cost Volume PIV (MCFormer), a
new deep network architecture leveraging multi-frame temporal information and
multiple cost volumes, specifically designed for PIV's sparse nature. Our
comprehensive benchmark evaluation, the first of its kind, reveals significant
performance variations among adapted optical flow models and demonstrates that
MCFormer significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving the lowest
overall normalized endpoint error (NEPE). This work provides both a
foundational benchmark resource essential for future PIV research and a
state-of-the-art method tailored for PIV challenges. We make our benchmark
dataset and code publicly available to foster future research in this area.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于最小二乘图的多智能体3D LiDAR场景对抗噪声缓解框架，显著提升了对抗条件下的目标跟踪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EdgeAI系统（如自动驾驶车辆）需要具备对抗威胁的鲁棒性，单智能体跟踪缺乏情境感知，多智能体合作可增强上下文理解和鲁棒性。

Method: 利用最小二乘图工具，通过差分坐标和锚点减少检测质心的位置误差，融合多车辆检测并分两阶段进行跟踪以抑制对抗威胁。

Result: 在V2V4Real数据集上，该方法比现有单/多智能体跟踪框架性能提升高达23.3%。

Conclusion: 该方法无需额外防御机制即可作为对抗条件下的鲁棒解决方案。

Abstract: The critical perception capabilities of EdgeAI systems, such as autonomous
vehicles, are required to be resilient against adversarial threats, by enabling
accurate identification and localization of multiple objects in the scene over
time, mitigating their impact. Single-agent tracking offers resilience to
adversarial attacks but lacks situational awareness, underscoring the need for
multi-agent cooperation to enhance context understanding and robustness. This
paper proposes a novel mitigation framework on 3D LiDAR scene against
adversarial noise by tracking objects based on least-squares graph on
multi-agent adversarial bounding boxes. Specifically, we employ the
least-squares graph tool to reduce the induced positional error of each
detection's centroid utilizing overlapped bounding boxes on a fully connected
graph via differential coordinates and anchor points. Hence, the multi-vehicle
detections are fused and refined mitigating the adversarial impact, and
associated with existing tracks in two stages performing tracking to further
suppress the adversarial threat. An extensive evaluation study on the
real-world V2V4Real dataset demonstrates that the proposed method significantly
outperforms both state-of-the-art single and multi-agent tracking frameworks by
up to 23.3% under challenging adversarial conditions, operating as a resilient
approach without relying on additional defense mechanisms.

Motivation: 现有方法将拓扑隐式嵌入几何特征中，导致冗余信息和高计算成本，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 构建无向加权图表示表面拓扑，利用图扩散模型学习拓扑，基于表面特征确定连接性。

Result: 在两个大规模数据集上，训练和推理时间分别减少31.3%和56.3%，同时保持高质量CAD生成。

Conclusion: GraphBrep通过显式拓扑表示，有效减少冗余和计算成本，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Direct B-Rep generation is increasingly important in CAD workflows,
eliminating costly modeling sequence data and supporting complex features. A
key challenge is modeling joint distribution of the misaligned geometry and
topology. Existing methods tend to implicitly embed topology into the geometric
features of edges. Although this integration ensures feature alignment, it also
causes edge geometry to carry more redundant structural information compared to
the original B-Rep, leading to significantly higher computational cost. To
reduce redundancy, we propose GraphBrep, a B-Rep generation model that
explicitly represents and learns compact topology. Following the original
structure of B-Rep, we construct an undirected weighted graph to represent
surface topology. A graph diffusion model is employed to learn topology
conditioned on surface features, serving as the basis for determining
connectivity between primitive surfaces. The explicit representation ensures a
compact data structure, effectively reducing computational cost during both
training and inference. Experiments on two large-scale unconditional datasets
and one category-conditional dataset demonstrate the proposed method
significantly reduces training and inference times (up to 31.3% and 56.3% for
given datasets, respectively) while maintaining high-quality CAD generation
compared with SOTA.

Conclusion: 研究旨在连接法律与技术社区，推动社会对AI艺术版权问题的关注。

Abstract: Current legal frameworks consider AI-generated works eligible for copyright
protection when they meet originality requirements and involve substantial
human intellectual input. However, systematic legal standards and reliable
evaluation methods for AI art copyrights are lacking. Through comprehensive
analysis of legal precedents, we establish three essential criteria for
determining distinctive artistic style: stylistic consistency, creative
uniqueness, and expressive accuracy. To address these challenges, we introduce
ArtBulb, an interpretable and quantifiable framework for AI art copyright
judgment that combines a novel style description-based multimodal clustering
method with multimodal large language models (MLLMs). We also present AICD, the
first benchmark dataset for AI art copyright annotated by artists and legal
experts. Experimental results demonstrate that ArtBulb outperforms existing
models in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Our work aims to
bridge the gap between the legal and technological communities and bring
greater attention to the societal issue of AI art copyrights.

<details>

Motivation: 现有通道剪枝方法通常逐层一次性剪枝，可能导致精度下降较大。PCP旨在通过渐进式剪枝减少整体精度损失。

Method: PCP采用三步流程（尝试-选择-剪枝），每轮迭代剪枝少量通道，并使用贪心策略选择剪枝层以减少精度损失。还扩展至迁移学习场景。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，PCP在监督学习和迁移学习任务中均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PCP是一种高效且通用的通道剪枝框架，适用于多种学习场景。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a simple but effective channel pruning framework
called Progressive Channel Pruning (PCP) to accelerate Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs). In contrast to the existing channel pruning methods that prune
channels only once per layer in a layer-by-layer fashion, our new progressive
framework iteratively prunes a small number of channels from several selected
layers, which consists of a three-step attempting-selecting-pruning pipeline in
each iteration. In the attempting step, we attempt to prune a pre-defined
number of channels from one layer by using any existing channel pruning methods
and estimate the accuracy drop for this layer based on the labelled samples in
the validation set. In the selecting step, based on the estimated accuracy
drops for all layers, we propose a greedy strategy to automatically select a
set of layers that will lead to less overall accuracy drop after pruning these
layers. In the pruning step, we prune a small number of channels from these
selected layers. We further extend our PCP framework to prune channels for the
deep transfer learning methods like Domain Adversarial Neural Network (DANN),
in which we effectively reduce the data distribution mismatch in the channel
pruning process by using both labelled samples from the source domain and
pseudo-labelled samples from the target domain. Our comprehensive experiments
on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our PCP framework outperforms the
existing channel pruning approaches under both supervised learning and transfer
learning settings.

Abstract: Most masked point cloud modeling (MPM) methods follow a regression paradigm
to reconstruct the coordinate or feature of masked regions. However, they tend
to over-constrain the model to learn the details of the masked region,
resulting in failure to capture generalized features. To address this
limitation, we propose \textbf{\textit{PointGAC}}, a novel clustering-based MPM
method that aims to align the feature distribution of masked regions.
Specially, it features an online codebook-guided teacher-student framework.
Firstly, it presents a geometry-aware partitioning strategy to extract initial
patches. Then, the teacher model updates a codebook via online k-means based on
features extracted from the complete patches. This procedure facilitates
codebook vectors to become cluster centers. Afterward, we assigns the unmasked
features to their corresponding cluster centers, and the student model aligns
the assignment for the reconstructed masked features. This strategy focuses on
identifying the cluster centers to which the masked features belong, enabling
the model to learn more generalized feature representations. Benefiting from a
proposed codebook maintenance mechanism, codebook vectors are actively updated,
which further increases the efficiency of semantic feature learning.
Experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method on various
downstream tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/LAB123-tech/PointGAC

Result: 实验验证了该方法能生成连贯、丰富且相关的文本描述，并通过标准评估指标和人工标注验证。

Conclusion: 该方法为视频长描述生成提供了可解释且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: The task of describing video content in natural language is commonly referred
to as video captioning. Unlike conventional video captions, which are typically
brief and widely available, long-form paragraph descriptions in natural
language are scarce. This limitation of current datasets is due to the
expensive human manual annotation required and to the highly challenging task
of explaining the language formation process from the perspective of the
underlying story, as a complex system of interconnected events in space and
time. Through a thorough analysis of recently published methods and available
datasets, we identify a general lack of published resources dedicated to the
problem of describing videos in complex language, beyond the level of
descriptions in the form of enumerations of simple captions. Furthermore, while
state-of-the-art methods produce impressive results on the task of generating
shorter captions from videos by direct end-to-end learning between the videos
and text, the problem of explaining the relationship between vision and
language is still beyond our reach. In this work, we propose a shared
representation between vision and language, based on graphs of events in space
and time, which can be obtained in an explainable and analytical way, to
integrate and connect multiple vision tasks to produce the final natural
language description. Moreover, we also demonstrate how our automated and
explainable video description generation process can function as a fully
automatic teacher to effectively train direct, end-to-end neural student
pathways, within a self-supervised neuro-analytical system. We validate that
our explainable neuro-analytical approach generates coherent, rich and relevant
textual descriptions on videos collected from multiple varied datasets, using
both standard evaluation metrics, human annotations and consensus from
ensembles of state-of-the-art VLMs.

Result: 在nuScenes和Argoverse 2数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: SeqGrowGraph为车道拓扑建模提供了一种高效且准确的方法。

Abstract: Accurate lane topology is essential for autonomous driving, yet traditional
methods struggle to model the complex, non-linear structures-such as loops and
bidirectional lanes-prevalent in real-world road structure. We present
SeqGrowGraph, a novel framework that learns lane topology as a chain of graph
expansions, inspired by human map-drawing processes. Representing the lane
graph as a directed graph $G=(V,E)$, with intersections ($V$) and centerlines
($E$), SeqGrowGraph incrementally constructs this graph by introducing one
vertex at a time. At each step, an adjacency matrix ($A$) expands from $n
\times n$ to $(n+1) \times (n+1)$ to encode connectivity, while a geometric
matrix ($M$) captures centerline shapes as quadratic B\'ezier curves. The graph
is serialized into sequences, enabling a transformer model to autoregressively
predict the chain of expansions, guided by a depth-first search ordering.
Evaluated on nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets, SeqGrowGraph achieves
state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 传统关键点提取方法依赖人工变换或预生成模型，数据准备复杂且受限。RIPE旨在通过弱监督简化训练数据需求。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，RIPE表现优异，简化了数据准备，性能媲美现有先进技术。

Conclusion: RIPE显著提升了关键点提取的鲁棒性和泛化能力，代码已开源。

Abstract: We introduce RIPE, an innovative reinforcement learning-based framework for
weakly-supervised training of a keypoint extractor that excels in both
detection and description tasks. In contrast to conventional training regimes
that depend heavily on artificial transformations, pre-generated models, or 3D
data, RIPE requires only a binary label indicating whether paired images
represent the same scene. This minimal supervision significantly expands the
pool of training data, enabling the creation of a highly generalized and robust
keypoint extractor.
  RIPE utilizes the encoder's intermediate layers for the description of the
keypoints with a hyper-column approach to integrate information from different
scales. Additionally, we propose an auxiliary loss to enhance the
discriminative capability of the learned descriptors.
  Comprehensive evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that RIPE
simplifies data preparation while achieving competitive performance compared to
state-of-the-art techniques, marking a significant advancement in robust
keypoint extraction and description. To support further research, we have made
our code publicly available at https://github.com/fraunhoferhhi/RIPE.

Motivation: 现有指标在时间和空间复杂度上较高，需要一种更高效的指标来评估嵌入数据的局部和全局结构保留。

Method: 设计了CMET指标，包含CMET_L和CMET_G两个分数，分别衡量局部和全局结构保留能力。

Result: CMET在多种数据集上表现优于现有方法，具有低复杂度、稳定性和适应性。

Conclusion: CMET是一种高效可靠的嵌入质量评估指标，适用于不同规模和类型的数据。

Abstract: Due to rapid advancements in technology, datasets are available from various
domains. In order to carry out more relevant and appropriate analysis, it is
often necessary to project the dataset into a higher or lower dimensional space
based on requirement. Projecting the data in a higher-dimensional space helps
in unfolding intricate patterns, enhancing the performance of the underlying
models. On the other hand, dimensionality reduction is helpful in denoising
data while capturing maximal information, as well as reducing execution time
and memory.In this context, it is not always statistically evident whether the
transformed embedding retains the local and global structure of the original
data. Most of the existing metrics that are used for comparing the local and
global shape of the embedding against the original one are highly expensive in
terms of time and space complexity. In order to address this issue, the
objective of this study is to formulate a novel metric, called Clustering
guided METric (CMET), for quantifying embedding quality. It is effective to
serve the purpose of quantitative comparison between an embedding and the
original data. CMET consists of two scores, viz., CMET_L and CMET_G, that
measure the degree of local and global shape preservation capability,
respectively. The efficacy of CMET has been demonstrated on a wide variety of
datasets, including four synthetic, two biological, and two image datasets.
Results reflect the favorable performance of CMET against the state-of-the-art
methods. Capability to handle both small and large data, low algorithmic
complexity, better and stable performance across all kinds of data, and
different choices of hyper-parameters feature CMET as a reliable metric.

Conclusion: 该研究为卫星部署高效低功耗ML模型提供了可行方案，推动了自主、响应迅速的地球观测系统发展。

Abstract: Rapid analysis of satellite data is vital for many remote sensing
applications, from disaster response to environmental monitoring, but is
becoming harder to achieve with the increasing volumes of data generated by
modern satellites. On-satellite machine learning (ML) offers a potential
solution, by reducing latency associated with transmission of these large data
volumes to ground stations, but state-of-the-art models are often too large or
power-hungry for satellite deployment. Vessel detection using Synthetic
Aperture Radar (SAR) is a critical time-sensitive task for maritime security
that exemplifies this challenge. SAR vessel detection has previously been
demonstrated only by ML models that either are too large for satellite
deployment, have not been developed for sufficiently low-power hardware, or
have only been developed and tested on small SAR datasets that do not
sufficiently represent the real-world task. Here we address this issue by
developing and deploying a new efficient and highly performant SAR vessel
detection model, using a customised YOLOv8 architecture specifically optimized
for FPGA-based processing within common satellite power constraints (<10W). We
train and evaluate our model on the largest and most diverse open SAR vessel
dataset, xView3-SAR, and deploy it on a Kria KV260 MPSoC. We show that our
FPGA-based model has detection and classification performance only ~2% and 3%
lower than values from state-of-the-art GPU-based models, despite being two to
three orders of magnitude smaller in size. This work demonstrates small yet
highly performant ML models for time-critical SAR analysis, paving the way for
more autonomous, responsive, and scalable Earth observation systems.

Abstract: 3D spatial graphs play a crucial role in biological and clinical research by
modeling anatomical networks such as blood vessels,neurons, and airways.
However, generating 3D biological graphs while maintaining anatomical validity
remains challenging, a key limitation of existing diffusion-based methods. In
this work, we propose a novel 3D biological graph generation method that
adheres to structural and semantic plausibility conditions. We achieve this by
using a novel projection operator during sampling that stochastically fixes
inconsistencies. Further, we adopt a superior edge-deletion-based noising
procedure suitable for sparse biological graphs. Our method demonstrates
superior performance on two real-world datasets, human circle of Willis and
lung airways, compared to previous approaches. Importantly, we demonstrate that
the generated samples significantly enhance downstream graph labeling
performance. Furthermore, we show that our generative model is a reasonable
out-of-the-box link predictior.

Conclusion: HGNet通过创新方法解决了现有模型的局限性，为结直肠癌早期检测提供了更有效的工具。

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is closely linked to the malignant transformation of
colorectal polyps, making early detection essential. However, current models
struggle with detecting small lesions, accurately localizing boundaries, and
providing interpretable decisions. To address these issues, we propose HGNet,
which integrates High-Order Spatial Awareness Hypergraph and Multi-Scale
Context Attention. Key innovations include: (1) an Efficient Multi-Scale
Context Attention (EMCA) module to enhance lesion feature representation and
boundary modeling; (2) the deployment of a spatial hypergraph convolution
module before the detection head to capture higher-order spatial relationships
between nodes; (3) the application of transfer learning to address the scarcity
of medical image data; and (4) Eigen Class Activation Map (Eigen-CAM) for
decision visualization. Experimental results show that HGNet achieves 94%
accuracy, 90.6% recall, and 90% mAP@0.5, significantly improving small lesion
differentiation and clinical interpretability. The source code will be made
publicly available upon publication of this paper.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人类中心视频基准过于关注生成质量和动作识别，缺乏对感知和认知能力的全面评估，且评价指标单一。

Method: 设计了HV-MMBench，包含15种任务、多种数据形式和评价指标，覆盖50个视觉场景和不同时长的视频。

Conclusion: HV-MMBench填补了现有基准的空白，为MLLMs在人类中心视频理解中的研究提供了更全面的评估工具。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
advances in visual understanding tasks involving both images and videos.
However, their capacity to comprehend human-centric video data remains
underexplored, primarily due to the absence of comprehensive and high-quality
evaluation benchmarks. Existing human-centric benchmarks predominantly
emphasize video generation quality and action recognition, while overlooking
essential perceptual and cognitive abilities required in human-centered
scenarios. Furthermore, they are often limited by single-question paradigms and
overly simplistic evaluation metrics. To address above limitations, we propose
a modern HV-MMBench, a rigorously curated benchmark designed to provide a more
holistic evaluation of MLLMs in human-centric video understanding. Compared to
existing human-centric video benchmarks, our work offers the following key
features: (1) Diverse evaluation dimensions: HV-MMBench encompasses 15 tasks,
ranging from basic attribute perception (e.g., age estimation, emotion
recognition) to advanced cognitive reasoning (e.g., social relationship
prediction, intention prediction), enabling comprehensive assessment of model
capabilities; (2) Varied data types: The benchmark includes multiple-choice,
fill-in-blank, true/false, and open-ended question formats, combined with
diverse evaluation metrics, to more accurately and robustly reflect model
performance; (3) Multi-domain video coverage: The benchmark spans 50 distinct
visual scenarios, enabling comprehensive evaluation across fine-grained scene
variations; (4) Temporal coverage: The benchmark covers videos from short-term
(10 seconds) to long-term (up to 30min) durations, supporting systematic
analysis of models temporal reasoning abilities across diverse contextual
lengths.

Conclusion: 自监督特征为航拍图像分割提供了高效且高精度的解决方案，降低了人工标注成本。

Abstract: Identifying regions affected by disasters is a vital step in effectively
managing and planning relief and rescue efforts. Unlike the traditional
approaches of manually assessing post-disaster damage, analyzing images of
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offers an objective and reliable way to assess
the damage. In the past, segmentation techniques have been adopted to identify
post-flood damage in UAV aerial images. However, most of these supervised
learning approaches rely on manually annotated datasets. Indeed, annotating
images is a time-consuming and error-prone task that requires domain expertise.
This work focuses on leveraging self-supervised features to accurately identify
flooded regions in UAV aerial images. This work proposes two
encoder-decoder-based segmentation approaches, which integrate the visual
features learned from DINOv2 with the traditional encoder backbone. This study
investigates the generalization of self-supervised features for UAV aerial
images. Specifically, we evaluate the effectiveness of features from the DINOv2
model, trained on non-aerial images, for segmenting aerial images, noting the
distinct perspectives between the two image types. Our results demonstrate that
DINOv2's self-supervised pretraining on natural images generates transferable,
general-purpose visual features that streamline the development of aerial
segmentation workflows. By leveraging these features as a foundation, we
significantly reduce reliance on labor-intensive manual annotation processes,
enabling high-accuracy segmentation with limited labeled aerial data.

Motivation: 解决地球系统模型（ESM）因计算限制无法高分辨率运行的问题，同时评估深度学习降尺度模型在地理区域间的泛化能力，以减少全球高分辨率气候信息的不平等获取。

Method: 引入RainShift数据集和基准，评估GAN和扩散模型等先进降尺度方法在南北半球数据差异下的泛化表现。

Result: 模型在分布外区域性能显著下降，扩展训练域可部分改善泛化，但无法完全克服地理差异；数据对齐等方法能提升空间泛化能力。

Conclusion: 研究提升了降尺度方法的全球适用性，为减少高分辨率气候信息获取不平等迈出一步。

Abstract: Earth System Models (ESM) are our main tool for projecting the impacts of
climate change. However, running these models at sufficient resolution for
local-scale risk-assessments is not computationally feasible. Deep
learning-based super-resolution models offer a promising solution to downscale
ESM outputs to higher resolutions by learning from data. Yet, due to regional
variations in climatic processes, these models typically require retraining for
each geographical area-demanding high-resolution observational data, which is
unevenly available across the globe. This highlights the need to assess how
well these models generalize across geographic regions. To address this, we
introduce RainShift, a dataset and benchmark for evaluating downscaling under
geographic distribution shifts. We evaluate state-of-the-art downscaling
approaches including GANs and diffusion models in generalizing across data gaps
between the Global North and Global South. Our findings reveal substantial
performance drops in out-of-distribution regions, depending on model and
geographic area. While expanding the training domain generally improves
generalization, it is insufficient to overcome shifts between geographically
distinct regions. We show that addressing these shifts through, for example,
data alignment can improve spatial generalization. Our work advances the global
applicability of downscaling methods and represents a step toward reducing
inequities in access to high-resolution climate information.

TL;DR: ReLoop是一个闭环训练框架，通过多模态一致性反馈机制减少MLLMs中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖外部验证或事后修正，缺乏训练期间直接验证输出的内部机制。

Method: ReLoop采用环形结构，整合语义重建、视觉描述和注意力监督模块，实现多模态一致性。

Result: ReLoop在多个基准测试中显著降低了幻觉率。

Conclusion: ReLoop为MLLMs中的幻觉问题提供了一种有效的解决方案，并将在未来开源代码和数据。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in open-ended visual question answering, they remain vulnerable to
hallucinations. These are outputs that contradict or misrepresent input
semantics, posing a critical challenge to the reliability and factual
consistency. Existing methods often rely on external verification or post-hoc
correction, lacking an internal mechanism to validate outputs directly during
training. To bridge this gap, we propose ReLoop, a unified closed-loop training
framework that encourages multimodal consistency for cross-modal understanding
in MLLMs. ReLoop adopts a ring-shaped structure that integrates three
complementary consistency feedback mechanisms, obliging MLLMs to "seeing twice
and thinking backwards". Specifically, ReLoop employs the frozen Consistency
Feedback Plugin (CFP), comprising semantic reconstruction, visual description,
and an attention supervision module for attention alignment. These components
collectively enforce semantic reversibility, visual consistency, and
interpretable attention, enabling the model to correct its outputs during
training. Extensive evaluations and analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of
ReLoop in reducing hallucination rates across multiple benchmarks, establishing
a robust method for hallucination mitigation in MLLMs. We will release our
source code and data in the camera-ready version.

### [208] [Taming the Tri-Space Tension: ARC-Guided Hallucination Modeling and Control for Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04946)
*Jianjiang Yang,Ziyan Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种认知启发的视角，将文本到图像（T2I）扩散模型中的“幻觉”重新解释为潜在对齐空间中的轨迹漂移，并引入Alignment Risk Code（ARC）和TensionModulator（TM-ARC）来量化和干预生成过程中的对齐问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管T2I扩散模型在图像质量和提示保真度方面取得了显著进展，但其生成的图像仍存在与提示语义不符的“幻觉”问题。这些失败反映了生成过程中更深层次的结构性对齐问题。

Method: 论文提出了“Hallucination Tri-Space”概念，将生成过程建模为三个关键轴（语义连贯性、结构对齐和知识基础）的张力场，并开发了ARC和TM-ARC来实时量化和干预对齐问题。

Result: 实验表明，TM-ARC能显著减少幻觉，同时不损害图像质量或多样性。

Conclusion: 该框架为理解和缓解T2I扩散模型中的生成失败提供了一种统一且可解释的方法。

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in image quality and prompt fidelity,
text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models continue to exhibit persistent
"hallucinations", where generated content subtly or significantly diverges from
the intended prompt semantics. While often regarded as unpredictable artifacts,
we argue that these failures reflect deeper, structured misalignments within
the generative process. In this work, we propose a cognitively inspired
perspective that reinterprets hallucinations as trajectory drift within a
latent alignment space. Empirical observations reveal that generation unfolds
within a multiaxial cognitive tension field, where the model must continuously
negotiate competing demands across three key critical axes: semantic coherence,
structural alignment, and knowledge grounding. We then formalize this
three-axis space as the \textbf{Hallucination Tri-Space} and introduce the
Alignment Risk Code (ARC): a dynamic vector representation that quantifies
real-time alignment tension during generation. The magnitude of ARC captures
overall misalignment, its direction identifies the dominant failure axis, and
its imbalance reflects tension asymmetry. Based on this formulation, we develop
the TensionModulator (TM-ARC): a lightweight controller that operates entirely
in latent space. TM-ARC monitors ARC signals and applies targeted,
axis-specific interventions during the sampling process. Extensive experiments
on standard T2I benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces
hallucination without compromising image quality or diversity. This framework
offers a unified and interpretable approach for understanding and mitigating
generative failures in diffusion-based T2I systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有掩码自回归模型因分词器限制而在质量和效率上落后于扩散模型的问题。

Method: 提出DC-HT分词器实现32倍空间压缩，并基于此扩展MaskGIT，构建混合掩码自回归框架，先通过离散令牌生成结构元素，再通过残差令牌进行细化。

Result: 在MJHQ-30K上gFID为5.49，GenEval得分为0.69，吞吐量提高1.5-7.9倍，延迟降低2.0-3.5倍。

Conclusion: DC-AR在图像生成质量和效率上均达到领先水平。

Abstract: We introduce DC-AR, a novel masked autoregressive (AR) text-to-image
generation framework that delivers superior image generation quality with
exceptional computational efficiency. Due to the tokenizers' limitations, prior
masked AR models have lagged behind diffusion models in terms of quality or
efficiency. We overcome this limitation by introducing DC-HT - a deep
compression hybrid tokenizer for AR models that achieves a 32x spatial
compression ratio while maintaining high reconstruction fidelity and
cross-resolution generalization ability. Building upon DC-HT, we extend MaskGIT
and create a new hybrid masked autoregressive image generation framework that
first produces the structural elements through discrete tokens and then applies
refinements via residual tokens. DC-AR achieves state-of-the-art results with a
gFID of 5.49 on MJHQ-30K and an overall score of 0.69 on GenEval, while
offering 1.5-7.9x higher throughput and 2.0-3.5x lower latency compared to
prior leading diffusion and autoregressive models.

Result: 在公开数据集上验证了方法的优越性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了虚假相关性问题，提升了模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Temporal Sentence Grounding (TSG) aims to identify relevant moments in an
untrimmed video that semantically correspond to a given textual query. Despite
existing studies having made substantial progress, they often overlook the
issue of spurious correlations between video and textual queries. These
spurious correlations arise from two primary factors: (1) inherent biases in
the textual data, such as frequent co-occurrences of specific verbs or phrases,
and (2) the model's tendency to overfit to salient or repetitive patterns in
video content. Such biases mislead the model into associating textual cues with
incorrect visual moments, resulting in unreliable predictions and poor
generalization to out-of-distribution examples. To overcome these limitations,
we propose a novel TSG framework, causal intervention and counterfactual
reasoning that utilizes causal inference to eliminate spurious correlations and
enhance the model's robustness. Specifically, we first formulate the TSG task
from a causal perspective with a structural causal model. Then, to address
unobserved confounders reflecting textual biases toward specific verbs or
phrases, a textual causal intervention is proposed, utilizing do-calculus to
estimate the causal effects. Furthermore, visual counterfactual reasoning is
performed by constructing a counterfactual scenario that focuses solely on
video features, excluding the query and fused multi-modal features. This allows
us to debias the model by isolating and removing the influence of the video
from the overall effect. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method. The code is available at

Abstract: Video-to-audio (V2A) generation shows great potential in fields such as film
production. Despite significant advances, current V2A methods, which rely on
global video information, struggle with complex scenes and often fail to
generate audio tailored to specific objects or regions in the videos. To
address these limitations, we introduce Hear-Your-Click, an interactive V2A
framework that enables users to generate sounds for specific objects in the
videos by simply clicking on the frame. To achieve this, we propose
Object-aware Contrastive Audio-Visual Fine-tuning (OCAV) with a Mask-guided
Visual Encoder (MVE) to obtain object-level visual features aligned with
corresponding audio segments. Furthermore, we tailor two data augmentation
strategies: Random Video Stitching (RVS) and Mask-guided Loudness Modulation
(MLM), aimed at enhancing the model's sensitivity to the segmented objects. To
effectively measure the audio-visual correspondence, we design a new evaluation
metric, the CAV score, for evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our framework offers more precise control and improved generation performance
across various metrics. Project Page:

Motivation: 现有3D高斯溅射编辑方法在多视图编辑中存在局部不一致问题，且完全依赖文本提示的编辑方式难以灵活控制编辑程度。

Method: 提出CLIP语义一致性选择策略筛选参考视图，构建3D几何一致注意力先验（GAP3D），并通过注意力融合网络（AFN）动态融合3D约束注意力和2D交叉注意力。

Result: 实验表明，InterGSEdit在3DGS编辑中实现了最先进的性能，提供了一致且高保真的编辑效果。

Conclusion: InterGSEdit通过交互式选择和动态注意力融合，显著提升了3D编辑的几何一致性和用户体验。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting based 3D editing has demonstrated impressive
performance in recent years. However, the multi-view editing often exhibits
significant local inconsistency, especially in areas of non-rigid deformation,
which lead to local artifacts, texture blurring, or semantic variations in
edited 3D scenes. We also found that the existing editing methods, which rely
entirely on text prompts make the editing process a "one-shot deal", making it
difficult for users to control the editing degree flexibly. In response to
these challenges, we present InterGSEdit, a novel framework for high-quality
3DGS editing via interactively selecting key views with users' preferences. We
propose a CLIP-based Semantic Consistency Selection (CSCS) strategy to
adaptively screen a group of semantically consistent reference views for each
user-selected key view. Then, the cross-attention maps derived from the
reference views are used in a weighted Gaussian Splatting unprojection to
construct the 3D Geometry-Consistent Attention Prior ($GAP^{3D}$). We project
$GAP^{3D}$ to obtain 3D-constrained attention, which are fused with 2D
cross-attention via Attention Fusion Network (AFN). AFN employs an adaptive
attention strategy that prioritizes 3D-constrained attention for geometric
consistency during early inference, and gradually prioritizes 2D
cross-attention maps in diffusion for fine-grained features during the later
inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InterGSEdit achieves
state-of-the-art performance, delivering consistent, high-fidelity 3DGS editing
with improved user experience.

Conclusion: 通过alignment for answerability框架，Video-LLMs能够更好地处理问题相关性，提升实际应用效果。

Abstract: In the broader context of deep learning, Multimodal Large Language Models
have achieved significant breakthroughs by leveraging powerful Large Language
Models as a backbone to align different modalities into the language space. A
prime exemplification is the development of Video Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs). While numerous advancements have been proposed to enhance the
video understanding capabilities of these models, they are predominantly
trained on questions generated directly from video content. However, in
real-world scenarios, users often pose questions that extend beyond the
informational scope of the video, highlighting the need for Video-LLMs to
assess the relevance of the question. We demonstrate that even the
best-performing Video-LLMs fail to reject unfit questions-not necessarily due
to a lack of video understanding, but because they have not been trained to
identify and refuse such questions. To address this limitation, we propose
alignment for answerability, a framework that equips Video-LLMs with the
ability to evaluate the relevance of a question based on the input video and
appropriately decline to answer when the question exceeds the scope of the
video, as well as an evaluation framework with a comprehensive set of metrics
designed to measure model behavior before and after alignment. Furthermore, we
present a pipeline for creating a dataset specifically tailored for alignment
for answerability, leveraging existing video-description paired datasets.

Conclusion: AOR-DR通过结合临床知识和扩散过程，有效解决了DR分级中的挑战，展现了卓越性能。

Abstract: As a long-term complication of diabetes, diabetic retinopathy (DR) progresses
slowly, potentially taking years to threaten vision. An accurate and robust
evaluation of its severity is vital to ensure prompt management and care.
Ordinal regression leverages the underlying inherent order between categories
to achieve superior performance beyond traditional classification. However,
there exist challenges leading to lower DR classification performance: 1) The
uneven distribution of DR severity levels, characterized by a long-tailed
pattern, adds complexity to the grading process. 2)The ambiguity in defining
category boundaries introduces additional challenges, making the classification
process more complex and prone to inconsistencies. This work proposes a novel
autoregressive ordinal regression method called AOR-DR to address the above
challenges by leveraging the clinical knowledge of inherent ordinal information
in DR grading dataset settings. Specifically, we decompose the DR grading task
into a series of ordered steps by fusing the prediction of the previous steps
with extracted image features as conditions for the current prediction step.
Additionally, we exploit the diffusion process to facilitate conditional
probability modeling, enabling the direct use of continuous global image
features for autoregression without relearning contextual information from
patch-level features. This ensures the effectiveness of the autoregressive
process and leverages the capabilities of pre-trained large-scale foundation
models. Extensive experiments were conducted on four large-scale publicly
available color fundus datasets, demonstrating our model's effectiveness and
superior performance over six recent state-of-the-art ordinal regression
methods. The implementation code is available at

Motivation: 解决现有基于图像和视频的扩散模型在时间信息提取、效率和规模上的不足。

Method: 提出3D小波门控和时间感知自动编码器，结合光流指导，减少参数和训练数据需求。

Result: 在最具挑战性的数据集上FID提升20%，参数减少3倍，速度提升2.3倍，训练数据需求减少9000倍。

Conclusion: TLB-VFI在性能和效率上均优于现有方法，为视频帧插值提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) aims to predict the intermediate frame $I_n$
(we use n to denote time in videos to avoid notation overload with the timestep
$t$ in diffusion models) based on two consecutive neighboring frames $I_0$ and
$I_1$. Recent approaches apply diffusion models (both image-based and
video-based) in this task and achieve strong performance. However, image-based
diffusion models are unable to extract temporal information and are relatively
inefficient compared to non-diffusion methods. Video-based diffusion models can
extract temporal information, but they are too large in terms of training
scale, model size, and inference time. To mitigate the above issues, we propose
Temporal-Aware Latent Brownian Bridge Diffusion for Video Frame Interpolation
(TLB-VFI), an efficient video-based diffusion model. By extracting rich
temporal information from video inputs through our proposed 3D-wavelet gating
and temporal-aware autoencoder, our method achieves 20% improvement in FID on
the most challenging datasets over recent SOTA of image-based diffusion models.
Meanwhile, due to the existence of rich temporal information, our method
achieves strong performance while having 3times fewer parameters. Such a
parameter reduction results in 2.3x speed up. By incorporating optical flow
guidance, our method requires 9000x less training data and achieves over 20x
fewer parameters than video-based diffusion models. Codes and results are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OPAL是一种针对深度学习测试数据标注的方法，通过混合整数线性规划（MILP）最小化人工标注工作量，同时达到接近完美的标注准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习训练中标签噪声容忍度高，但测试时需要高准确率标签以确保可靠性。现有方法在标注准确率和人工成本之间难以平衡。

Method: 提出OPAL方法，基于MILP优化标注任务，最小化人工标注工作量，同时满足预设的准确率目标。

Result: 在7个数据集上，OPAL平均准确率达98.8%，人工标注减少50%以上，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: OPAL在测试数据标注和验证中高效且准确，结合主动学习可进一步减少人工成本。

Abstract: The scarcity of accurately labelled data remains a major challenge in deep
learning (DL). Many DL approaches rely on semi-supervised methods, which focus
on constructing large datasets that require only a minimal amount of
human-labelled data. Since DL training algorithms can tolerate moderate label
noise, it has generally been acceptable for the accuracy of labels in large
training datasets to fall well short of a perfect 100%. However, when it comes
to testing DL models, achieving high label accuracy-as close to 100% as
possible-is paramount for reliable verification. In this article, we introduce
OPAL, a human-assisted labelling method that can be configured to target a
desired accuracy level while minimizing the manual effort required for
labelling. The main contribution of OPAL is a mixed-integer linear programming
(MILP) formulation that minimizes labelling effort subject to a specified
accuracy target. We evaluate OPAL for two tasks in the context of testing
vision systems: automatic labelling of test data and automated validation of
test data. Our evaluation, based on more than 2500 experiments performed on
seven datasets, comparing OPAL with eight baseline methods, shows that OPAL,
relying on its MILP formulation, achieves an average accuracy of 98.8%, just
1.2% below perfect accuracy, while cutting manual labelling by more than half.
Further, OPAL significantly outperforms automated labelling baselines in
labelling accuracy across all seven datasets, with large effect sizes, when all
methods are provided with the same manual-labelling budget. For automated
test-input validation, on average, OPAL reduces manual effort by 28.8% while
achieving 4.5% higher accuracy than the SOTA validation baselines. Finally, we
show that augmenting OPAL with an active learning loop leads to an additional
4.5% reduction in required manual labelling, without compromising accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的多模态对齐与融合框架，用于眼科诊断中处理缺失模态的问题，通过最优传输实现特征对齐，并在多种模态缺失场景下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球医疗资源分布不均导致临床中常遇到多模态数据缺失，影响诊断准确性，现有方法（如模态填补和蒸馏）存在局限性。

Method: 利用最优传输进行多尺度模态特征对齐（类别级和特征级），并提出非对称融合策略以利用OCT和眼底图像的不同特性。

Result: 在三个大型眼科多模态数据集上，模型在多种模态缺失场景下表现优异，达到Sota性能。

Conclusion: 所提框架能有效处理模态缺失问题，提升眼科诊断的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Multimodal ophthalmic imaging-based diagnosis integrates color fundus image
with optical coherence tomography (OCT) to provide a comprehensive view of
ocular pathologies. However, the uneven global distribution of healthcare
resources often results in real-world clinical scenarios encountering
incomplete multimodal data, which significantly compromises diagnostic
accuracy. Existing commonly used pipelines, such as modality imputation and
distillation methods, face notable limitations: 1)Imputation methods struggle
with accurately reconstructing key lesion features, since OCT lesions are
localized, while fundus images vary in style. 2)distillation methods rely
heavily on fully paired multimodal training data. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel multimodal alignment and fusion framework capable of
robustly handling missing modalities in the task of ophthalmic diagnostics. By
considering the distinctive feature characteristics of OCT and fundus images,
we emphasize the alignment of semantic features within the same category and
explicitly learn soft matching between modalities, allowing the missing
modality to utilize existing modality information, achieving robust cross-modal
feature alignment under the missing modality. Specifically, we leverage the
Optimal Transport for multi-scale modality feature alignment: class-wise
alignment through predicted class prototypes and feature-wise alignment via
cross-modal shared feature transport. Furthermore, we propose an asymmetric
fusion strategy that effectively exploits the distinct characteristics of OCT
and fundus modalities. Extensive evaluations on three large ophthalmic
multimodal datasets demonstrate our model's superior performance under various
modality-incomplete scenarios, achieving Sota performance in both complete
modality and inter-modality incompleteness conditions. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出CVS-AdaptNet，一种多标签适应策略，通过图像嵌入与文本描述对齐提升CVS识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CVS识别依赖高成本的空间标注，且现有多模态模型在多标签任务上表现不佳。

Method: 提出CVS-AdaptNet，利用正负提示对齐图像与文本，改进多标签分类。

Result: 在Endoscapes-CVS201数据集上达到57.6 mAP，优于基线6点。

Conclusion: 多模态框架结合文本提示可提升CVS识别，但需进一步研究以匹配空间标注方法。

Abstract: The Critical View of Safety (CVS) is crucial for safe laparoscopic
cholecystectomy, yet assessing CVS criteria remains a complex and challenging
task, even for experts. Traditional models for CVS recognition depend on
vision-only models learning with costly, labor-intensive spatial annotations.
This study investigates how text can be harnessed as a powerful tool for both
training and inference in multi-modal surgical foundation models to automate
CVS recognition. Unlike many existing multi-modal models, which are primarily
adapted for multi-class classification, CVS recognition requires a multi-label
framework. Zero-shot evaluation of existing multi-modal surgical models shows a
significant performance gap for this task. To address this, we propose
CVS-AdaptNet, a multi-label adaptation strategy that enhances fine-grained,
binary classification across multiple labels by aligning image embeddings with
textual descriptions of each CVS criterion using positive and negative prompts.
By adapting PeskaVLP, a state-of-the-art surgical foundation model, on the
Endoscapes-CVS201 dataset, CVS-AdaptNet achieves 57.6 mAP, improving over the
ResNet50 image-only baseline (51.5 mAP) by 6 points. Our results show that
CVS-AdaptNet's multi-label, multi-modal framework, enhanced by textual prompts,
boosts CVS recognition over image-only methods. We also propose text-specific
inference methods, that helps in analysing the image-text alignment. While
further work is needed to match state-of-the-art spatial annotation-based
methods, this approach highlights the potential of adapting generalist models
to specialized surgical tasks. Code:

TL;DR: MML-SurgAdapt是一个基于视觉语言模型（VLMs）的统一多任务框架，用于处理多样化的外科任务，通过自然语言监督和单正多标签（SPML）学习解决部分标注问题，减少标注负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型针对单一任务缺乏灵活性，需要为每个任务单独构建模型，增加了复杂性和标注负担。

Method: 引入MML-SurgAdapt框架，利用CLIP模型和SPML学习，整合多个外科任务的数据，支持自然语言监督。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现与任务专用基准相当，且优于现有SPML框架，标注需求减少23%。

Conclusion: MML-SurgAdapt为外科计算机视觉中的多任务学习提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案，首次将SPML应用于多任务数据整合。

Abstract: Surgical AI often involves multiple tasks within a single procedure, like
phase recognition or assessing the Critical View of Safety in laparoscopic
cholecystectomy. Traditional models, built for one task at a time, lack
flexibility, requiring a separate model for each. To address this, we introduce
MML-SurgAdapt, a unified multi-task framework with Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), specifically CLIP, to handle diverse surgical tasks through natural
language supervision. A key challenge in multi-task learning is the presence of
partial annotations when integrating different tasks. To overcome this, we
employ Single Positive Multi-Label (SPML) learning, which traditionally reduces
annotation burden by training models with only one positive label per instance.
Our framework extends this approach to integrate data from multiple surgical
tasks within a single procedure, enabling effective learning despite incomplete
or noisy annotations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on a
combined dataset consisting of Cholec80, Endoscapes2023, and CholecT50,
utilizing custom prompts. Extensive evaluation shows that MML-SurgAdapt
performs comparably to task-specific benchmarks, with the added advantage of
handling noisy annotations. It also outperforms the existing SPML frameworks
for the task. By reducing the required labels by 23%, our approach proposes a
more scalable and efficient labeling process, significantly easing the
annotation burden on clinicians. To our knowledge, this is the first
application of SPML to integrate data from multiple surgical tasks, presenting
a novel and generalizable solution for multi-task learning in surgical computer
vision. Implementation is available at:

Motivation: 惯性质量在机器人应用中至关重要，但仅通过视觉传感器估计质量的研究较少。

Method: 结合深度图像的稀疏点云数据和RGB图像，利用合成数据集训练深度估计模型，并增强现有数据集。

Result: 方法在所有评估指标上显著优于现有基准。

Conclusion: 该方法为机器人任务中的质量估计提供了有效解决方案，相关代码已开源。

Abstract: Inertial mass plays a crucial role in robotic applications such as object
grasping, manipulation, and simulation, providing a strong prior for planning
and control. Accurately estimating an object's mass before interaction can
significantly enhance the performance of various robotic tasks. However, mass
estimation using only vision sensors is a relatively underexplored area. This
paper proposes a novel approach combining sparse point-cloud data from depth
images with RGB images to estimate the mass of objects. We evaluate a range of
point-cloud processing architectures, alongside RGB-only methods. To overcome
the limited availability of training data, we create a synthetic dataset using
ShapeNetSem 3D models, simulating RGBD images via a Kinect camera. This
synthetic data is used to train an image generation model for estimating dense
depth maps, which we then use to augment an existing dataset of images paired
with mass values. Our approach significantly outperforms existing benchmarks
across all evaluated metrics. The data generation
(https://github.com/RavineWindteer/ShapenetSem-to-RGBD) as well as the training
of the depth estimator (https://github.com/RavineWindteer/GLPDepth-Edited) and
the mass estimator (https://github.com/RavineWindteer/Depth-mass-estimator) are

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为INTER的训练无关算法，通过引导大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）有效利用多模态交互信息，减少幻觉现象，在多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）在生成响应时可能产生与视觉内容不一致的幻觉，而人类认知中很少出现此问题。作者认为人类能有效利用多模态交互信息，因此尝试在LVLM中模拟这一行为。

Method: 提出INTER算法，通过显式引导LVLM在生成响应时重新利用多模态交互信息，无需额外数据或训练。

Result: 在六个基准测试（包括VQA和图像描述任务）中，INTER在五种LVLM上平均提升了3.4%，优于现有解码策略。

Conclusion: INTER通过模拟人类多模态信息处理方式，显著减少了LVLM的幻觉现象，且无需额外训练或数据。

Abstract: Hallucinations in large vision-language models (LVLMs) pose significant
challenges for real-world applications, as LVLMs may generate responses that
appear plausible yet remain inconsistent with the associated visual content.
This issue rarely occurs in human cognition. We argue that this discrepancy
arises from humans' ability to effectively leverage multimodal interaction
information in data samples. Specifically, humans typically first gather
multimodal information, analyze the interactions across modalities for
understanding, and then express their understanding through language. Motivated
by this observation, we conduct extensive experiments on popular LVLMs and
obtained insights that surprisingly reveal human-like, though less pronounced,
cognitive behavior of LVLMs on multimodal samples. Building on these findings,
we further propose \textbf{INTER}: \textbf{Inter}action Guidance Sampling, a
novel training-free algorithm that mitigate hallucinations without requiring
additional data. Specifically, INTER explicitly guides LVLMs to effectively
reapply their understanding of multimodal interaction information when
generating responses, thereby reducing potential hallucinations. On six
benchmarks including VQA and image captioning tasks, INTER achieves an average
improvement of up to 3.4\% on five LVLMs compared to the state-of-the-art
decoding strategy. The code will be released when the paper is accepted.

Motivation: 生物医学数据集样本不平衡且隐私限制严格，阻碍机器学习模型发展，合成图像可改善数据可用性并保护隐私。

Method: 使用LoRA权重微调的稳定扩散模型生成合成白细胞图像，结合少量真实样本指导，训练ResNet和CLIP分类器。

Conclusion: 合成图像是生物医学研究的有效工具，可提升模型性能，助力医学诊断与研究。

Abstract: Biomedical datasets often contain a large sample imbalance and are subject to
strict privacy constraints, which together hinder the development of accurate
machine learning models. One potential solution is to generate synthetic
images, as this can improve data availability while preserving patient privacy.
However, it remains difficult to generate synthetic images of sufficient
quality for training robust classifiers. In this work, we focus on the
classification of single white blood cells, a key component in the diagnosis of
hematological diseases such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a severe blood
cancer. We demonstrate how synthetic images generated with a fine-tuned stable
diffusion model using LoRA weights when guided by real few-shot samples of the
target white blood cell classes, can enhance classifier performance for limited
data. When training a ResNet classifier, accuracy increased from 27.3\% to
78.4\% (+51.1\%) by adding 5000 synthetic images per class to a small and
highly imbalanced real dataset. For a CLIP-based classifier, the accuracy
improved from 61.8\% to 76.8\% (+15.0\%). The synthetic images are highly
similar to real images, and they can help overcome dataset limitations,
enhancing model generalization. Our results establish synthetic images as a
tool in biomedical research, improving machine learning models, and
facilitating medical diagnosis and research.

Abstract: Autoregressive image generation has witnessed rapid advancements, with
prominent models such as scale-wise visual auto-regression pushing the
boundaries of visual synthesis. However, these developments also raise
significant concerns regarding data privacy and copyright. In response,
training data detection has emerged as a critical task for identifying
unauthorized data usage in model training. To better understand the
vulnerability of autoregressive image generative models to such detection, we
conduct the first study applying membership inference to this domain. Our
approach comprises two key components: implicit classification and an adaptive
score aggregation strategy. First, we compute the implicit token-wise
classification score within the query image. Then we propose an adaptive score
aggregation strategy to acquire a final score, which places greater emphasis on
the tokens with lower scores. A higher final score indicates that the sample is
more likely to be involved in the training set. To validate the effectiveness
of our method, we adapt existing detection algorithms originally designed for
LLMs to visual autoregressive models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of our method in both class-conditional and text-to-image
scenarios. Moreover, our approach exhibits strong robustness and generalization
under various data transformations. Furthermore, sufficient experiments suggest
two novel key findings: (1) A linear scaling law on membership inference,
exposing the vulnerability of large foundation models. (2) Training data from
scale-wise visual autoregressive models is easier to detect than other
autoregressive paradigms.Our code is available at

Motivation: 音频驱动说话头生成在虚拟助手、游戏和电影中至关重要，但现有方法存在时间抖动、身份漂移和不自然眨眼等问题。

Method: 结合3DMM与扩散Transformer，采用分层去噪策略、3DMM系数和优化的眨眼策略。

Result: 有效减少时间抖动，保持身份一致性，并生成更自然的眨眼行为。

Conclusion: MoDiT框架显著提升了音频驱动说话头生成的质量和一致性。

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head generation is critical for applications such as
virtual assistants, video games, and films, where natural lip movements are
essential. Despite progress in this field, challenges remain in producing both
consistent and realistic facial animations. Existing methods, often based on
GANs or UNet-based diffusion models, face three major limitations: (i) temporal
jittering caused by weak temporal constraints, resulting in frame
inconsistencies; (ii) identity drift due to insufficient 3D information
extraction, leading to poor preservation of facial identity; and (iii)
unnatural blinking behavior due to inadequate modeling of realistic blink
dynamics. To address these issues, we propose MoDiT, a novel framework that
combines the 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) with a Diffusion-based Transformer. Our
contributions include: (i) A hierarchical denoising strategy with revised
temporal attention and biased self/cross-attention mechanisms, enabling the
model to refine lip synchronization and progressively enhance full-face
coherence, effectively mitigating temporal jittering. (ii) The integration of
3DMM coefficients to provide explicit spatial constraints, ensuring accurate
3D-informed optical flow prediction and improved lip synchronization using
Wav2Lip results, thereby preserving identity consistency. (iii) A refined
blinking strategy to model natural eye movements, with smoother and more
realistic blinking behaviors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史文档因撕裂、水蚀和氧化严重退化，现有方法无法满足实际需求。

Method: AutoHDR采用三阶段方法：OCR辅助损伤定位、视觉-语言上下文文本预测和补丁自回归外观修复。

Result: AutoHDR将严重损坏文档的OCR准确率从46.83%提升至84.05%，人机协作下可达94.25%。

Conclusion: AutoHDR在自动化历史文档修复领域取得显著进展，对文化遗产保护有重要贡献。

Abstract: Historical documents represent an invaluable cultural heritage, yet have
undergone significant degradation over time through tears, water erosion, and
oxidation. Existing Historical Document Restoration (HDR) methods primarily
focus on single modality or limited-size restoration, failing to meet practical
needs. To fill this gap, we present a full-page HDR dataset (FPHDR) and a novel
automated HDR solution (AutoHDR). Specifically, FPHDR comprises 1,633 real and
6,543 synthetic images with character-level and line-level locations, as well
as character annotations in different damage grades. AutoHDR mimics historians'
restoration workflows through a three-stage approach: OCR-assisted damage
localization, vision-language context text prediction, and patch autoregressive
appearance restoration. The modular architecture of AutoHDR enables seamless
human-machine collaboration, allowing for flexible intervention and
optimization at each restoration stage. Experiments demonstrate AutoHDR's
remarkable performance in HDR. When processing severely damaged documents, our
method improves OCR accuracy from 46.83\% to 84.05\%, with further enhancement
to 94.25\% through human-machine collaboration. We believe this work represents
a significant advancement in automated historical document restoration and
contributes substantially to cultural heritage preservation. The model and
dataset are available at https://github.com/SCUT-DLVCLab/AutoHDR.

Conclusion: VOTE框架高效且通用，代码将开源。

Abstract: Recent large-scale Vision Language Action (VLA) models have shown superior
performance in robotic manipulation tasks guided by natural language. However,
their generalization remains limited when applied to novel objects or
unfamiliar environments that lie outside the training distribution. To address
this, many existing approaches integrate additional components such as depth
estimation, segmentation, or even diffusion to improve generalization, at the
cost of adding significant computation overhead, resulting in low efficiency.
This motivates the exploration of efficient action prediction methods, which
are independent of additional high-level visual representations or diffusion
techniques. In this work, we propose VOTE, an efficient and general framework
for the optimization and acceleration of VLA models. In details, we propose a
novel tokenizer-free fine-tuning approach for parallel accurate action
prediction, which reduces computational overhead and accelerates inference
speed. Additionally, we adopt an ensemble voting strategy for the action
sampling, which significantly improves model performance and enhances
generalization. Experimental results show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance with 35$\times$ faster inference and 145 Hz
throughput. All the details and codes will be open-sourced.

Abstract: The widespread and rapid adoption of AI-generated content, created by models
such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models, has
revolutionized the digital media landscape by allowing efficient and creative
content generation. However, these models also blur the difference between real
images and AI-generated synthetic images, raising concerns regarding content
authenticity and integrity. While many existing solutions to detect fake images
focus solely on classification and higher-resolution images, they often lack
transparency in their decision-making, making it difficult for users to
understand why an image is classified as fake. In this paper, we present
VERITAS, a comprehensive framework that not only accurately detects whether a
small (32x32) image is AI-generated but also explains why it was classified
that way through artifact localization and semantic reasoning. VERITAS produces
human-readable explanations that describe key artifacts in synthetic images. We
show that this architecture offers clear explanations of the basis of zero-shot
synthetic image detection tasks. Code and relevant prompts can be found at

Abstract: The recent proliferation of photorealistic AI-generated images (AIGI) has
raised urgent concerns about their potential misuse, particularly on social
media platforms. Current state-of-the-art AIGI detection methods typically rely
on large, deep neural architectures, creating significant computational
barriers to real-time, large-scale deployment on platforms like social media.
To challenge this reliance on computationally intensive models, we introduce
LAID, the first framework -- to our knowledge -- that benchmarks and evaluates
the detection performance and efficiency of off-the-shelf lightweight neural
networks. In this framework, we comprehensively train and evaluate selected
models on a representative subset of the GenImage dataset across spatial,
spectral, and fusion image domains. Our results demonstrate that lightweight
models can achieve competitive accuracy, even under adversarial conditions,
while incurring substantially lower memory and computation costs compared to
current state-of-the-art methods. This study offers valuable insight into the
trade-off between efficiency and performance in AIGI detection and lays a
foundation for the development of practical, scalable, and trustworthy
detection systems. The source code of LAID can be found at:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统4D捕获系统帧率低（<30 FPS）导致高速运动重建效果不佳的问题。

Conclusion: 无需高速相机，仅用低帧率相机即可实现高质量高速4D重建。

Abstract: Reconstructing fast-dynamic scenes from multi-view videos is crucial for
high-speed motion analysis and realistic 4D reconstruction. However, the
majority of 4D capture systems are limited to frame rates below 30 FPS (frames
per second), and a direct 4D reconstruction of high-speed motion from low FPS
input may lead to undesirable results. In this work, we propose a high-speed 4D
capturing system only using low FPS cameras, through novel capturing and
processing modules. On the capturing side, we propose an asynchronous capture
scheme that increases the effective frame rate by staggering the start times of
cameras. By grouping cameras and leveraging a base frame rate of 25 FPS, our
method achieves an equivalent frame rate of 100-200 FPS without requiring
specialized high-speed cameras. On processing side, we also propose a novel
generative model to fix artifacts caused by 4D sparse-view reconstruction, as
asynchrony reduces the number of viewpoints at each timestamp. Specifically, we
propose to train a video-diffusion-based artifact-fix model for sparse 4D
reconstruction, which refines missing details, maintains temporal consistency,
and improves overall reconstruction quality. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method significantly enhances high-speed 4D reconstruction compared to
synchronous capture.

Method: 结合LLaVA生成文本和CLIP嵌入，采用Guided CA和Differential Attention机制优化多模态特征融合。

Result: 在CrisisMMD数据集上，该方法在分类准确率上优于现有模型，提升了灾难响应任务的可靠性。

Conclusion: 预训练VLMs、增强文本描述和自适应融合策略的组合显著提升了危机事件多模态分类性能。

Abstract: Social networks can be a valuable source of information during crisis events.
In particular, users can post a stream of multimodal data that can be critical
for real-time humanitarian response. However, effectively extracting meaningful
information from this large and noisy data stream and effectively integrating
heterogeneous data remains a formidable challenge. In this work, we explore
vision language models (VLMs) and advanced fusion strategies to enhance the
classification of crisis data in three different tasks. We incorporate
LLaVA-generated text to improve text-image alignment. Additionally, we leverage
Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP)-based vision and text embeddings,
which, without task-specific fine-tuning, outperform traditional models. To
further refine multimodal fusion, we employ Guided Cross Attention (Guided CA)
and combine it with the Differential Attention mechanism to enhance feature
alignment by emphasizing critical information while filtering out irrelevant
content. Our results show that while Differential Attention improves
classification performance, Guided CA remains highly effective in aligning
multimodal features. Extensive experiments on the CrisisMMD benchmark data set
demonstrate that the combination of pretrained VLMs, enriched textual
descriptions, and adaptive fusion strategies consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art models in classification accuracy, contributing to more
reliable and interpretable models for three different tasks that are crucial
for disaster response. Our code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统帧插值任务局限于少量帧和无文本控制，且缺乏官方定义和基准。本文旨在填补这一空白，支持多帧率和文本控制。

Method: 基于Wan2.1构建SemFi模型，引入Mixture-of-LoRA模块，确保生成内容在多种帧长度限制下与控制条件一致。

Conclusion: 本文提出的SFI任务、SemFi模型和SFI-300K数据集为帧插值领域提供了新的研究方向和基准。

Abstract: Generating intermediate video content of varying lengths based on given first
and last frames, along with text prompt information, offers significant
research and application potential. However, traditional frame interpolation
tasks primarily focus on scenarios with a small number of frames, no text
control, and minimal differences between the first and last frames. Recent
community developers have utilized large video models represented by Wan to
endow frame-to-frame capabilities. However, these models can only generate a
fixed number of frames and often fail to produce satisfactory results for
certain frame lengths, while this setting lacks a clear official definition and
a well-established benchmark. In this paper, we first propose a new practical
Semantic Frame Interpolation (SFI) task from the perspective of academic
definition, which covers the above two settings and supports inference at
multiple frame rates. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel SemFi model
building upon Wan2.1, which incorporates a Mixture-of-LoRA module to ensure the
generation of high-consistency content that aligns with control conditions
across various frame length limitations. Furthermore, we propose SFI-300K, the
first general-purpose dataset and benchmark specifically designed for SFI. To
support this, we collect and process data from the perspective of SFI,
carefully designing evaluation metrics and methods to assess the model's
performance across multiple dimensions, encompassing image and video, and
various aspects, including consistency and diversity. Through extensive
experiments on SFI-300K, we demonstrate that our method is particularly
well-suited to meet the requirements of the SFI task.

Abstract: Characterizing quantum flakes is a critical step in quantum hardware
engineering because the quality of these flakes directly influences qubit
performance. Although computer vision methods for identifying two-dimensional
quantum flakes have emerged, they still face significant challenges in
estimating flake thickness. These challenges include limited data, poor
generalization, sensitivity to domain shifts, and a lack of physical
interpretability. In this paper, we introduce one of the first Physics-informed
Adaptation Learning approaches to overcome these obstacles. We focus on two
main issues, i.e., data scarcity and generalization. First, we propose a new
synthetic data generation framework that produces diverse quantum flake samples
across various materials and configurations, reducing the need for
time-consuming manual collection. Second, we present $\varphi$-Adapt, a
physics-informed adaptation method that bridges the performance gap between
models trained on synthetic data and those deployed in real-world settings.
Experimental results show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance on multiple benchmarks, outperforming existing methods. Our
proposed approach advances the integration of physics-based modeling and domain
adaptation. It also addresses a critical gap in leveraging synthesized data for
real-world 2D material analysis, offering impactful tools for deep learning and
materials science communities.

Motivation: 传统遥感方法难以应对碎片化农业景观的时空异质性，因此需要一种适应本地农业生态变化的监测方法。

Method: 采用物候驱动的分类框架，针对32个地区进行本地化校准，结合遥感与地面数据验证。

Conclusion: 研究证明，遥感框架应适应而非简化景观复杂性，为区域农业监测提供了科学且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate rice area monitoring is critical for food security and agricultural
policy in smallholder farming regions, yet conventional remote sensing
approaches struggle with the spatiotemporal heterogeneity characteristic of
fragmented agricultural landscapes. This study developed a phenology-driven
classification framework that systematically adapts to local agro-ecological
variations across 32 districts in Telangana, India during the 2018-19 Rabi rice
season. The research reveals significant spatiotemporal diversity, with
phenological timing varying by up to 50 days between districts and field sizes
ranging from 0.01 to 2.94 hectares. Our district-specific calibration approach
achieved 93.3% overall accuracy, an 8.0 percentage point improvement over
conventional regional clustering methods, with strong validation against
official government statistics (R^2 = 0.981) demonstrating excellent agreement
between remotely sensed and ground truth data. The framework successfully
mapped 732,345 hectares by adapting to agro-climatic variations, with Northern
districts requiring extended land preparation phases (up to 55 days) while
Southern districts showed compressed cultivation cycles. Field size analysis
revealed accuracy declining 6.8 percentage points from medium to tiny fields,
providing insights for operational monitoring in fragmented landscapes. These
findings demonstrate that remote sensing frameworks must embrace rather than
simplify landscape complexity, advancing region-specific agricultural
monitoring approaches that maintain scientific rigor while serving practical
policy and food security applications.

Conclusion: VDG-Uni3DSeg为3D场景理解提供了可扩展且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Unified segmentation of 3D point clouds is crucial for scene understanding,
but is hindered by its sparse structure, limited annotations, and the challenge
of distinguishing fine-grained object classes in complex environments. Existing
methods often struggle to capture rich semantic and contextual information due
to limited supervision and a lack of diverse multimodal cues, leading to
suboptimal differentiation of classes and instances. To address these
challenges, we propose VDG-Uni3DSeg, a novel framework that integrates
pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) and large language models
(LLMs) to enhance 3D segmentation. By leveraging LLM-generated textual
descriptions and reference images from the internet, our method incorporates
rich multimodal cues, facilitating fine-grained class and instance separation.
We further design a Semantic-Visual Contrastive Loss to align point features
with multimodal queries and a Spatial Enhanced Module to model scene-wide
relationships efficiently. Operating within a closed-set paradigm that utilizes
multimodal knowledge generated offline, VDG-Uni3DSeg achieves state-of-the-art
results in semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation, offering a scalable
and practical solution for 3D understanding. Our code is available at

Method: CTA利用多模态对比学习，对齐监督编码器和自监督编码器的表示，避免梯度干扰并保留自监督学习的鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，CTA在多个基准数据集上显著提升了鲁棒性和泛化能力，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CTA无需专用架构即可有效提升TTT性能，为模型鲁棒性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Deep learning models have demonstrated exceptional performance across a wide
range of computer vision tasks. However, their performance often degrades
significantly when faced with distribution shifts, such as domain or dataset
changes. Test-Time Training (TTT) has emerged as an effective method to enhance
model robustness by incorporating an auxiliary unsupervised task during
training and leveraging it for model updates at test time. In this work, we
introduce CTA (Cross-Task Alignment), a novel approach for improving TTT.
Unlike existing TTT methods, CTA does not require a specialized model
architecture and instead takes inspiration from the success of multi-modal
contrastive learning to align a supervised encoder with a self-supervised one.
This process enforces alignment between the learned representations of both
models, thereby mitigating the risk of gradient interference, preserving the
intrinsic robustness of self-supervised learning and enabling more semantically
meaningful updates at test-time. Experimental results demonstrate substantial
improvements in robustness and generalization over the state-of-the-art on
several benchmark datasets.

Motivation: 在低帧率无人机视频中，由于物体外观和位置的快速变化以及图像质量下降，多目标跟踪任务变得复杂。

Method: 通过从单帧标注中学习实例关联，利用场景的全局特征提供上下文，提高关联的鲁棒性。

Result: 该方法在降低输入图像分辨率和潜在表示大小的情况下仍保持高关联质量，并提出了一个军事车辆标注数据集。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂场景中表现出色，为低帧率无人机视频的多目标跟踪提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) aims to maintain consistent identities of objects
across video frames. Associating objects in low-frame-rate videos captured by
moving unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in actual combat scenarios is complex
due to rapid changes in object appearance and position within the frame. The
task becomes even more challenging due to image degradation caused by cloud
video streaming and compression algorithms. We present how instance association
learning from single-frame annotations can overcome these challenges. We show
that global features of the scene provide crucial context for low-FPS instance
association, allowing our solution to be robust to distractors and gaps in
detections. We also demonstrate that such a tracking approach maintains high
association quality even when reducing the input image resolution and latent
representation size for faster inference. Finally, we present a benchmark
dataset of annotated military vehicles collected from publicly available data
sources. This paper was initially presented at the NATO Science and Technology
Organization Symposium (ICMCIS) organized by the Information Systems Technology

Conclusion: 该方法为多领域信号分离问题提供了通用解决方案。

Abstract: Significant challenges exist in efficient data analysis of most advanced
experimental and observational techniques because the collected signals often
include unwanted contributions--such as background and signal distortions--that
can obscure the physically relevant information of interest. To address this,
we have developed a self-supervised machine-learning approach for source
separation using a dual implicit neural representation framework that jointly
trains two neural networks: one for approximating distortions of the physical
signal of interest and the other for learning the effective background
contribution. Our method learns directly from the raw data by minimizing a
reconstruction-based loss function without requiring labeled data or
pre-defined dictionaries. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by
considering a challenging case study involving large-scale simulated as well as
experimental momentum-energy-dependent inelastic neutron scattering data in a
four-dimensional parameter space, characterized by heterogeneous background
contributions and unknown distortions to the target signal. The method is found
to successfully separate physically meaningful signals from a complex or
structured background even when the signal characteristics vary across all four
dimensions of the parameter space. An analytical approach that informs the
choice of the regularization parameter is presented. Our method offers a
versatile framework for addressing source separation problems across diverse
domains, ranging from superimposed signals in astronomical measurements to
structural features in biomedical image reconstructions.

Abstract: Accurate motion prediction of surrounding traffic participants is crucial for
the safe and efficient operation of automated vehicles in dynamic environments.
Marginal prediction models commonly forecast each agent's future trajectories
independently, often leading to sub-optimal planning decisions for an automated
vehicle. In contrast, joint prediction models explicitly account for the
interactions between agents, yielding socially and physically consistent
predictions on a scene level. However, existing approaches differ not only in
their problem formulation but also in the model architectures and
implementation details used, making it difficult to compare them. In this work,
we systematically investigate different approaches to joint motion prediction,
including post-processing of the marginal predictions, explicitly training the
model for joint predictions, and framing the problem as a generative task. We
evaluate each approach in terms of prediction accuracy, multi-modality, and
inference efficiency, offering a comprehensive analysis of the strengths and
limitations of each approach. Several prediction examples are available at

Abstract: The remarkable reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) stems
from cognitive behaviors that emerge through reinforcement with verifiable
rewards. This work investigates how to transfer this principle to Multimodal
LLMs (MLLMs) to unlock advanced visual reasoning. We introduce a two-stage
paradigm built on Qwen2.5-VL-7B: a massive linguistic cold-start fine-tuning,
followed by multimodal reinforcement learning (RL) spanning nearly 1,000 steps,
surpassing all previous open-source efforts in scale. This pioneering work
reveals three fundamental insights: 1) Behavior transfer emerges surprisingly
early in cold start due to linguistic mental imagery. 2) Cold start broadly
memorizes visual behaviors, while RL critically discerns and scales up
effective patterns. 3) Transfer strategically favors high-utility behaviors
such as visual reflection. Our resulting model, Open-Vision-Reasoner (OVR),
achieves state-of-the-art performance on a suite of reasoning benchmarks,
including 95.3% on MATH500, 51.8% on MathVision and 54.6% on MathVerse. We
release our model, data, and training dynamics to catalyze the development of
more capable, behavior-aligned multimodal reasoners.

Result: 实验表明SegmentDreamer在视觉质量上优于现有方法，支持高保真3D资产生成。

Conclusion: SegmentDreamer通过SCTD有效解决了CD方法的局限性，实现了高质量的文本到3D生成。

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-3D generation improve the visual quality of
Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) and its variants by directly connecting
Consistency Distillation (CD) to score distillation. However, due to the
imbalance between self-consistency and cross-consistency, these CD-based
methods inherently suffer from improper conditional guidance, leading to
sub-optimal generation results. To address this issue, we present
SegmentDreamer, a novel framework designed to fully unleash the potential of
consistency models for high-fidelity text-to-3D generation. Specifically, we
reformulate SDS through the proposed Segmented Consistency Trajectory
Distillation (SCTD), effectively mitigating the imbalance issues by explicitly
defining the relationship between self- and cross-consistency. Moreover, SCTD
partitions the Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE)
trajectory into multiple sub-trajectories and ensures consistency within each
segment, which can theoretically provide a significantly tighter upper bound on
distillation error. Additionally, we propose a distillation pipeline for a more
swift and stable generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
SegmentDreamer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual quality, enabling
high-fidelity 3D asset creation through 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS).

Conclusion: ST-LLM通过改进时空理解能力，为智能体在现实世界中的应用提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the significant recent progress of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), MLLMs still struggle to correctly answer prompts that require a
holistic spatio-temporal understanding. Specifically, it is challenging to
address prompts that refer to 1) the entirety of an environment that an agent
equipped with an MLLM can operate in; and simultaneously also refer to 2)
recent actions that just happened and are encoded in a video clip. However,
such a holistic spatio-temporal understanding is important for agents operating
in the real world. To address this issue, we first develop a framework to
collect a large-scale dataset. Using the collected "Reasoning about
Environments and Actions" (REA) dataset, we show that recent methods indeed
struggle to correctly answer the prompts. To improve, we develop a
"spatio-temporal LLM" (ST-LLM), a model equipped with projectors to improve
both spatial understanding of an environment and temporal understanding of
recent observations. On the collected REA data, we show that the proposed
method significantly improves results compared to prior work. Code and data are

Abstract: Recent diffusion-based image editing methods have significantly advanced

preservation, unintended edits, or rely heavily on manual masks. To address
these challenges, we introduce X-Planner, a Multimodal Large Language Model

model capabilities. X-Planner employs chain-of-thought reasoning to
systematically decompose complex instructions into simpler, clear
sub-instructions. For each sub-instruction, X-Planner automatically generates
precise edit types and segmentation masks, eliminating manual intervention and
ensuring localized, identity-preserving edits. Additionally, we propose a novel
automated pipeline for generating large-scale data to train X-Planner which
achieves state-of-the-art results on both existing benchmarks and our newly
introduced complex editing benchmark.

Abstract: LiDAR representation learning aims to extract rich structural and semantic
information from large-scale, readily available datasets, reducing reliance on
costly human annotations. However, existing LiDAR representation strategies
often overlook the inherent spatiotemporal cues in LiDAR sequences, limiting
their effectiveness. In this work, we propose LiMA, a novel long-term
image-to-LiDAR Memory Aggregation framework that explicitly captures longer
range temporal correlations to enhance LiDAR representation learning. LiMA
comprises three key components: 1) a Cross-View Aggregation module that aligns
and fuses overlapping regions across neighboring camera views, constructing a
more unified and redundancy-free memory bank; 2) a Long-Term Feature
Propagation mechanism that efficiently aligns and integrates multi-frame image
features, reinforcing temporal coherence during LiDAR representation learning;
and 3) a Cross-Sequence Memory Alignment strategy that enforces consistency
across driving sequences, improving generalization to unseen environments. LiMA
maintains high pretraining efficiency and incurs no additional computational
overhead during downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on mainstream
LiDAR-based perception benchmarks demonstrate that LiMA significantly improves
both LiDAR semantic segmentation and 3D object detection. We hope this work
inspires more effective pretraining paradigms for autonomous driving. The code
has be made publicly accessible for future research.

*Lisa Herzog,Pascal Bühler,Ezequiel de la Rosa,Beate Sick,Susanne Wegener*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 研究开发了可解释的深度学习模型，结合临床数据和影像学信息，预测大血管闭塞（LVO）卒中患者的功能性结果和治疗效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管机械取栓已成为LVO卒中的标准治疗，但仅50%成功治疗患者有良好预后，需改进预测方法。

Method: 利用449名患者的临床数据和影像学信息（NCCT和CTA），通过深度学习模型预测功能结果和个体化治疗效果（ITE）。

Result: 临床变量对预测有较好效果（AUC 0.719），加入CTA影像略有提升（AUC 0.737），但NCCT无额外帮助。ITE估计校准良好但区分能力有限。

Conclusion: 模型整合了影像和临床数据，预测性能优异，但ITE估计仍需改进。

Abstract: Mechanical thrombectomy has become the standard of care in patients with
stroke due to large vessel occlusion (LVO). However, only 50% of successfully
treated patients show a favorable outcome. We developed and evaluated
interpretable deep learning models to predict functional outcomes in terms of
the modified Rankin Scale score alongside individualized treatment effects
(ITEs) using data of 449 LVO stroke patients from a randomized clinical trial.
Besides clinical variables, we considered non-contrast CT (NCCT) and
angiography (CTA) scans which were integrated using novel foundation models to
make use of advanced imaging information. Clinical variables had a good
predictive power for binary functional outcome prediction (AUC of 0.719 [0.666,
0.774]) which could slightly be improved when adding CTA imaging (AUC of 0.737
[0.687, 0.795]). Adding NCCT scans or a combination of NCCT and CTA scans to
clinical features yielded no improvement. The most important clinical predictor
for functional outcome was pre-stroke disability. While estimated ITEs were
well calibrated to the average treatment effect, discriminatory ability was
limited indicated by a C-for-Benefit statistic of around 0.55 in all models. In
summary, the models allowed us to jointly integrate CT imaging and clinical
features while achieving state-of-the-art prediction performance and ITE
estimates. Yet, further research is needed to particularly improve ITE
estimation.

*WenJie Cai,Qingguo Meng,Zhenyu Wang,Xingbo Dong,Zhe Jin*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: EvRWKV是一种新型框架，通过双域处理和跨模态交互，有效解决低光条件下图像增强的噪声和结构细节问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低光条件下图像质量差，传统方法噪声放大且细节丢失，事件相机虽有潜力但现有融合方法不足。

Method: 提出EvRWKV框架，包含Cross-RWKV模块和EISFE模块，分别用于跨模态融合和频域噪声抑制与空间对齐。

Result: 在多个真实低光数据集上表现优异，噪声抑制、细节恢复和视觉清晰度提升显著。

Conclusion: EvRWKV在低光图像增强中达到领先水平，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Capturing high-quality visual content under low-light conditions remains a
challenging problem due to severe noise, motion blur, and underexposure, which
degrade the performance of downstream applications. Traditional frame-based
low-light enhancement methods often amplify noise or fail to preserve
structural details, especially in real-world scenarios. Event cameras, offering
high dynamic range and microsecond temporal resolution by asynchronously
capturing brightness changes, emerge as promising alternatives for low-light
imaging. However, existing event-image fusion methods suffer from simplistic
fusion strategies and inadequate handling of spatial-temporal misalignment and
noise. To address these challenges, we propose EvRWKV, a novel framework that
enables continuous cross-modal interaction through dual-domain processing. Our
approach incorporates a Cross-RWKV module, leveraging the Receptance Weighted
Key Value (RWKV) architecture for fine-grained temporal and cross-modal fusion,
and an Event Image Spectral Fusion Enhancer (EISFE) module, which jointly
performs adaptive frequency-domain noise suppression and spatial-domain
deformable convolution alignment. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
evaluations on real-world low-light datasets(SDE, SDSD, RELED) demonstrate that
EvRWKV achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively enhancing image
quality by suppressing noise, restoring structural details, and improving
visual clarity in challenging low-light conditions.

*Mingxuan Cai,Dekel Galor,Amit Pal Singh Kohli,Jacob L. Yates,Laura Waller*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 通过事件相机改进主动传感方法，高效捕捉微小振动，实现多声源音频恢复，接近实时处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微小振动可揭示声音和材料属性等信息，但传统方法难以高效捕捉。

Method: 利用事件相机改进主动传感方法，高效记录快速运动，恢复音频。

Result: 在多声源和环境干扰下，音频恢复质量达到最优，处理速度接近实时。

Conclusion: 事件相机显著提升振动捕捉效率，为音频恢复提供快速解决方案。

Abstract: Small vibrations observed in video can unveil information beyond what is
visual, such as sound and material properties. It is possible to passively
record these vibrations when they are visually perceptible, or actively amplify
their visual contribution with a laser beam when they are not perceptible. In
this paper, we improve upon the active sensing approach by leveraging
event-based cameras, which are designed to efficiently capture fast motion. We
demonstrate our method experimentally by recovering audio from vibrations, even
for multiple simultaneous sources, and in the presence of environmental
distortions. Our approach matches the state-of-the-art reconstruction quality
at much faster speeds, approaching real-time processing.

### [247] [Towards Interpretable PolSAR Image Classification: Polarimetric Scattering Mechanism Informed Concept Bottleneck and Kolmogorov-Arnold Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03315)
*Jinqi Zhang,Fangzhou Han,Di Zhuang,Lamei Zhang,Bin Zou,Li Yuan*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合极化目标分解（PTD）和并行概念瓶颈网络（PaCBM）的方法，以提高深度学习在PolSAR图像分类中的可解释性，并通过Kolmogorov-Arnold网络（KAN）优化非线性建模能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在PolSAR图像分类中表现优异，但其“黑盒”特性导致特征解释和决策过程回溯困难。

Method: 通过构建极化概念标签和PaCBM网络，将高维特征转化为基于物理可验证散射机制的概念，并使用KAN替代MLP以简化映射过程。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保持高精度的同时实现了特征的概念化，并通过样条函数获得预测类别标签的解析功能。

Conclusion: 该方法推动了深度学习在PolSAR图像分类中的可解释性研究。

Abstract: In recent years, Deep Learning (DL) based methods have received extensive and
sufficient attention in the field of PolSAR image classification, which show
excellent performance. However, due to the ``black-box" nature of DL methods,
the interpretation of the high-dimensional features extracted and the
backtracking of the decision-making process based on the features are still
unresolved problems. In this study, we first highlight this issue and attempt
to achieve the interpretability analysis of DL-based PolSAR image
classification technology with the help of Polarimetric Target Decomposition
(PTD), a feature extraction method related to the scattering mechanism unique
to the PolSAR image processing field. In our work, by constructing the
polarimetric conceptual labels and a novel structure named Parallel Concept
Bottleneck Networks (PaCBM), the uninterpretable high-dimensional features are
transformed into human-comprehensible concepts based on physically verifiable
polarimetric scattering mechanisms. Then, the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN)
is used to replace Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for achieving a more concise
and understandable mapping process between layers and further enhanced
non-linear modeling ability. The experimental results on several PolSAR
datasets show that the features could be conceptualization under the premise of
achieving satisfactory accuracy through the proposed pipeline, and the
analytical function for predicting category labels from conceptual labels can
be obtained by combining spline functions, thus promoting the research on the
interpretability of the DL-based PolSAR image classification model.

*Rebeka Sultana,Hibiki Horibe,Tomoaki Murakami,Ikuko Shimizu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用深度学习模型检测高光谱图像中癌细胞细胞质的方法，并通过数据增强解决高光谱图像数据不足和噪声问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: H&E染色图像常用于检测细胞核或癌变区域，但CMOS图像缺乏诊断所需的详细信息，而高光谱图像提供更全面的细胞信息。然而，高光谱图像数据获取困难且常含噪声。

Method: 使用深度学习模型检测癌细胞细胞质，并提出数据增强方法以应对高光谱图像的噪声和数据不足问题，利用CMOS图像进行数据增强。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的数据增强方法在定量和定性上均有效。

Conclusion: 该方法通过数据增强有效解决了高光谱图像数据不足和噪声问题，提升了癌细胞细胞质检测的准确性。

Abstract: Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E)-stained images are commonly used to detect
nuclear or cancerous regions in cells from images captured by a microscope.
Identifying cancer cytoplasm is crucial for determining the type of cancer;
hence, obtaining accurate cancer cytoplasm regions in cell images is important.
While CMOS images often lack detailed information necessary for diagnosis,
hyperspectral images provide more comprehensive cell information. Using a deep
learning model, we propose a method for detecting cancer cell cytoplasm in
hyperspectral images. Deep learning models require large datasets for learning;
however, capturing a large number of hyperspectral images is difficult.
Additionally, hyperspectral images frequently contain instrumental noise,
depending on the characteristics of the imaging devices. We propose a data
augmentation method to account for instrumental noise. CMOS images were used
for data augmentation owing to their visual clarity, which facilitates manual
annotation compared to original hyperspectral images. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed data augmentation method both
quantitatively and qualitatively.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于GAN的fUS图像合成方法，通过架构改进提升生成图像的质量和生理合理性，解决了fUS数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: fUS技术因数据稀缺和图像生成限制，影响了其在临床中的应用潜力。

Method: 采用GAN框架，结合特征增强模块和归一化技术，优化fUS图像合成。

Result: 实验表明，该方法生成的图像质量高，且在数据增强任务中提升了分类准确性。

Conclusion: 该框架有效缓解了fUS数据不足问题，为临床和科研提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Functional ultrasound (fUS) is a neuroimaging technique known for its high
spatiotemporal resolution, enabling non-invasive observation of brain activity
through neurovascular coupling. Despite its potential in clinical applications
such as neonatal monitoring and intraoperative guidance, the development of fUS
faces challenges related to data scarcity and limitations in generating
realistic fUS images. This paper explores the use of a generative adversarial
network (GAN) framework tailored for fUS image synthesis. The proposed method
incorporates architectural enhancements, including feature enhancement modules
and normalization techniques, aiming to improve the fidelity and physiological
plausibility of generated images. The study evaluates the performance of the
framework against existing generative models, demonstrating its capability to
produce high-quality fUS images under various experimental conditions.
Additionally, the synthesized images are assessed for their utility in
downstream tasks, showing improvements in classification accuracy when used for
data augmentation. Experimental results are based on publicly available fUS
datasets, highlighting the framework's effectiveness in addressing data
limitations.

### [250] [Adaptive Gate-Aware Mamba Networks for Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03369)
*Tianyi Ding,Hongli Chen,Yang Gao,Zhuang Xiong,Feng Liu,Martijn A. Cloos,Hongfu Sun*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: GAST-Mamba是一种结合双Mamba编码器和GAST处理器的端到端框架，用于高效处理磁共振指纹（MRF）数据，解决了传统字典匹配的计算和内存问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统字典匹配（DM）在参数增加时计算和内存需求呈指数增长，限制了多参数映射的可扩展性。

Method: 提出GAST-Mamba框架，利用结构化状态空间模型高效捕获长程空间依赖，具有线性复杂度。

Result: 在5倍加速模拟MRF数据上，T1 PSNR达33.12 dB，优于SCQ；T2映射PSNR为30.62 dB，SSIM为0.9124。体内实验显示解剖细节改善和伪影减少。

Conclusion: GAST-Mamba为高度欠采样MRF采集提供了准确且鲁棒的解决方案，是可扩展的传统DM替代方法。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) enables fast quantitative imaging by
matching signal evolutions to a predefined dictionary. However, conventional
dictionary matching suffers from exponential growth in computational cost and
memory usage as the number of parameters increases, limiting its scalability to
multi-parametric mapping. To address this, recent work has explored deep
learning-based approaches as alternatives to DM. We propose GAST-Mamba, an
end-to-end framework that combines a dual Mamba-based encoder with a Gate-Aware
Spatial-Temporal (GAST) processor. Built on structured state-space models, our
architecture efficiently captures long-range spatial dependencies with linear
complexity. On 5 times accelerated simulated MRF data (200 frames), GAST-Mamba
achieved a T1 PSNR of 33.12~dB, outperforming SCQ (31.69~dB). For T2 mapping,
it reached a PSNR of 30.62~dB and SSIM of 0.9124. In vivo experiments further
demonstrated improved anatomical detail and reduced artifacts. Ablation studies
confirmed that each component contributes to performance, with the GAST module
being particularly important under strong undersampling. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of GAST-Mamba for accurate and robust
reconstruction from highly undersampled MRF acquisitions, offering a scalable
alternative to traditional DM-based methods.

### [251] [Hybrid-View Attention for csPCa Classification in TRUS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03421)
*Zetian Feng,Juan Fu,Xuebin Zou,Hongsheng Ye,Hong Wu,Jianhua Zhou,Yi Wang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的混合视图注意力（HVA）网络，用于在3D TRUS中分类临床显著前列腺癌（csPCa），结合了横向和矢状视图的互补信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 前列腺癌是男性癌症相关死亡的主要原因，准确识别临床显著前列腺癌对及时干预至关重要。TRUS的低对比度和各向异性空间分辨率带来了诊断挑战。

Method: 采用CNN-transformer混合架构，卷积层提取局部特征，基于transformer的HVA建模全局依赖关系。HVA包括视图内注意力和跨视图注意力，并通过混合视图自适应融合模块动态聚合特征。

Result: 在包含590名前列腺活检患者的内部数据集上进行了实验，比较和消融结果证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的HVA网络能够有效分类csPCa，代码已开源。

Abstract: Prostate cancer (PCa) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality in men,
and accurate identification of clinically significant PCa (csPCa) is critical
for timely intervention. Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) is widely used for
prostate biopsy; however, its low contrast and anisotropic spatial resolution
pose diagnostic challenges. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
hybrid-view attention (HVA) network for csPCa classification in 3D TRUS that
leverages complementary information from transverse and sagittal views. Our
approach integrates a CNN-transformer hybrid architecture, where convolutional
layers extract fine-grained local features and transformer-based HVA models
global dependencies. Specifically, the HVA comprises intra-view attention to
refine features within a single view and cross-view attention to incorporate
complementary information across views. Furthermore, a hybrid-view adaptive
fusion module dynamically aggregates features along both channel and spatial
dimensions, enhancing the overall representation. Experiments are conducted on
an in-house dataset containing 590 subjects who underwent prostate biopsy.
Comparative and ablation results prove the efficacy of our method. The code is
available at https://github.com/mock1ngbrd/HVAN.

### [252] [PhotIQA: A photoacoustic image data set with image quality ratings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03478)
*Anna Breger,Janek Gröhl,Clemens Karner,Thomas R Else,Ian Selby,Jonathan Weir-McCall,Carola-Bibiane Schönlieb*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个名为PhotIQA的数据集，用于开发和测试全参考和无参考图像质量评估（IQA）方法，特别针对光声成像（PAI）。数据集包含1134张专家评分的图像，并展示了HaarPSI$_{med}$在相关性上优于SSIM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏质量评分的医学图像，现有的IQA方法主要针对自然图像开发，但在医学图像（尤其是光声成像）中应用时存在不一致性。因此，需要专门的数据集和方法来评估医学图像质量。

Method: 研究者构建了PhotIQA数据集，包含1134张光声重建图像，由两位专家根据五个质量属性评分。数据集提供了高度特征化的测试对象作为参考，支持全参考评估。

Result: 实验结果表明，HaarPSI$_{med}$在相关性上显著优于SSIM（SRCC：0.83 vs. 0.62）。

Conclusion: PhotIQA数据集为光声成像的质量评估提供了重要资源，并展示了HaarPSI$_{med}$的优越性。数据集已公开可用。

Abstract: Image quality assessment (IQA) is crucial in the evaluation stage of novel
algorithms operating on images, including traditional and machine learning
based methods. Due to the lack of available quality-rated medical images, most
commonly used IQA methods employing reference images (i.e. full-reference IQA)
have been developed and tested for natural images. Reported application
inconsistencies arising when employing such measures for medical images are not
surprising, as they rely on different properties than natural images. In
photoacoustic imaging (PAI), especially, standard benchmarking approaches for
assessing the quality of image reconstructions are lacking. PAI is a
multi-physics imaging modality, in which two inverse problems have to be
solved, which makes the application of IQA measures uniquely challenging due to
both, acoustic and optical, artifacts.
  To support the development and testing of full- and no-reference IQA measures
we assembled PhotIQA, a data set consisting of 1134 reconstructed photoacoustic
(PA) images that were rated by 2 experts across five quality properties
(overall quality, edge visibility, homogeneity, inclusion and background
intensity), where the detailed rating enables usage beyond PAI. To allow
full-reference assessment, highly characterised imaging test objects were used,
providing a ground truth. Our baseline experiments show that HaarPSI$_{med}$
significantly outperforms SSIM in correlating with the quality ratings (SRCC:
0.83 vs. 0.62). The dataset is publicly available at
https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13325196.

### [253] [Dual-Alignment Knowledge Retention for Continual Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03638)
*Yuxin Ye,Yan Liu,Shujian Yu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的持续学习框架，通过双对齐策略（CNA和CRA模块）缓解医学图像分割中的灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学图像分割中因任务干扰导致的灾难性遗忘问题，现有方法未能捕捉任务间复杂依赖关系。

Method: 采用双对齐策略：CNA模块对齐当前与历史网络的特征，CRA模块对齐历史缓冲数据与当前输入数据的特征。利用HSIC设计特征映射和配对模块。

Result: 实验证明该框架在医学图像分割任务中有效缓解了领域偏移下的灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: 提出的双对齐策略显著提升了持续学习性能，尤其在处理复杂依赖关系时表现优异。

Abstract: Continual learning in medical image segmentation involves sequential data
acquisition across diverse domains (e.g., clinical sites), where task
interference between past and current domains often leads to catastrophic
forgetting. Existing continual learning methods fail to capture the complex
dependencies between tasks. We introduce a novel framework that mitigates
forgetting by establishing and enhancing complex dependencies between
historical data and the network in the present task. Our framework features a
dual-alignment strategy, the cross-network alignment (CNA) module aligns the
features extracted from the bottleneck layers of the current and previous
networks, respectively, while the cross-representation alignment (CRA) module
aligns the features learned by the current network from historical buffered
data and current input data, respectively. Implementing both types of alignment
is a non-trivial task. To address this, we further analyze the linear and
nonlinear forms of the well-established Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion
(HSIC) and deliberately design feature mapping and feature pairing blocks
within the CRA module. Experiments on medical image segmentation task
demonstrate our framework's effectiveness in mitigating catastrophic forgetting
under domain shifts.

*Christophe Lohou,Bruno Miguel*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用填充撕裂表面的方法分离主动脉夹层中的真假腔，为诊断提供视觉辅助。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主动脉夹层是一种严重疾病，需要紧急处理。通过分离真假腔，可以更好地辅助医生诊断。

Method: 使用数学形态学操作和Aktouf等人的闭合算法生成填充撕裂的3D表面，并利用这些表面切断腔之间的连接。

Result: 成功分离了真假腔，并首次将填充表面用作图像处理操作，为主动脉夹层提供了新的可视化工具。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅有助于诊断，还可能提升其他研究（如配准、分割和血流动力学分析）。

Abstract: Aortic dissection is a serious pathology and requires an emergency
management. It is characterized by one or more tears of the intimal wall of the
normal blood duct of the aorta (true lumen); the blood under pressure then
creates a second blood lumen (false lumen) in the media tissue. The two lumens
are separated by an intimal wall, called flap. From the segmentation of
connected lumens (more precisely, blood inside lumens) of an aortic dissection
3D Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) image, our previous studies allow us
to retrieve the intimal flap by using Mathematical Morphology operators, and
characterize intimal tears by 3d thin surfaces that fill them, these surfaces
are obtained by operating the Aktouf et al. closing algorithm proposed in the
framework of Digital Topology. Indeed, intimal tears are 3D holes in the
intimal flap; although it is impossible to directly segment such non-concrete
data, it is nevertheless possible to "materialize" them with these 3D filling
surfaces that may be quantified or make easier the visualization of these
holes.
  In this paper, we use these surfaces that fill tears to cut connections
between lumens in order to separate them.
  This is the first time that surfaces filling tears are used as an image
processing operator (to disconnect several parts of a 3D object). This lumen
separation allows us to provide one of the first cartographies of an aortic
dissection, that may better visually assist physicians during their diagnosis.
  Our method is able to disconnect lumens, that may also lead to enhance
several current investigations (registration, segmentation, hemodynamics).

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于目标运动的傅里叶叠层成像新方法，避免了传统方法中改变照明角度或相机位置的复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统傅里叶叠层成像方法需要改变照明角度或相机位置，增加了成本和复杂性。

Method: 通过目标运动生成测量多样性，并引入基于学习的方法从双平面强度测量估计k空间坐标。

Result: 在仿真和桌面光学系统中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 新方法简化了傅里叶叠层成像的测量过程，同时保持了高分辨率成像能力。

Abstract: Fourier ptychography (FP) is a powerful light-based synthetic aperture
imaging technique that allows one to reconstruct a high-resolution, wide
field-of-view image by computationally integrating a diverse collection of
low-resolution, far-field measurements. Typically, FP measurement diversity is
introduced by changing the angle of the illumination or the position of the
camera; either approach results in sampling different portions of the target's
spatial frequency content, but both approaches introduce substantial costs and
complexity to the acquisition process. In this work, we introduce Inverse
Synthetic Aperture Fourier Ptychography, a novel approach to FP that foregoes
changing the illumination angle or camera position and instead generates
measurement diversity through target motion. Critically, we also introduce a
novel learning-based method for estimating k-space coordinates from dual plane
intensity measurements, thereby enabling synthetic aperture imaging without
knowing the rotation of the target. We experimentally validate our method in
simulation and on a tabletop optical system.

TL;DR: PLUS是一种即插即用框架，用于增强非对比CT（NCCT）图像上的肝脏病灶分析，显著提高了良恶性病灶的区分能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D分割方法在区分良恶性肝脏病灶时存在局限性，且依赖专业成像模态，而NCCT在常规腹部成像中更普遍。

Method: 提出PLUS框架，通过增强现有3D分割模型，优化NCCT图像上的病灶分析。

Result: 在8,651名患者的实验中，PLUS显著提升了病灶级别的F1分数（5.66%）和患者级别的恶性（6.26%）与良性（4.03%）F1分数。

Conclusion: PLUS展示了利用广泛可用的NCCT成像显著改善恶性肝脏病灶筛查的潜力。

Abstract: Focal liver lesions (FLL) are common clinical findings during physical
examination. Early diagnosis and intervention of liver malignancies are crucial
to improving patient survival. Although the current 3D segmentation paradigm
can accurately detect lesions, it faces limitations in distinguishing between
malignant and benign liver lesions, primarily due to its inability to
differentiate subtle variations between different lesions. Furthermore,
existing methods predominantly rely on specialized imaging modalities such as
multi-phase contrast-enhanced CT and magnetic resonance imaging, whereas
non-contrast CT (NCCT) is more prevalent in routine abdominal imaging. To
address these limitations, we propose PLUS, a plug-and-play framework that
enhances FLL analysis on NCCT images for arbitrary 3D segmentation models. In
extensive experiments involving 8,651 patients, PLUS demonstrated a significant
improvement with existing methods, improving the lesion-level F1 score by
5.66%, the malignant patient-level F1 score by 6.26%, and the benign
patient-level F1 score by 4.03%. Our results demonstrate the potential of PLUS
to improve malignant FLL screening using widely available NCCT imaging
substantially.

TL;DR: EdgeSRIE是一种轻量级混合深度学习框架，用于便携式超声成像中的实时斑点抑制和图像增强，具有低计算成本和高效性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声图像中的斑点模式会掩盖解剖细节，导致诊断不确定性。现有的深度学习方法计算成本高，难以在资源有限的便携设备上应用。

Method: EdgeSRIE包含两个分支：无监督去斑点分支和去模糊分支，通过量化网络并在低功耗SoC上部署实现实时处理。

Result: 在性能评估中，EdgeSRIE在CNR和AGM指标上优于其他基线方法，并实现60帧/秒的实时推理。

Conclusion: EdgeSRIE在资源有限的环境中实现了高质量、实时的超声成像，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Speckle patterns in ultrasound images often obscure anatomical details,
leading to diagnostic uncertainty. Recently, various deep learning (DL)-based
techniques have been introduced to effectively suppress speckle; however, their
high computational costs pose challenges for low-resource devices, such as
portable ultrasound systems. To address this issue, EdgeSRIE, which is a
lightweight hybrid DL framework for real-time speckle reduction and image
enhancement in portable ultrasound imaging, is introduced. The proposed
framework consists of two main branches: an unsupervised despeckling branch,
which is trained by minimizing a loss function between speckled images, and a
deblurring branch, which restores blurred images to sharp images. For hardware
implementation, the trained network is quantized to 8-bit integer precision and
deployed on a low-resource system-on-chip (SoC) with limited power consumption.
In the performance evaluation with phantom and in vivo analyses, EdgeSRIE
achieved the highest contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and average gradient
magnitude (AGM) compared with the other baselines (different 2-rule-based
methods and other 4-DL-based methods). Furthermore, EdgeSRIE enabled real-time
inference at over 60 frames per second while satisfying computational
requirements (< 20K parameters) on actual portable ultrasound hardware. These
results demonstrated the feasibility of EdgeSRIE for real-time, high-quality
ultrasound imaging in resource-limited environments.

Result: 在U-Net、FCN等架构中替换标准卷积为SSL卷积后性能一致提升，集成到nnUNet框架时在多个指标上达到SOTA。

Conclusion: PASC Net通过结合SSL和HTC模块，有效解决了血管分割中的拓扑和低对比度问题，实现了高性能的血管分割。

Abstract: Accurate vessel segmentation is crucial to assist in clinical diagnosis by
medical experts. However,
  the intricate tree-like tubular structure of blood vessels poses significant
challenges for existing
  segmentation algorithms. Small vascular branches are often overlooked due to
their low contrast
  compared to surrounding tissues, leading to incomplete vessel segmentation.
Furthermore, the
  complex vascular topology prevents the model from accurately capturing and
reconstructing vascular
  structure, resulting in incorrect topology, such as breakpoints at the
bifurcation of the vascular tree.
  To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel vessel segmentation
framework called PASC Net. It includes two key modules: a plug-and-play shape
self-learning convolutional (SSL) module
  that optimizes convolution kernel design, and a hierarchical topological
constraint (HTC) module
  that ensures vascular connectivity through topological constraints.
Specifically, the SSL module
  enhances adaptability to vascular structures by optimizing conventional
convolutions into learnable
  strip convolutions, which improves the network's ability to perceive
fine-grained features of tubular
  anatomies. Furthermore, to better preserve the coherence and integrity of
vascular topology, the HTC
  module incorporates hierarchical topological constraints-spanning linear,
planar, and volumetric
  levels-which serve to regularize the network's representation of vascular
continuity and structural
  consistency. We replaced the standard convolutional layers in U-Net, FCN,
U-Mamba, and nnUNet
  with SSL convolutions, leading to consistent performance improvements across
all architectures.
  Furthermore, when integrated into the nnUNet framework, our method
outperformed other methods
  on multiple metrics, achieving state-of-the-art vascular segmentation
performance.

*Xiaochen Wei,Weiwei Guo,Zenghui Zhang,Wenxian Yu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的网格化多模态配准框架（Grid-Reg），用于解决机载SAR与星载光学图像配准的挑战，包括域鲁棒描述符提取网络（HSCMLNet）和网格化求解器（Grid-Solver）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机载SAR与星载光学图像的配准对SAR图像解译和地理定位至关重要，但由于几何和辐射差异大，现有方法难以处理。

Method: 提出Grid-Reg框架，基于无检测器和全局匹配损失，通过HSCMLNet提取特征，Grid-Solver优化变换参数。

Result: 在真实数据集上验证，Grid-Reg优于现有技术。

Conclusion: Grid-Reg通过全局匹配和域鲁棒特征提取，显著提升了跨平台异构图像配准性能。

Abstract: Registering airborne SAR with spaceborne optical images is crucial for SAR
image interpretation and geo-localization. It is challenging for this
cross-platform heterogeneous image registration due to significant geometric
and radiation differences, which current methods fail to handle. To tackle
these challenges, we propose a novel grid-based multimodal registration
framework (Grid-Reg) across airborne and space-born platforms, including a new
domain-robust descriptor extraction network, Hybrid Siamese Correlation Metric
Learning Network (HSCMLNet) and a grid-based solver (Grid-solver) for
transformation parameters estimation. Our Grid-Reg is based on detector-free
and global matching loss rather than accurate keypoint correspondences. These
accurate correspondences are inherently difficult in heterogeneous images with
large geometric deformation. By Grid-Solver, our Grid-Reg estimates
transformation parameters by optimizing robust global matching loss-based patch
correspondences of whole images in a coarse-to-fine strategy. To robustly
calculate the similarity between patches, specifically that have noise and
change objects, we propose HSCMLNet, including a hybrid Siamese module to
extract high-level features of multimodal images and a correlation learning
module (CMLModule) based equiangular unit basis vectors (EUBVs). Moreover, we
propose a manifold loss EUBVsLoss to constrain the normalized correlation
between local embeddings of patches and EUBVs. Furthermore, we curate a new
challenging benchmark dataset of SAR-to-optical registration using real-world
UAV MiniSAR data and optical images from Google Earth. We extensively analyze
factors affecting registration accuracy and compare our method with
state-of-the-art techniques on this dataset, showing superior performance.

a new data quality control pipeline to refine the quality of CT images based on
GAN and sliding windows. Also, we use class-sensitive cost functions including
Label Distribution Aware Loss(LDAM Loss) and Class-balanced(CB) Loss to solve
the long-tail problem existing in datasets. Our model reaches more than 0.983

Result: 在EndoVis2018和EndoVis2017数据集上分别达到0.80和0.54的mIoU。

Conclusion: Surg-SegFormer通过自动化手术场景理解，有效支持外科培训，提升学员独立学习能力。

Abstract: Holistic surgical scene segmentation in robot-assisted surgery (RAS) enables
surgical residents to identify various anatomical tissues, articulated tools,
and critical structures, such as veins and vessels. Given the firm
intraoperative time constraints, it is challenging for surgeons to provide
detailed real-time explanations of the operative field for trainees. This
challenge is compounded by the scarcity of expert surgeons relative to
trainees, making the unambiguous delineation of go- and no-go zones
inconvenient. Therefore, high-performance semantic segmentation models offer a
solution by providing clear postoperative analyses of surgical procedures.
However, recent advanced segmentation models rely on user-generated prompts,
rendering them impractical for lengthy surgical videos that commonly exceed an
hour. To address this challenge, we introduce Surg-SegFormer, a novel
prompt-free model that outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques.
Surg-SegFormer attained a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.80 on the
EndoVis2018 dataset and 0.54 on the EndoVis2017 dataset. By providing robust
and automated surgical scene comprehension, this model significantly reduces
the tutoring burden on expert surgeons, empowering residents to independently
and effectively understand complex surgical environments.

Abstract: Understanding surgical scenes can provide better healthcare quality for
patients, especially with the vast amount of video data that is generated
during MIS. Processing these videos generates valuable assets for training
sophisticated models. In this paper, we introduce CLIP-RL, a novel contrastive
language-image pre-training model tailored for semantic segmentation for
surgical scenes. CLIP-RL presents a new segmentation approach which involves
reinforcement learning and curriculum learning, enabling continuous refinement
of the segmentation masks during the full training pipeline. Our model has
shown robust performance in different optical settings, such as occlusions,
texture variations, and dynamic lighting, presenting significant challenges.
CLIP model serves as a powerful feature extractor, capturing rich semantic
context that enhances the distinction between instruments and tissues. The RL
module plays a pivotal role in dynamically refining predictions through
iterative action-space adjustments. We evaluated CLIP-RL on the EndoVis 2018
and EndoVis 2017 datasets. CLIP-RL achieved a mean IoU of 81%, outperforming
state-of-the-art models, and a mean IoU of 74.12% on EndoVis 2017. This
superior performance was achieved due to the combination of contrastive
learning with reinforcement learning and curriculum learning.

Abstract: Ovarian tumor, as a common gynecological disease, can rapidly deteriorate
into serious health crises when undetected early, thus posing significant
threats to the health of women. Deep neural networks have the potential to
identify ovarian tumors, thereby reducing mortality rates, but limited public
datasets hinder its progress. To address this gap, we introduce a vital ovarian
tumor pathological recognition dataset called \textbf{ViTaL} that contains
\textbf{V}isual, \textbf{T}abular and \textbf{L}inguistic modality data of 496
patients across six pathological categories. The ViTaL dataset comprises three
subsets corresponding to different patient data modalities: visual data from
2216 two-dimensional ultrasound images, tabular data from medical examinations
of 496 patients, and linguistic data from ultrasound reports of 496 patients.
It is insufficient to merely distinguish between benign and malignant ovarian
tumors in clinical practice. To enable multi-pathology classification of
ovarian tumor, we propose a ViTaL-Net based on the Triplet Hierarchical Offset
Attention Mechanism (THOAM) to minimize the loss incurred during feature fusion
of multi-modal data. This mechanism could effectively enhance the relevance and
complementarity between information from different modalities. ViTaL-Net serves
as a benchmark for the task of multi-pathology, multi-modality classification
of ovarian tumors. In our comprehensive experiments, the proposed method
exhibited satisfactory performance, achieving accuracies exceeding 90\% on the
two most common pathological types of ovarian tumor and an overall performance
of 85\%. Our dataset and code are available at

Abstract: Multi-source data classification is a critical yet challenging task for
remote sensing image interpretation. Existing methods lack adaptability to
diverse land cover types when modeling frequency domain features. To this end,
we propose a Dynamic Frequency Feature Fusion Network (DFFNet) for
hyperspectral image (HSI) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) / Light Detection
and Ranging (LiDAR) data joint classification. Specifically, we design a
dynamic filter block to dynamically learn the filter kernels in the frequency
domain by aggregating the input features. The frequency contextual knowledge is
injected into frequency filter kernels. Additionally, we propose
spectral-spatial adaptive fusion block for cross-modal feature fusion. It
enhances the spectral and spatial attention weight interactions via channel
shuffle operation, thereby providing comprehensive cross-modal feature fusion.
Experiments on two benchmark datasets show that our DFFNet outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in multi-source data classification. The codes will be
made publicly available at https://github.com/oucailab/DFFNet.

Conclusion: FB-Diff为4D医学影像的时间插值提供了一种更准确的生成方法。

Abstract: The temporal interpolation task for 4D medical imaging, plays a crucial role
in clinical practice of respiratory motion modeling. Following the simplified
linear-motion hypothesis, existing approaches adopt optical flow-based models
to interpolate intermediate frames. However, realistic respiratory motions
should be nonlinear and quasi-periodic with specific frequencies. Intuited by
this property, we resolve the temporal interpolation task from the frequency
perspective, and propose a Fourier basis-guided Diffusion model, termed
FB-Diff. Specifically, due to the regular motion discipline of respiration,
physiological motion priors are introduced to describe general characteristics
of temporal data distributions. Then a Fourier motion operator is elaborately
devised to extract Fourier bases by incorporating physiological motion priors
and case-specific spectral information in the feature space of Variational
Autoencoder. Well-learned Fourier bases can better simulate respiratory motions
with motion patterns of specific frequencies. Conditioned on starting and
ending frames, the diffusion model further leverages well-learned Fourier bases
via the basis interaction operator, which promotes the temporal interpolation
task in a generative manner. Extensive results demonstrate that FB-Diff
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) perceptual performance with better temporal
consistency while maintaining promising reconstruction metrics. Codes are
available.

Conclusion: DDU为DSSI中的展开方法提供了坚实基础，未来可进一步扩展。

Abstract: Snapshot hyperspectral imaging systems acquire spectral data cubes through
compressed sensing. Recently, diffractive snapshot spectral imaging (DSSI)
methods have attracted significant attention. While various optical designs and
improvements continue to emerge, research on reconstruction algorithms remains
limited. Although numerous networks and deep unfolding methods have been
applied on similar tasks, they are not fully compatible with DSSI systems
because of their distinct optical encoding mechanism. In this paper, we propose
an efficient deep unfolding framework for diffractive systems, termed
diffractive deep unfolding (DDU). Specifically, we derive an analytical
solution for the data fidelity term in DSSI, ensuring both the efficiency and
the effectiveness during the iterative reconstruction process. Given the
severely ill-posed nature of the problem, we employ a network-based
initialization strategy rather than non-learning-based methods or linear
layers, leading to enhanced stability and performance. Our framework
demonstrates strong compatibility with existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models,
which effectively address the initialization and prior subproblem. Extensive
experiments validate the superiority of the proposed DDU framework, showcasing
improved performance while maintaining comparable parameter counts and
computational complexity. These results suggest that DDU provides a solid
foundation for future unfolding-based methods in DSSI.

Abstract: Medical AI diagnosis including histopathology segmentation has derived
benefits from the recent development of deep learning technology. However, deep
learning itself requires a large amount of training data and the medical image
segmentation masking, in particular, requires an extremely high cost due to the
shortage of medical specialists. To mitigate this issue, we propose a new data
augmentation method built upon the conventional Copy and Paste (CP)
augmentation technique, called CP-Dilatation, and apply it to histopathology
image segmentation. To the well-known traditional CP technique, the proposed
method adds a dilation operation that can preserve the boundary context
information of the malignancy, which is important in histopathological image
diagnosis, as the boundary between the malignancy and its margin is mostly
unclear and a significant context exists in the margin. In our experiments
using histopathology benchmark datasets, the proposed method was found superior
to the other state-of-the-art baselines chosen for comparison.

Abstract: Biplanar X-ray imaging is widely used in health screening, postoperative
rehabilitation evaluation of orthopedic diseases, and injury surgery due to its
rapid acquisition, low radiation dose, and straightforward setup. However, 3D
volume reconstruction from only two orthogonal projections represents a
profoundly ill-posed inverse problem, owing to the intrinsic lack of depth
information and irreducible ambiguities in soft-tissue visualization. Some
existing methods can reconstruct skeletal structures and Computed Tomography
(CT) volumes, they often yield incomplete bone geometry, imprecise tissue
boundaries, and a lack of anatomical realism, thereby limiting their clinical
utility in scenarios such as surgical planning and postoperative assessment. In
this study, we introduce SPIDER, a novel supervised framework designed to
reconstruct CT volumes from biplanar X-ray images. SPIDER incorporates tissue
structure as prior (e.g., anatomical segmentation) into an implicit neural
representation decoder in the form of joint supervision through a unified
encoder-decoder architecture. This design enables the model to jointly learn
image intensities and anatomical structures in a pixel-aligned fashion. To
address the challenges posed by sparse input and structural ambiguity, SPIDER
directly embeds anatomical constraints into the reconstruction process, thereby
enhancing structural continuity and reducing soft-tissue artifacts. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on clinical head CT datasets and show that SPIDER
generates anatomically accurate reconstructions from only two projections.
Furthermore, our approach demonstrates strong potential in downstream
segmentation tasks, underscoring its utility in personalized treatment planning
and image-guided surgical navigation.

Abstract: Synthetic images are an option for augmenting limited medical imaging
datasets to improve the performance of various machine learning models. A
common metric for evaluating synthetic image quality is the Fr\'echet Inception
Distance (FID) which measures the similarity of two image datasets. In this
study we evaluate the relationship between this metric and the improvement
which synthetic images, generated by a Progressively Growing Generative
Adversarial Network (PGGAN), grant when augmenting Diabetes-related Macular
Edema (DME) intraretinal fluid segmentation performed by a U-Net model with
limited amounts of training data. We find that the behaviour of augmenting with
standard and synthetic images agrees with previously conducted experiments.
Additionally, we show that dissimilar (high FID) datasets do not improve
segmentation significantly. As FID between the training and augmenting datasets
decreases, the augmentation datasets are shown to contribute to significant and
robust improvements in image segmentation. Finally, we find that there is
significant evidence to suggest that synthetic and standard augmentations
follow separate log-normal trends between FID and improvements in model
performance, with synthetic data proving more effective than standard
augmentation techniques. Our findings show that more similar datasets (lower
FID) will be more effective at improving U-Net performance, however, the
results also suggest that this improvement may only occur when images are
sufficiently dissimilar.

Abstract: Brain tumor resection is a complex procedure with significant implications
for patient survival and quality of life. Predictions of patient outcomes
provide clinicians and patients the opportunity to select the most suitable
onco-functional balance. In this study, global features derived from structural
magnetic resonance imaging in a clinical dataset of 49 pre- and post-surgery
patients identified potential biomarkers associated with survival outcomes. We
propose a framework that integrates Explainable AI (XAI) with
neuroimaging-based feature engineering for survival assessment, offering
guidance for surgical decision-making. In this study, we introduce a global
explanation optimizer that refines survival-related feature attribution in deep
learning models, enhancing interpretability and reliability. Our findings
suggest that survival is influenced by alterations in regions associated with
cognitive and sensory functions, indicating the importance of preserving areas
involved in decision-making and emotional regulation during surgery to improve
outcomes. The global explanation optimizer improves both fidelity and
comprehensibility of explanations compared to state-of-the-art XAI methods. It
effectively identifies survival-related variability, underscoring its relevance
in precision medicine for brain tumor treatment.

Conclusion: MurreNet通过解耦和优化多模态特征，显著提升了癌症生存预测的准确性。

Abstract: Cancer survival prediction requires integrating pathological Whole Slide
Images (WSIs) and genomic profiles, a challenging task due to the inherent
heterogeneity and the complexity of modeling both inter- and intra-modality
interactions. Current methods often employ straightforward fusion strategies
for multimodal feature integration, failing to comprehensively capture
modality-specific and modality-common interactions, resulting in a limited
understanding of multimodal correlations and suboptimal predictive performance.
To mitigate these limitations, this paper presents a Multimodal Representation
Decoupling Network (MurreNet) to advance cancer survival analysis.
Specifically, we first propose a Multimodal Representation Decomposition (MRD)
module to explicitly decompose paired input data into modality-specific and
modality-shared representations, thereby reducing redundancy between
modalities. Furthermore, the disentangled representations are further refined
then updated through a novel training regularization strategy that imposes
constraints on distributional similarity, difference, and representativeness of

into a joint representation via proposed Deep Holistic Orthogonal Fusion (DHOF)

TL;DR: SASHA是一种基于深度强化学习的方法，用于高效分析组织病理学图像，通过智能采样和选择性放大，显著降低计算和内存成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全切片图像（WSI）尺寸巨大，高分辨率分析计算不可行，且诊断标签通常仅在切片级别可用，精细标注成本高。

Method: SASHA结合轻量级分层注意力多实例学习（MIL）模型学习特征，并通过强化学习智能采样和放大高分辨率区域。

Result: SASHA在计算和内存成本显著降低的情况下，性能与全高分辨率分析方法相当，优于稀疏采样方法。

Conclusion: SASHA为医学影像自动化诊断提供了一种高效解决方案，尤其适用于大尺寸且信息稀疏的图像。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are increasingly applied for automated histopathology.
Yet, whole-slide images (WSIs) are often acquired at gigapixel sizes, rendering
it computationally infeasible to analyze them entirely at high resolution.
Diagnostic labels are largely available only at the slide-level, because expert
annotation of images at a finer (patch) level is both laborious and expensive.
Moreover, regions with diagnostic information typically occupy only a small
fraction of the WSI, making it inefficient to examine the entire slide at full
resolution. Here, we propose SASHA -- {\it S}equential {\it A}ttention-based
{\it S}ampling for {\it H}istopathological {\it A}nalysis -- a deep
reinforcement learning approach for efficient analysis of histopathological
images. First, SASHA learns informative features with a lightweight
hierarchical, attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) model. Second,
SASHA samples intelligently and zooms selectively into a small fraction
(10-20\%) of high-resolution patches, to achieve reliable diagnosis. We show
that SASHA matches state-of-the-art methods that analyze the WSI fully at
high-resolution, albeit at a fraction of their computational and memory costs.
In addition, it significantly outperforms competing, sparse sampling methods.
We propose SASHA as an intelligent sampling model for medical imaging
challenges that involve automated diagnosis with exceptionally large images
containing sparsely informative features.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散变换器的单视角X射线图像合成多视角图像的新方法，解决了传统方法在角度范围、分辨率和图像质量上的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多视角X射线成像虽然能提供互补信息，但会增加辐射暴露并复杂化临床流程，因此需要一种从单视角合成多视角图像的方法。

Method: 采用扩散变换器（Diffusion Transformer）和弱到强的训练策略，以保持细节并稳定生成高分辨率图像。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能生成更高分辨率的图像，并更好地控制视角角度。

Conclusion: 该方法对临床应用、医学教育和数据扩展具有重要意义，能够生成高质量的多视角数据集。

Abstract: X-ray imaging is a rapid and cost-effective tool for visualizing internal
human anatomy. While multi-view X-ray imaging provides complementary
information that enhances diagnosis, intervention, and education, acquiring
images from multiple angles increases radiation exposure and complicates
clinical workflows. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
view-conditioned diffusion model for synthesizing multi-view X-ray images from
a single view. Unlike prior methods, which are limited in angular range,
resolution, and image quality, our approach leverages the Diffusion Transformer
to preserve fine details and employs a weak-to-strong training strategy for
stable high-resolution image generation. Experimental results demonstrate that
our method generates higher-resolution outputs with improved control over
viewing angles. This capability has significant implications not only for
clinical applications but also for medical education and data extension,
enabling the creation of diverse, high-quality datasets for training and
analysis. Our code is available at GitHub.

Abstract: The identification of cardiac phase is an essential step for analysis and
diagnosis of cardiac function. Automatic methods, especially data-driven
methods for cardiac phase detection, typically require extensive annotations,
which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this paper, we present an
unsupervised framework for end-diastole (ED) and end-systole (ES) detection
through self-supervised learning of latent cardiac motion trajectories from
4-chamber-view echocardiography videos. Our method eliminates the need for
manual annotations, including ED and ES indices, segmentation, or volumetric
measurements, by training a reconstruction model to encode interpretable
spatiotemporal motion patterns. Evaluated on the EchoNet-Dynamic benchmark, the
approach achieves mean absolute error (MAE) of 3 frames (58.3 ms) for ED and 2
frames (38.8 ms) for ES detection, matching state-of-the-art supervised
methods. Extended to fetal echocardiography, the model demonstrates robust
performance with MAE 1.46 frames (20.7 ms) for ED and 1.74 frames (25.3 ms) for
ES, despite the fact that the fetal heart model is built using non-standardized
heart views due to fetal heart positioning variability. Our results demonstrate
the potential of the proposed latent motion trajectory strategy for cardiac
phase detection in adult and fetal echocardiography. This work advances
unsupervised cardiac motion analysis, offering a scalable solution for clinical
populations lacking annotated data. Code will be released at

Motivation: 由于腕骨结构复杂且RA疾病进展导致标注困难，现有CAD研究受限，因此需要高质量数据集支持相关研究。

Method: 构建包含621张腕骨CR图像的多任务数据集，提供像素级实例分割标注和SvdH骨侵蚀评分。

Result: 数据集包含443张图像的实例分割标注和548张图像的SvdH评分，支持RA相关研究任务。

Conclusion: 该数据集有望促进RA领域的CAD研究，并扩展至其他腕骨相关任务。

Abstract: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common autoimmune disease that has been the
focus of research in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) and disease monitoring. In
clinical settings, conventional radiography (CR) is widely used for the
screening and evaluation of RA due to its low cost and accessibility. The wrist
is a critical region for the diagnosis of RA. However, CAD research in this
area remains limited, primarily due to the challenges in acquiring high-quality
instance-level annotations. (i) The wrist comprises numerous small bones with
narrow joint spaces, complex structures, and frequent overlaps, requiring
detailed anatomical knowledge for accurate annotation. (ii) Disease progression
in RA often leads to osteophyte, bone erosion (BE), and even bony ankylosis,
which alter bone morphology and increase annotation difficulty, necessitating
expertise in rheumatology. This work presents a multi-task dataset for wrist
bone in CR, including two tasks: (i) wrist bone instance segmentation and (ii)
Sharp/van der Heijde (SvdH) BE scoring, which is the first public resource for
wrist bone instance segmentation. This dataset comprises 621 wrist conventional
radiographs of 227 patients from four medical centers, with pixel-level
instance segmentation annotations for 443 images and SvdH BE scores for 548
images. This dataset can potentially support a wide range of research tasks
related to RA, including joint space narrowing (JSN) progression
quantification, BE detection, bone deformity evaluation, and osteophyte
detection. It may also be applied to other wrist-related tasks, such as carpal
bone fracture localization. We hope this dataset will significantly lower the
barrier to research on wrist RA and accelerate progress in CAD research within
the RA-related domain.

Conclusion: MoDA通过创新方法有效解决了现有挑战，为说话头生成提供了高效且真实的解决方案。

Abstract: Talking head generation with arbitrary identities and speech audio remains a
crucial problem in the realm of digital humans and the virtual metaverse.
Recently, diffusion models have become a popular generative technique in this
field with their strong generation and generalization capabilities. However,
several challenges remain for diffusion-based methods: 1) inefficient inference
and visual artifacts, which arise from the implicit latent space of Variational
Auto-Encoders (VAE), complicating the diffusion process; 2) authentic facial
expressions and head movements, resulting from insufficient multi-modal
information interaction. In this paper, MoDA handle these challenges by 1)
defines a joint parameter space to bridge motion generation and neural
rendering, and leverages flow matching to simplify the diffusion learning
process; 2) introduces a multi-modal diffusion architecture to model the
interaction among noisy motion, audio, and auxiliary conditions, ultimately
enhancing overall facial expressiveness. Subsequently, a coarse-to-fine fusion
strategy is adopted to progressively integrate different modalities, ensuring
effective integration across feature spaces. Experimental results demonstrate
that MoDA significantly improves video diversity, realism, and efficiency,
making it suitable for real-world applications.

Motivation: 解决3D网格局部编辑中需要用户输入（如涂鸦或边界框）的问题，实现自动化且精确的编辑。

Method: 提出一种改进的分数蒸馏采样技术（localization-modulated image guidance），结合预测的定位掩码和参考图像，实现全局和局部的精确编辑。

Result: 在多种网格和图像上验证了方法的有效性，实现了无需用户输入的准确局部编辑。

Conclusion: 3D PixBrush为3D网格的自动化局部编辑提供了一种高效且精确的解决方案。

Abstract: We present 3D PixBrush, a method for performing image-driven edits of local
regions on 3D meshes. 3D PixBrush predicts a localization mask and a
synthesized texture that faithfully portray the object in the reference image.
Our predicted localizations are both globally coherent and locally precise.
Globally - our method contextualizes the object in the reference image and
automatically positions it onto the input mesh. Locally - our method produces
masks that conform to the geometry of the reference image. Notably, our method
does not require any user input (in the form of scribbles or bounding boxes) to
achieve accurate localizations. Instead, our method predicts a localization
mask on the 3D mesh from scratch. To achieve this, we propose a modification to
the score distillation sampling technique which incorporates both the predicted
localization and the reference image, referred to as localization-modulated
image guidance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed technique on a
wide variety of meshes and images.

Motivation: 时间变化体积数据的交互式可视化因复杂的时空特征和大规模数据集而具有挑战性，现有方法训练时间长。

Method: 采用基于特征的多分辨率Tesseract编码架构（F-Hash），结合多级无碰撞哈希函数和动态4D多分辨率嵌入网格，实现高效编码。

Result: F-Hash在多种时间变化体积数据集上实现了最先进的收敛速度，并优化了渲染性能。

Conclusion: F-Hash为时间变化特征跟踪和演化可视化提供了一种统一的编码解决方案，显著提升了效率和性能。

Abstract: Interactive time-varying volume visualization is challenging due to its
complex spatiotemporal features and sheer size of the dataset. Recent works
transform the original discrete time-varying volumetric data into continuous
Implicit Neural Representations (INR) to address the issues of compression,
rendering, and super-resolution in both spatial and temporal domains. However,
training the INR takes a long time to converge, especially when handling
large-scale time-varying volumetric datasets. In this work, we proposed F-Hash,
a novel feature-based multi-resolution Tesseract encoding architecture to
greatly enhance the convergence speed compared with existing input encoding
methods for modeling time-varying volumetric data. The proposed design
incorporates multi-level collision-free hash functions that map dynamic 4D
multi-resolution embedding grids without bucket waste, achieving high encoding
capacity with compact encoding parameters. Our encoding method is agnostic to
time-varying feature detection methods, making it a unified encoding solution
for feature tracking and evolution visualization. Experiments show the F-Hash
achieves state-of-the-art convergence speed in training various time-varying
volumetric datasets for diverse features. We also proposed an adaptive ray
marching algorithm to optimize the sample streaming for faster rendering of the
time-varying neural representation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型多关注高层编码器的重建任务，忽视了低层局部特征的有效利用，PointAMaLR旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用分层重建策略，低层关注细粒度特征恢复，高层处理粗粒度特征重建，并嵌入局部注意力模块增强语义理解。

Result: 在ModelNet、ShapeNet等基准数据集上表现出色，在ScanObjectNN和S3DIS等实际数据集上也有竞争力。

Conclusion: PointAMaLR在多尺度语义理解和实际应用中均表现出高效性和实用性。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has emerged as a prominent research direction in
point cloud processing. While existing models predominantly concentrate on
reconstruction tasks at higher encoder layers, they often neglect the effective
utilization of low-level local features, which are typically employed solely
for activation computations rather than directly contributing to reconstruction
tasks. To overcome this limitation, we introduce PointAMaLR, a novel
self-supervised learning framework that enhances feature representation and
processing accuracy through attention-guided multi-scale local reconstruction.
PointAMaLR implements hierarchical reconstruction across multiple local
regions, with lower layers focusing on fine-scale feature restoration while
upper layers address coarse-scale feature reconstruction, thereby enabling
complex inter-patch interactions. Furthermore, to augment feature
representation capabilities, we incorporate a Local Attention (LA) module in
the embedding layer to enhance semantic feature understanding. Comprehensive
experiments on benchmark datasets ModelNet and ShapeNet demonstrate
PointAMaLR's superior accuracy and quality in both classification and
reconstruction tasks. Moreover, when evaluated on the real-world dataset
ScanObjectNN and the 3D large scene segmentation dataset S3DIS, our model
achieves highly competitive performance metrics. These results not only
validate PointAMaLR's effectiveness in multi-scale semantic understanding but
also underscore its practical applicability in real-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虚拟现实（VR）中图像渲染的高计算需求导致实时渲染延迟，影响用户体验。虽然注视点渲染能减少计算负担，但注视跟踪过程本身的计算开销可能抵消其优势。

Result: 实验表明，A3FR能将端到端渲染延迟降低至多2倍，同时保持视觉质量。

Conclusion: A3FR通过优化注视点渲染流程，有效解决了实时渲染延迟问题，为VR应用提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Virtual reality (VR) significantly transforms immersive digital interfaces,
greatly enhancing education, professional practices, and entertainment by
increasing user engagement and opening up new possibilities in various
industries. Among its numerous applications, image rendering is crucial.
Nevertheless, rendering methodologies like 3D Gaussian Splatting impose high
computational demands, driven predominantly by user expectations for superior
visual quality. This results in notable processing delays for real-time image
rendering, which greatly affects the user experience. Additionally, VR devices
such as head-mounted displays (HMDs) are intricately linked to human visual
behavior, leveraging knowledge from perception and cognition to improve user
experience. These insights have spurred the development of foveated rendering,
a technique that dynamically adjusts rendering resolution based on the user's
gaze direction. The resultant solution, known as gaze-tracked foveated
rendering, significantly reduces the computational burden of the rendering
process.
  Although gaze-tracked foveated rendering can reduce rendering costs, the
computational overhead of the gaze tracking process itself can sometimes
outweigh the rendering savings, leading to increased processing latency. To
address this issue, we propose an efficient rendering framework
called~\textit{A3FR}, designed to minimize the latency of gaze-tracked foveated
rendering via the parallelization of gaze tracking and foveated rendering
processes. For the rendering algorithm, we utilize 3D Gaussian Splatting, a
state-of-the-art neural rendering technique. Evaluation results demonstrate
that A3FR can reduce end-to-end rendering latency by up to $2\times$ while
maintaining visual quality.

Abstract: Real-time hair simulation is a vital component in creating believable virtual
avatars, as it provides a sense of immersion and authenticity. The dynamic
behavior of hair, such as bouncing or swaying in response to character
movements like jumping or walking, plays a significant role in enhancing the
overall realism and engagement of virtual experiences. Current methods for
simulating hair have been constrained by two primary approaches: highly
optimized physics-based systems and neural methods. However, state-of-the-art
neural techniques have been limited to quasi-static solutions, failing to
capture the dynamic behavior of hair. This paper introduces a novel neural
method that breaks through these limitations, achieving efficient and stable
dynamic hair simulation while outperforming existing approaches. We propose a
fully self-supervised method which can be trained without any manual
intervention or artist generated training data allowing the method to be
integrated with hair reconstruction methods to enable automatic end-to-end
methods for avatar reconstruction. Our approach harnesses the power of compact,
memory-efficient neural networks to simulate hair at the strand level, allowing
for the simulation of diverse hairstyles without excessive computational
resources or memory requirements. We validate the effectiveness of our method
through a variety of hairstyle examples, showcasing its potential for
real-world applications.

Abstract: Image logs are crucial in capturing high-quality geological information about
subsurface formations. Among the various geological features that can be
gleaned from Formation Micro Imager log, vugs are essential for reservoir
evaluation. This paper introduces an automated Vug Detection Model, leveraging
advanced computer vision techniques to streamline the vug identification
process. Manual and semiautomated methods are limited by individual bias,
labour-intensity and inflexibility in parameter finetuning. Our methodology
also introduces statistical analysis on vug characteristics. Pre-processing
steps, including logical file extraction and normalization, ensured
standardized and usable data. The sixstep vug identification methodology
encompasses top-k mode extraction, adaptive thresholding, contour
identification, aggregation, advanced filtering, and optional filtering for low
vuggy regions. The model's adaptability is evidenced by its ability to identify
vugs missed by manual picking undertaken by experts. Results demonstrate the
model's accuracy through validation against expert picks. Detailed metrics,
such as count, mean, and standard deviation of vug areas within zones, were
introduced, showcasing the model's capabilities compared to manual picking. The
vug area distribution plot enhances understanding of vug types in the
reservoir. This research focuses on the identification and characterization of
vugs that in turn aids in the better understanding of reservoirs.

Method: 使用MITgcm进行理想化数值模拟，并通过敏感性实验和分析模型（Stommel-Arons模型）验证结果。

Result: 模拟结果支持体积通量驱动假说，表明深层流入是分层环流的主要驱动力，中层流出是动力学结果。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了涡度通量驱动假说，为南海分层环流动力学提供了新见解。

Abstract: The South China Sea (SCS) features a unique layered circulation structure
known as the cyclonic-anticyclonic-cyclonic (CAC) pattern, whose driving
mechanisms remain a subject of debate. This study employs idealized numerical
simulations using the MITgcm to investigate the role of volume flux and
vorticity flux through the Luzon Strait (LS) to the SCS circulation. The
control experiment successfully reproduces the observed "sandwiched" transport
structure at the LS and the CAC circulation within the SCS. Sensitivity
experiments, in which planetary vorticity is set to zero in the Pacific and LS,
reveal that the CAC structure is insensitive to vorticity flux input. By
applying the Stommel-Arons model to Cartesian coordinates, we provide
analytical solutions that align with the simulation results, supporting the
volume flux-driven hypothesis. Our findings suggest that the deep inflow
through the LS is the primary driver of the layered circulation system, while
the middle-layer outflow is a dynamical consequence. These results challenge
the vorticity flux-driven hypothesis and offer new insights into the dynamics
of layered circulations in the SCS.

Abstract: With the advancement of crewed deep-space missions, Bioregenerative Life
Support Systems (BLSS) for lunar bases face stresses from lunar environmental
factors. While microgravity and radiation are well-studied, the low-magnetic
field's effects remain unclear. Earthworms ("soil scavengers") improve lunar
soil simulant and degrade plant waste, as shown in our prior studies. We tested
earthworms in lunar soil simulant mixed with organic waste (from "Lunar Palace
365" experiment) under three magnetic conditions: lunar-low, Earth, and high.
Stronger fields increased earthworm oxidative stress (MDA) and impaired
neurotransmitters. Weaker fields enhanced substrate cultivability: neutralized
pH, increased nutrients, humus, and wheat seedling rate. Microbial analyses
showed: (1) Higher fungal Shannon index under high fields indicated impaired
digestion; (2) More positive correlations in gut networks suggested slower
microbial cooperation (e.g., lignocellulose degradation); (3) Reduced Network
Size, Path Length and Modularity confirmed disrupted interactions. This
disproves lunar low-magnetic stress on earthworm-soil-waste systems, aiding
deep-space BLSS research.

transition, which explains the formation of mountains, the constant and

coastlines of continents and islands, which also depends on the fluidity of
water masses.

TL;DR: 提出了一种将注释作为一等设计元素的声明式扩展，提升了可视化工具的注释表达能力与复用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可视化工具将注释视为次要构造，手动定义、难以复用且与可视化语法松散耦合。

Method: 扩展Wilkinson的图形语法，将注释作为一等设计元素，开发了Vega-Lite Annotation原型。

Result: 与八种现有工具对比，该方法提升了表达力、减少了创作工作量，并支持可移植的注释工作流。

Conclusion: 该方法为可视化注释提供了更高效、灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Annotations are central to effective data communication, yet most
visualization tools treat them as secondary constructs -- manually defined,
difficult to reuse, and loosely coupled to the underlying visualization
grammar. We propose a declarative extension to Wilkinson's Grammar of Graphics
that reifies annotations as first-class design elements, enabling structured
specification of annotation targets, types, and positioning strategies. To
demonstrate the utility of our approach, we develop a prototype extension
called Vega-Lite Annotation. Through comparison with eight existing tools, we
show that our approach enhances expressiveness, reduces authoring effort, and
enables portable, semantically integrated annotation workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 化妆对自我表达和信心至关重要，但现有辅助工具未能满足视障人士在化妆流程中的复杂需求。

Method: 通过15名视障化妆用户的实地调查和5名专业化妆师的访谈，分析化妆行为及反馈需求。

Result: 研究发现视障用户依赖触觉策略，面临混合、对称和评估的挑战，需要实时反馈。

Conclusion: 提出了非视觉化妆的反馈需求分类，并设计未来辅助系统的方向，强调无手操作和情境感知支持。

Abstract: Makeup plays a vital role in self-expression, identity, and confidence - yet
remains an underexplored domain for assistive technology, especially for people
with vision impairments. While existing tools support isolated tasks such as
color identification or product labeling, they rarely address the procedural
complexity of makeup routines: coordinating step sequences, managing product
placement, and assessing the final look with accessible feedback. To understand
the real-world process, we conducted a contextual inquiry with 15 visually
impaired makeup users, capturing real-time makeup application behaviors and
their step-by-step information needs and assessment approaches. Our findings
reveal embodied, tactile-first strategies; persistent challenges in blending,
symmetry, and assessment; and a desire for honest, real-time, goal-aligned
feedback. We also interviewed five professional makeup artists, who reviewed
participant makeup videos and provided expert responses to participant-raised
questions and assessment practices. We contribute a taxonomy of feedback needs
in non-visual makeup, and outline design implications for future assistive
systems - emphasizing hands-free, conversational interaction and context-aware,
procedural support for expressive and independent beauty practices.

TL;DR: 提出并验证了一个四阶段工作流程，用于高精度转录和分析中世纪法律文件，结合HTR模型和LLM技术，显著降低错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决中世纪法律文件转录和分析中的高难度挑战，减少人工劳动，提高准确性和效率。

Method: 1. 使用HTR模型生成基线转录；2. 结合LLM进行多模态后校正；3. 用LLM扩展缩写文本为完整拉丁文；4. 通过LLM进行命名实体校正。

Result: 在详细案例研究中，单词错误率（WER）降至2-7%，显著提高了转录质量和自动化水平。

Conclusion: 该混合多阶段方法有效自动化了转录中最费力的部分，并生成高质量、可分析的结果，适用于当前技术环境。

Abstract: This article presents and validates an ideal, four-stage workflow for the
high-accuracy transcription and analysis of challenging medieval legal
documents. The process begins with a specialized Handwritten Text Recognition
(HTR) model, itself created using a novel "Clean Ground Truth" curation method
where a Large Language Model (LLM) refines the training data. This HTR model
provides a robust baseline transcription (Stage 1). In Stage 2, this baseline
is fed, along with the original document image, to an LLM for multimodal
post-correction, grounding the LLM's analysis and improving accuracy. The
corrected, abbreviated text is then expanded into full, scholarly Latin using a
prompt-guided LLM (Stage 3). A final LLM pass performs Named-Entity Correction
(NEC), regularizing proper nouns and generating plausible alternatives for
ambiguous readings (Stage 4). We validate this workflow through detailed case
studies, achieving Word Error Rates (WER) in the range of 2-7% against
scholarly ground truths. The results demonstrate that this hybrid, multi-stage
approach effectively automates the most laborious aspects of transcription
while producing a high-quality, analyzable output, representing a powerful and
practical solution for the current technological landscape.

Abstract: Circular genome visualizations are essential for exploring structural
variants and gene regulation. However, existing tools often require complex
scripting and manual configuration, making the process time-consuming,
error-prone, and difficult to learn. To address these challenges, we introduce
AuraGenome, an LLM-powered framework for rapid, reusable, and scalable
generation of multi-layered circular genome visualizations. AuraGenome combines
a semantic-driven multi-agent workflow with an interactive visual analytics
system. The workflow employs seven specialized LLM-driven agents, each assigned
distinct roles such as intent recognition, layout planning, and code
generation, to transform raw genomic data into tailored visualizations. The
system supports multiple coordinated views tailored for genomic data, offering
ring, radial, and chord-based layouts to represent multi-layered circular
genome visualizations. In addition to enabling interactions and configuration
reuse, the system supports real-time refinement and high-quality report export.
We validate its effectiveness through two case studies and a comprehensive user
study. AuraGenome is available at: https://github.com/Darius18/AuraGenome.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市降低限速至30 km/h旨在提升道路安全、减少噪音污染及促进可持续交通，但如何确保驾驶员遵守限速是城市规划者的挑战。

Method: 应用计算机视觉语义分割模型分析Google街景图像，研究街道特征对车速的影响，并在米兰、阿姆斯特丹和迪拜验证方法。

Result: 窄街和高密度建筑环境与较低车速相关，开阔视野则相反。研究验证了方法在多城市的适用性，并开发了预测模型。

Conclusion: 仅限速不足以降低车速，需结合街道设计。研究为城市规划者提供了改善限速遵守的工具和指导。

Abstract: In recent years, cities have increasingly reduced speed limits from 50 km/h
to 30 km/h to enhance road safety, reduce noise pollution, and promote
sustainable modes of transportation. However, achieving compliance with these
new limits remains a key challenge for urban planners. This study investigates
drivers' compliance with the 30 km/h speed limit in Milan and examines how
street characteristics influence driving behavior. Our findings suggest that
the mere introduction of lower speed limits is not sufficient to reduce driving
speeds effectively, highlighting the need to understand how street design can
improve speed limit adherence. To comprehend this relationship, we apply
computer vision-based semantic segmentation models to Google Street View
images. A large-scale analysis reveals that narrower streets and densely built
environments are associated with lower speeds, whereas roads with greater
visibility and larger sky views encourage faster driving. To evaluate the
influence of the local context on speeding behaviour, we apply the developed
methodological framework to two additional cities: Amsterdam, which, similar to
Milan, is a historic European city not originally developed for cars, and
Dubai, which instead has developed in recent decades with a more car-centric
design. The results of the analyses largely confirm the findings obtained in
Milan, which demonstrates the broad applicability of the road design guidelines
for driver speed compliance identified in this paper. Finally, we develop a
machine learning model to predict driving speeds based on street
characteristics. We showcase the model's predictive power by estimating the
compliance with speed limits in Milan if the city were to adopt a 30 km/h speed
limit city-wide. The tool provides actionable insights for urban planners,
supporting the design of interventions to improve speed limit compliance.

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 论文研究了地球外核的热化学对流，探讨了在核心-地幔边界（CMB）下方是否存在稳定层的问题。通过数值模拟，发现化学分层区域可能形成局部稳定区域或全局层，且热化学模型中稳定区域的性质和形态受热驱动和化学驱动的相对强度影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨地球外核的热化学对流机制，特别是CMB下方是否存在稳定层及其对核心动力学的影响。

Method: 采用数值模拟方法，研究热、化学及热化学对流模型，参数范围包括Ekman数、热和化学通量Rayleigh数以及Prandtl数。

Result: 化学模型显示CMB下方存在轻元素积累（LEA），形成局部稳定区域或全局层；热化学模型中稳定区域的性质和形态受热驱动和化学驱动的相对强度影响。

Conclusion: 模拟揭示了地球核心顶部存在多种可能的稳定区域或全局层，其厚度和强度与地震观测一致，可能对地磁观测有影响。

Abstract: Thermochemical convection in Earth's outer core is driven by the
crystallisation of the inner core that releases latent heat and light elements.
A key question in core dynamics is whether a stable layer exists just below the
core-mantle boundary. Recent core convection simulations, accounting for CMB
heterogeneities, propose locally stable regions (or regional inversion lenses,
RILs) rather than a global layer, allowing both stable and unstable regions to
coexist. In this study, we consider a suite of numerical simulations of
thermal, chemical, and thermochemical convection models focussed on Ekman
number ($E=10^{-5}$) with thermal and chemical flux Rayleigh numbers
$\widetilde{Ra}_T=30-4000$ and $\widetilde{Ra}_C=30-100000$, and thermal and
chemical Prandtl numbers $Pr_T=1$ and $Pr_\xi=10$. Analysis of purely chemical
models reveals light element accumulation (LEA) below the CMB, resulting in
either locally stable regions near the poles or global layers, depending on the
strength of chemical forcing. These chemically stratified regions persist in
our thermochemical models even if the thermal field is fully destabilising. The
addition of a heterogeneous CMB heat flux leads to the formation of RILs driven
by thermal stratification. Stable regions in these thermochemical models have
varying locations, properties, and morphologies depending on whether thermal or
chemical convection dominates. In the investigated parameter range, these RILs
are O(100 km) thick, and their strength and thickness generally increase with
the strength of thermal driving; they are comparatively less sensitive to the
strength of chemical driving. Our simulations reveal a diverse range of
possible stable regions and/or a global layer at the top of Earth's core, with
a seismically plausible range of thickness and strength, which may also have a
signature in geomagnetic observations.

Result: 在量子分类任务中，QMoE表现优于标准量子神经网络，能有效学习复杂数据模式。

Conclusion: QMoE为可扩展和可解释的量子学习框架奠定了基础。

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) has emerged as a promising direction in the
noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, offering computational and memory
advantages by harnessing superposition and entanglement. However, QML models
often face challenges in scalability and expressiveness due to hardware
constraints. In this paper, we propose quantum mixture of experts (QMoE), a
novel quantum architecture that integrates the mixture of experts (MoE)
paradigm into the QML setting. QMoE comprises multiple parameterized quantum
circuits serving as expert models, along with a learnable quantum routing
mechanism that selects and aggregates specialized quantum experts per input.
The empirical results from the proposed QMoE on quantum classification tasks
demonstrate that it consistently outperforms standard quantum neural networks,
highlighting its effectiveness in learning complex data patterns. Our work
paves the way for scalable and interpretable quantum learning frameworks.

TL;DR: AttackBench是一个标准化评估框架，用于在一致条件下测试基于梯度的对抗攻击方法的有效性，以提高评估可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击评估方法不一致且不可靠，导致结果偏差和虚假安全感。

Method: 开发AttackBench框架，引入最优性指标，标准化测试条件。

Result: AttackBench能排名现有攻击方法，识别最可靠有效的攻击。

Conclusion: AttackBench为稳健性验证提供了可靠基础，支持持续更新。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in designing powerful adversarial evasion
attacks for robustness verification, the evaluation of these methods often
remains inconsistent and unreliable. Many assessments rely on mismatched
models, unverified implementations, and uneven computational budgets, which can
lead to biased results and a false sense of security. Consequently, robustness
claims built on such flawed testing protocols may be misleading and give a
false sense of security. As a concrete step toward improving evaluation
reliability, we present AttackBench, a benchmark framework developed to assess
the effectiveness of gradient-based attacks under standardized and reproducible
conditions. AttackBench serves as an evaluation tool that ranks existing attack
implementations based on a novel optimality metric, which enables researchers
and practitioners to identify the most reliable and effective attack for use in
subsequent robustness evaluations. The framework enforces consistent testing
conditions and enables continuous updates, making it a reliable foundation for
robustness verification.

TL;DR: SecureT2I是一个安全框架，用于防止基于扩散模型的文本引导图像编辑中的未经授权修改。它通过分类图像为允许和禁止集，并设计特定训练目标，实现对禁止集图像的模糊化处理，同时保持允许集的高质量编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决扩散模型在文本引导图像编辑中可能引发的伦理和版权问题，防止未经授权的修改。

Method: 将图像分类为允许和禁止集，设计特定损失函数，对禁止集图像鼓励模糊或语义模糊的输出，同时保持允许集的编辑质量。

Result: 实验表明，SecureT2I能有效降低禁止集图像的编辑质量，同时保持允许集的性能，并在未见输入上表现优于基线。

Conclusion: SecureT2I提供了一种轻量级且兼容性强的解决方案，解决了扩散模型在安全编辑中的核心挑战。

Abstract: Text-guided image manipulation with diffusion models enables flexible and
precise editing based on prompts, but raises ethical and copyright concerns due
to potential unauthorized modifications. To address this, we propose SecureT2I,
a secure framework designed to prevent unauthorized editing in diffusion-based
generative models. SecureT2I is compatible with both general-purpose and
domain-specific models and can be integrated via lightweight fine-tuning
without architectural changes. We categorize images into a permit set and a
forbid set based on editing permissions. For the permit set, the model learns
to perform high-quality manipulations as usual. For the forbid set, we
introduce training objectives that encourage vague or semantically ambiguous
outputs (e.g., blurred images), thereby suppressing meaningful edits. The core
challenge is to block unauthorized editing while preserving editing quality for
permitted inputs. To this end, we design separate loss functions that guide
selective editing behavior. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and
models show that SecureT2I effectively degrades manipulation quality on
forbidden images while maintaining performance on permitted ones. We also
evaluate generalization to unseen inputs and find that SecureT2I consistently
outperforms baselines. Additionally, we analyze different vagueness strategies
and find that resize-based degradation offers the best trade-off for secure
manipulation control.

Motivation: 现有深度水印技术容量低且易受比特错误影响，难以满足密码学应用需求。

Method: 结合裁剪容量扩展机制和ERPA错误校正模块，使用DCSS定位并纠正比特错误。

Result: 在2048位数字签名嵌入中，零比特错误率从1.2%提升至86.3%。

Conclusion: README填补了信号级水印与密码学安全之间的鸿沟，适用于高保障应用。

Abstract: Deep learning-based watermarking has emerged as a promising solution for
robust image authentication and protection. However, existing models are
limited by low embedding capacity and vulnerability to bit-level errors, making
them unsuitable for cryptographic applications such as digital signatures,
which require over 2048 bits of error-free data. In this paper, we propose
README (Robust Error-Aware Digital Signature via Deep WaterMarking ModEl), a
novel framework that enables robust, verifiable, and error-tolerant digital
signatures within images. Our method combines a simple yet effective
cropping-based capacity scaling mechanism with ERPA (ERror PAinting Module), a
lightweight error correction module designed to localize and correct bit errors
using Distinct Circular Subsum Sequences (DCSS). Without requiring any
fine-tuning of existing pretrained watermarking models, README significantly
boosts the zero-bit-error image rate (Z.B.I.R) from 1.2% to 86.3% when
embedding 2048-bit digital signatures into a single image, even under
real-world distortions. Moreover, our use of perceptual hash-based signature
verification ensures public verifiability and robustness against tampering. The
proposed framework unlocks a new class of high-assurance applications for deep
watermarking, bridging the gap between signal-level watermarking and
cryptographic security.

Conclusion: Expotion在音乐生成中表现优异，并提供了新的数据集支持未来研究。

Abstract: We propose Expotion (Facial Expression and Motion Control for Multimodal
Music Generation), a generative model leveraging multimodal visual controls -
specifically, human facial expressions and upper-body motion - as well as text
prompts to produce expressive and temporally accurate music. We adopt
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) on the pretrained text-to-music
generation model, enabling fine-grained adaptation to the multimodal controls
using a small dataset. To ensure precise synchronization between video and
music, we introduce a temporal smoothing strategy to align multiple modalities.
Experiments demonstrate that integrating visual features alongside textual
descriptions enhances the overall quality of generated music in terms of
musicality, creativity, beat-tempo consistency, temporal alignment with the
video, and text adherence, surpassing both proposed baselines and existing
state-of-the-art video-to-music generation models. Additionally, we introduce a
novel dataset consisting of 7 hours of synchronized video recordings capturing
expressive facial and upper-body gestures aligned with corresponding music,
providing significant potential for future research in multimodal and
interactive music generation.

multiple evaluation strategies are being developed. In this paper, based on
previous literature, we outline four emerging frameworks to perform evaluation

framework to clinically evaluate QI methods without ground truth. Third, a
framework to evaluate QI methods for joint detection and quantification tasks
is outlined. Finally, we outline a framework to evaluate QI methods that output
multi-dimensional parameters, such as radiomic features. We review these
frameworks, discussing their utilities and limitations. Further, we examine
future research areas in evaluation of QI methods. Given the recent
advancements in PET, including long axial field-of-view scanners and the
development of artificial-intelligence algorithms, we present these frameworks

Result: 在Navier-Stokes方程数据集上，MSE降低81.3%，MAE降低52.3%。

Conclusion: SDKD框架有效捕捉高频变化和长期趋势，同时降低计算复杂度。

Abstract: Spatiotemporal forecasting tasks, such as traffic flow, combustion dynamics,
and weather forecasting, often require complex models that suffer from low
training efficiency and high memory consumption. This paper proposes a
lightweight framework, Spectral Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (termed SDKD),
which transfers the multi-scale spatiotemporal representations from a complex
teacher model to a more efficient lightweight student network. The teacher
model follows an encoder-latent evolution-decoder architecture, where its
latent evolution module decouples high-frequency details and low-frequency
trends using convolution and Transformer (global low-frequency modeler).
However, the multi-layer convolution and deconvolution structures result in
slow training and high memory usage. To address these issues, we propose a
frequency-aligned knowledge distillation strategy, which extracts multi-scale
spectral features from the teacher's latent space, including both high and low
frequency components, to guide the lightweight student model in capturing both
local fine-grained variations and global evolution patterns. Experimental
results show that SDKD significantly improves performance, achieving reductions
of up to 81.3% in MSE and in MAE 52.3% on the Navier-Stokes equation dataset.
The framework effectively captures both high-frequency variations and long-term
trends while reducing computational complexity. Our codes are available at

Abstract: Medical Image Grounding (MIG), which involves localizing specific regions in
medical images based on textual descriptions, requires models to not only
perceive regions but also deduce spatial relationships of these regions.
Existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for MIG often rely on Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) with large amounts of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning
annotations, which are expensive and time-consuming to acquire. Recently,
DeepSeek-R1 demonstrated that Large Language Models (LLMs) can acquire
reasoning abilities through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) without
requiring CoT annotations. In this paper, we adapt the GRPO reinforcement
learning framework to VLMs for Medical Image Grounding. We propose the
Spatial-Semantic Rewarded Group Relative Policy Optimization to train the model
without CoT reasoning annotations. Specifically, we introduce Spatial-Semantic
Rewards, which combine spatial accuracy reward and semantic consistency reward
to provide nuanced feedback for both spatially positive and negative
completions. Additionally, we propose to use the Chain-of-Box template, which
integrates visual information of referring bounding boxes into the <think>
reasoning process, enabling the model to explicitly reason about spatial
regions during intermediate steps. Experiments on three datasets MS-CXR,
ChestX-ray8, and M3D-RefSeg demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in Medical Image Grounding. Ablation studies
further validate the effectiveness of each component in our approach. Code,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是通过观察从环境中提取有意义信息，以演示方式学习执行活动。

Method: 方法结合了拓扑可供性记忆和Transformer架构，通过提取环境结构的可供性来选择合适的动作，并检测动作偏差。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能学习到有意义的表示，提高性能并在动作偏差时表现稳健。

Conclusion: 结论是提出的方法在交互式模拟环境中表现出色，能够有效规划目标导向动作。

Abstract: Learning to perform activities through demonstration requires extracting
meaningful information about the environment from observations. In this
research, we investigate the challenge of planning high-level goal-oriented
actions in a simulation setting from an egocentric perspective. We present a
novel task, interactive action planning, and propose an approach that combines
topological affordance memory with transformer architecture. The process of
memorizing the environment's structure through extracting affordances
facilitates selecting appropriate actions based on the context. Moreover, the
memory model allows us to detect action deviations while accomplishing specific
objectives. To assess the method's versatility, we evaluate it in a realistic
interactive simulation environment. Our experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed approach learns meaningful representations, resulting in improved
performance and robust when action deviations occur.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的数据保护概念在AI时代已显不足，亟需明确界定保护范围并严格执行，以避免社会和个体层面的风险。

Method: 提出了一个四层分类法框架，分析AI全流程中的数据保护需求，并探讨了每层的代表性技术方法。

Result: 揭示了监管盲点，为未来AI技术和治理提供了与可信数据实践对齐的结构化视角。

Conclusion: 论文强调了重新思考现代AI技术数据保护的紧迫性，并为开发者、研究者和监管者提供了及时指导。

Abstract: The (generative) artificial intelligence (AI) era has profoundly reshaped the
meaning and value of data. No longer confined to static content, data now
permeates every stage of the AI lifecycle from the training samples that shape
model parameters to the prompts and outputs that drive real-world model
deployment. This shift renders traditional notions of data protection
insufficient, while the boundaries of what needs safeguarding remain poorly
defined. Failing to safeguard data in AI systems can inflict societal and
individual, underscoring the urgent need to clearly delineate the scope of and
rigorously enforce data protection. In this perspective, we propose a
four-level taxonomy, including non-usability, privacy preservation,
traceability, and deletability, that captures the diverse protection needs
arising in modern (generative) AI models and systems. Our framework offers a
structured understanding of the trade-offs between data utility and control,
spanning the entire AI pipeline, including training datasets, model weights,
system prompts, and AI-generated content. We analyze representative technical
approaches at each level and reveal regulatory blind spots that leave critical
assets exposed. By offering a structured lens to align future AI technologies
and governance with trustworthy data practices, we underscore the urgency of
rethinking data protection for modern AI techniques and provide timely guidance
for developers, researchers, and regulators alike.

TL;DR: NeuralDMD结合神经隐式表示与动态模式分解（DMD），从稀疏、噪声的测量中重建连续时空动态，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学成像常面对从未见过的动态系统，且测量数据稀疏、噪声大，需要一种模型无关的方法来重建动态。

Method: 结合神经隐式表示（捕捉复杂空间结构）与DMD（提供线性动态模式，引导训练并支持低维表示和预测）。

Result: 在北美近地表风速场和银河中心黑洞Sgr A*等离子体演化两个实际问题上，NeuralDMD表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: NeuralDMD是一种通用工具，适用于地球科学、天文学等领域的动态系统成像。

Abstract: Dynamical systems are ubiquitous within science and engineering, from
turbulent flow across aircraft wings to structural variability of proteins.
Although some systems are well understood and simulated, scientific imaging
often confronts never-before-seen dynamics observed through indirect, noisy,
and highly sparse measurements. We present NeuralDMD, a model-free framework
that combines neural implicit representations with Dynamic Mode Decomposition
(DMD) to reconstruct continuous spatio-temporal dynamics from such
measurements. The expressiveness of neural representations enables capturing
complex spatial structures, while the linear dynamical modes of DMD introduce
an inductive bias that guides training and supports stable, low-dimensional
representations and forecasting. We validate NeuralDMD on two real-world
problems: reconstructing near-surface wind-speed fields over North America from
sparse station observations, and recovering the evolution of plasma near the
Galactic-center black hole, Sgr A*. In both cases, NeuralDMD outperforms
established baselines, demonstrating its potential as a general tool for
imaging dynamical systems across geoscience, astronomy, and beyond.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于人类视觉发展过程的AI视觉训练方法（DVD），显著提升了AI在形状识别、抗干扰和对抗攻击方面的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI视觉与人类视觉在形状识别、抗干扰和对抗攻击上的显著差异。

Method: 通过模拟人类视觉从婴儿到成年的发展过程，设计了一种新的视觉训练方法（DVD）。

Result: 该方法使AI在形状识别、抗干扰和对抗攻击方面表现优于传统大规模训练模型。

Conclusion: 通过优化学习方式而非增加数据量，可以实现更高效、更接近人类视觉的AI系统。

Abstract: Despite years of research and the dramatic scaling of artificial intelligence
(AI) systems, a striking misalignment between artificial and human vision
persists. Contrary to humans, AI heavily relies on texture-features rather than
shape information, lacks robustness to image distortions, remains highly
vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and struggles to recognise simple abstract
shapes within complex backgrounds. To close this gap, we here introduce a
solution that arises from a previously underexplored direction: rather than
scaling up, we take inspiration from how human vision develops from early
infancy into adulthood. We quantified the visual maturation by synthesising
decades of psychophysical and neurophysiological research into a novel
developmental visual diet (DVD) for AI vision. We show that guiding AI systems
through this human-inspired curriculum produces models that closely align with
human behaviour on every hallmark of robust vision tested yielding the
strongest reported reliance on shape information to date, abstract shape
recognition beyond the state of the art, higher robustness to image
corruptions, and stronger resilience to adversarial attacks. By outperforming
high parameter AI foundation models trained on orders of magnitude more data,
we provide evidence that robust AI vision can be achieved by guiding the way
how a model learns, not merely how much it learns, offering a
resource-efficient route toward safer and more human-like artificial visual
systems.

Method: 分析了800个CNN模型的1600万次试验和113名人类参与者的6825次试验，通过数据域采样方法进行评估。

Result: CNN在某些情况下可以超越人类表现，其偏差主要取决于训练与测试数据的距离。

Conclusion: CNN在解释可视化图像时表现出简单而优雅的行为，其性能与训练-测试距离密切相关。

Abstract: We present a data-domain sampling regime for quantifying CNNs' graphic
perception behaviors. This regime lets us evaluate CNNs' ratio estimation
ability in bar charts from three perspectives: sensitivity to training-test
distribution discrepancies, stability to limited samples, and relative
expertise to human observers. After analyzing 16 million trials from 800 CNNs
models and 6,825 trials from 113 human participants, we arrived at a simple and
actionable conclusion: CNNs can outperform humans and their biases simply
depend on the training-test distance. We show evidence of this simple, elegant
behavior of the machines when they interpret visualization images. osf.io/gfqc3

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer的模型，用于预测阿尔茨海默病（AD）患者的下一次临床访问阶段，并与RNN模型进行了比较，展示了其在数据缺失情况下的强大预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病（AD）是一种无法治愈的神经退行性疾病，早期检测对干预疾病进展至关重要。

Method: 使用Transformer模型，基于患者历史访问序列的特征预测AD进展阶段，并与LSTM、GRU等RNN模型进行比较。

Result: 模型在数据缺失情况下表现优异，尤其在识别疾病阶段转换患者方面具有优势。

Conclusion: 该模型有望提升AD的早期诊断效果，改善患者预后。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with no known cure
that affects tens of millions of people worldwide. Early detection of AD is
critical for timely intervention to halt or slow the progression of the
disease. In this study, we propose a Transformer model for predicting the stage
of AD progression at a subject's next clinical visit using features from a
sequence of visits extracted from the subject's visit history. We also
rigorously compare our model to recurrent neural networks (RNNs) such as long
short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU), and minimalRNN and assess
their performances based on factors such as the length of prior visits and data
imbalance. We test the importance of different feature categories and visit
history, as well as compare the model to a newer Transformer-based model
optimized for time series. Our model demonstrates strong predictive performance
despite missing visits and missing features in available visits, particularly
in identifying converter subjects -- individuals transitioning to more severe
disease stages -- an area that has posed significant challenges in longitudinal
prediction. The results highlight the model's potential in enhancing early
diagnosis and patient outcomes.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CAPIMAC的方法，通过自排斥贪婪锚点搜索和一致性感知填充模块，解决多模态数据不平衡和未对齐的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态数据常因传感器频率不一致或设备故障而不完整且未对齐，现有方法未能有效填补缺失数据，影响融合质量。

Method: 结合自排斥随机游走和贪婪算法（SRGASM）识别锚点，再通过噪声对比学习设计一致性感知填充模块（CAPM）进行插补和对齐。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在基准数据集上表现优越。

Conclusion: CAPIMAC有效提升了不平衡和未对齐多模态数据的融合质量，代码将开源。

Abstract: Multimodal representation is faithful and highly effective in describing
real-world data samples' characteristics by describing their complementary
information. However, the collected data often exhibits incomplete and
misaligned characteristics due to factors such as inconsistent sensor
frequencies and device malfunctions. Existing research has not effectively
addressed the issue of filling missing data in scenarios where multiview data
are both imbalanced and misaligned. Instead, it relies on class-level alignment
of the available data. Thus, it results in some data samples not being
well-matched, thereby affecting the quality of data fusion. In this paper, we
propose the Consistency-Aware Padding for Incomplete Multimodal Alignment
Clustering Based on Self-Repellent Greedy Anchor Search(CAPIMAC) to tackle the
problem of filling imbalanced and misaligned data in multimodal datasets.
Specifically, we propose a self-repellent greedy anchor search module(SRGASM),
which employs a self-repellent random walk combined with a greedy algorithm to
identify anchor points for re-representing incomplete and misaligned multimodal
data. Subsequently, based on noise-contrastive learning, we design a
consistency-aware padding module (CAPM) to effectively interpolate and align
imbalanced and misaligned data, thereby improving the quality of multimodal
data fusion. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method
over benchmark datasets. The code will be publicly released at
https://github.com/Autism-mm/CAPIMAC.git.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM通过损失景观几何改善泛化性能，但在噪声数据和隐私问题上面临挑战。数据归因（data attribution）提供了一种解决方案，但传统方法如IF在SAM的双层结构中不适用或不准确。

Method: 开发了两种数据评估方法：基于Hessian的IF和基于梯度轨迹的IF。前者通过闭式度量提供全面的数据影响估计，后者利用训练中的梯度轨迹信息提高评估效率和准确性。

Result: 实验证明这两种方法在数据评估和参数调优中有效，适用于识别错误标记数据、模型编辑和增强可解释性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为SAM中的数据影响评估提供了创新解决方案，适用于多种实际场景。

Abstract: Sharpness-aware Minimization (SAM) improves generalization in large-scale
model training by linking loss landscape geometry to generalization. However,
challenges such as mislabeled noisy data and privacy concerns have emerged as
significant issues. Data attribution, which identifies the contributions of
specific training samples, offers a promising solution. However, directly
rendering existing data influence evaluation tools such as influence functions
(IF) to SAM will be inapplicable or inaccurate as SAM utilizes an inner loop to
find model perturbations that maximize loss, which the outer loop then
minimizes, resulting in a doubled computational structure. Additionally, this
bilevel structure complicates the modeling of data influence on the parameters.
In this paper, based on the IF, we develop two innovative data valuation
methods for SAM, each offering unique benefits in different scenarios: the
Hessian-based IF and the Gradient Trajectory-based IF. The first one provides a
comprehensive estimation of data influence using a closed-form measure that
relies only on the trained model weights. In contrast, the other IF for SAM
utilizes gradient trajectory information during training for more accurate and
efficient data assessment. Extensive experiments demonstrate their
effectiveness in data evaluation and parameter tuning, with applications in
identifying mislabeled data, model editing, and enhancing interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dreamer算法的潜在空间压缩可能导致关键信息丢失，影响智能体性能。现有方法（如Δ-IRIS和DIAMOND）虽能解决这一问题，但直接从像素训练降低了效率。

Method: EMERALD使用空间潜在状态和MaskGIT预测，生成潜在空间中的准确轨迹。

Result: 在Crafter基准测试中，EMERALD实现了新的最先进性能，首次在10M环境步内超越人类专家表现，并解锁了所有22项成就。

Conclusion: EMERALD提供了一种高效且准确的世界建模方法，显著提升了智能体性能。

Abstract: The Dreamer algorithm has recently obtained remarkable performance across
diverse environment domains by training powerful agents with simulated
trajectories. However, the compressed nature of its world model's latent space
can result in the loss of crucial information, negatively affecting the agent's
performance. Recent approaches, such as $\Delta$-IRIS and DIAMOND, address this
limitation by training more accurate world models. However, these methods
require training agents directly from pixels, which reduces training efficiency
and prevents the agent from benefiting from the inner representations learned
by the world model. In this work, we propose an alternative approach to world
modeling that is both accurate and efficient. We introduce EMERALD (Efficient
MaskEd latent tRAnsformer worLD model), a world model using a spatial latent
state with MaskGIT predictions to generate accurate trajectories in latent
space and improve the agent performance. On the Crafter benchmark, EMERALD
achieves new state-of-the-art performance, becoming the first method to surpass
human experts performance within 10M environment steps. Our method also
succeeds to unlock all 22 Crafter achievements at least once during evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DFKD方法通常假设教师模型可信，但忽略了非可信教师（如NTL教师）对知识蒸馏的负面影响，导致知识转移效率低下。

Method: 提出Adversarial Trap Escaping (ATEsc)方法，通过分析合成样本的对抗鲁棒性，将其分为ID-like和OOD-like两组，分别用于知识蒸馏和遗忘误导知识。

Result: 实验证明ATEsc能有效提升DFKD在NTL教师下的性能，改善知识转移效果。

Conclusion: ATEsc为DFKD在非可信教师场景下的应用提供了新思路，显著提升了模型的鲁棒性和安全性。

Abstract: Data-free knowledge distillation (DFKD) transfers knowledge from a teacher to
a student without access the real in-distribution (ID) data. Its common
solution is to use a generator to synthesize fake data and use them as a
substitute for real ID data. However, existing works typically assume teachers
are trustworthy, leaving the robustness and security of DFKD from untrusted
teachers largely unexplored. In this work, we conduct the first investigation
into distilling non-transferable learning (NTL) teachers using DFKD, where the
transferability from an ID domain to an out-of-distribution (OOD) domain is
prohibited. We find that NTL teachers fool DFKD through divert the generator's
attention from the useful ID knowledge to the misleading OOD knowledge. This
hinders ID knowledge transfer but prioritizes OOD knowledge transfer. To
mitigate this issue, we propose Adversarial Trap Escaping (ATEsc) to benefit
DFKD by identifying and filtering out OOD-like synthetic samples. Specifically,
inspired by the evidence that NTL teachers show stronger adversarial robustness
on OOD samples than ID samples, we split synthetic samples into two groups
according to their robustness. The fragile group is treated as ID-like data and
used for normal knowledge distillation, while the robust group is seen as
OOD-like data and utilized for forgetting OOD knowledge. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of ATEsc for improving DFKD against NTL teachers.
Code is released at https://github.com/tmllab/2025_ICML_ATEsc.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病缺乏有效治疗手段，早期诊断至关重要。视网膜图像作为一种非侵入性检测方式，具有潜力。

Method: 使用Transformer架构和可解释AI技术（如Grad-CAM）分析视网膜图像，识别与疾病相关的特征区域。

Result: Retformer模型在多种性能指标上优于基准算法，最高提升11%。

Conclusion: Retformer为阿尔茨海默病的早期诊断提供了一种高效且可解释的新方法。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects
millions worldwide. In the absence of effective treatment options, early
diagnosis is crucial for initiating management strategies to delay disease
onset and slow down its progression. In this study, we propose Retformer, a
novel transformer-based architecture for detecting AD using retinal imaging
modalities, leveraging the power of transformers and explainable artificial
intelligence. The Retformer model is trained on datasets of different
modalities of retinal images from patients with AD and age-matched healthy
controls, enabling it to learn complex patterns and relationships between image
features and disease diagnosis. To provide insights into the decision-making
process of our model, we employ the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping
algorithm to visualize the feature importance maps, highlighting the regions of
the retinal images that contribute most significantly to the classification
outcome. These findings are compared to existing clinical studies on detecting
AD using retinal biomarkers, allowing us to identify the most important
features for AD detection in each imaging modality. The Retformer model
outperforms a variety of benchmark algorithms across different performance
metrics by margins of up to 11\.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督学习方法（如MAE、对比学习）未充分考虑农业景观的时间特性（如自然周期），因此需要针对农业场景设计新的预训练任务。

Method: 提出三种农业特定的预训练任务：时间差异预测（TD）、时间频率预测（FP）和未来帧预测（FF）。

Result: 在SICKLE数据集上，FF在作物制图上达到69.6% IoU，FP将产量预测误差降至30.7% MAPE；在印度全国尺度上，FF在田界划分任务中达到54.2% IoU。

Conclusion: 农业特定的预训练任务显著提升了模型性能，证明了时间特性在农业遥感中的重要性。

Abstract: Self Supervised Learning(SSL) has emerged as a prominent paradigm for
label-efficient learning, and has been widely utilized by remote sensing
foundation models(RSFMs). Recent RSFMs including SatMAE, DoFA, primarily rely
on masked autoencoding(MAE), contrastive learning or some combination of them.
However, these pretext tasks often overlook the unique temporal characteristics
of agricultural landscape, namely nature's cycle. Motivated by this gap, we
propose three novel agriculture-specific pretext tasks, namely Time-Difference
Prediction(TD), Temporal Frequency Prediction(FP), and Future-Frame
Prediction(FF). Comprehensive evaluation on SICKLE dataset shows FF achieves
69.6% IoU on crop mapping and FP reduces yield prediction error to 30.7% MAPE,
outperforming all baselines, and TD remains competitive on most tasks. Further,
we also scale FF to the national scale of India, achieving 54.2% IoU
outperforming all baselines on field boundary delineation on FTW India dataset.

Motivation: 扩散模型在数据集蒸馏任务中表现不佳，尤其在低IPC设置下样本多样性不足。

Method: 从信息论角度定义原型信息I(X;Y)和上下文信息H(X|Y)，提出最大化I(X;Y)+βH(X|Y)的IGDS方法，并通过变分估计实现。

Result: 在Tiny ImageNet和ImageNet子集上，IGDS显著优于现有方法，尤其在低IPC情况下。

Conclusion: IGDS通过信息论指导扩散采样，有效提升数据集蒸馏性能，尤其在低IPC场景下。

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to create a compact dataset that retains essential
information while maintaining model performance. Diffusion models (DMs) have
shown promise for this task but struggle in low images-per-class (IPC)
settings, where generated samples lack diversity. In this paper, we address
this issue from an information-theoretic perspective by identifying two key
types of information that a distilled dataset must preserve: ($i$) prototype
information $\mathrm{I}(X;Y)$, which captures label-relevant features; and
($ii$) contextual information $\mathrm{H}(X | Y)$, which preserves intra-class
variability. Here, $(X,Y)$ represents the pair of random variables
corresponding to the input data and its ground truth label, respectively.
Observing that the required contextual information scales with IPC, we propose
maximizing $\mathrm{I}(X;Y) + \beta \mathrm{H}(X | Y)$ during the DM sampling
process, where $\beta$ is IPC-dependent. Since directly computing
$\mathrm{I}(X;Y)$ and $\mathrm{H}(X | Y)$ is intractable, we develop
variational estimations to tightly lower-bound these quantities via a
data-driven approach. Our approach, information-guided diffusion sampling
(IGDS), seamlessly integrates with diffusion models and improves dataset
distillation across all IPC settings. Experiments on Tiny ImageNet and ImageNet
subsets show that IGDS significantly outperforms existing methods, particularly
in low-IPC regimes. The code will be released upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NAS方法在真实部署中面临架构适应性差、搜索成本高和性能不一致的挑战。

Method: DANCE将架构搜索重新定义为连续演化问题，引入连续架构分布、统一架构空间和多阶段训练策略。

Result: 在五个数据集上的实验表明，DANCE在准确性和搜索成本上均优于现有NAS方法，并能适应不同硬件需求。

Conclusion: DANCE通过连续演化和多阶段优化，显著提升了NAS的适应性和效率。

Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has emerged as a powerful approach for
automating neural network design. However, existing NAS methods face critical
limitations in real-world deployments: architectures lack adaptability across
scenarios, each deployment context requires costly separate searches, and
performance consistency across diverse platforms remains challenging. We
propose DANCE (Dynamic Architectures with Neural Continuous Evolution), which
reformulates architecture search as a continuous evolution problem through
learning distributions over architectural components. DANCE introduces three
key innovations: a continuous architecture distribution enabling smooth
adaptation, a unified architecture space with learned selection gates for
efficient sampling, and a multi-stage training strategy for effective
deployment optimization. Extensive experiments across five datasets demonstrate
DANCE's effectiveness. Our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art NAS
approaches in terms of accuracy while significantly reducing search costs.
Under varying computational constraints, DANCE maintains robust performance
while smoothly adapting architectures to different hardware requirements. The

*Wenhao Li,Xiu Su,Jingyi Wu,Feng Yang,Yang Liu,Yi Chen,Shan You,Chang Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SEED的自进化蒸馏方法，通过识别和消除大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）中的幻觉问题，并将净化后的知识蒸馏回模型，显著提升了模型的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在多领域表现出色，但幻觉问题限制了其可信度和应用潜力。现有方法依赖外部工具或多轮推理比较，增加了推理时间。

Method: 提出SEED方法，包括识别和消除幻觉、Mode-Seeking Evolving蒸馏以避免输出空间空洞，以及引入Hallucination Elimination Adapter学习净化知识。

Result: 在多个基准测试中验证了SEED的优越性，显著减少了幻觉问题。例如，LLaVA-1.5在POPE-Random指标上的F1分数从81.3提升至88.3。

Conclusion: SEED方法通过自进化蒸馏有效缓解了LVLMs的幻觉问题，提升了模型性能和应用潜力。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
advancements in numerous areas such as multimedia. However, hallucination
issues significantly limit their credibility and application potential.
Existing mitigation methods typically rely on external tools or the comparison
of multi-round inference, which significantly increase inference time. In this
paper, we propose \textbf{SE}lf-\textbf{E}volving \textbf{D}istillation
(\textbf{SEED}), which identifies hallucinations within the inner knowledge of
LVLMs, isolates and purges them, and then distills the purified knowledge back
into the model, enabling self-evolution. Furthermore, we identified that
traditional distillation methods are prone to inducing void spaces in the
output space of LVLMs. To address this issue, we propose a Mode-Seeking
Evolving approach, which performs distillation to capture the dominant modes of
the purified knowledge distribution, thereby avoiding the chaotic results that
could emerge from void spaces. Moreover, we introduce a Hallucination
Elimination Adapter, which corrects the dark knowledge of the original model by
learning purified knowledge. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks
validate the superiority of our SEED, demonstrating substantial improvements in
mitigating hallucinations for representative LVLM models such as LLaVA-1.5 and
InternVL2. Remarkably, the F1 score of LLaVA-1.5 on the hallucination
evaluation metric POPE-Random improved from 81.3 to 88.3.

*Hanseon Joo,Hayoung Choi,Ook Lee,Minjong Cheon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Modulation Joint KAN (MJKAN)，结合FiLM机制和RBF激活函数，解决了KANs的高计算成本和性能问题，在函数回归任务中表现优异，但在图像和文本分类中需调整基函数数量以优化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KANs因其可学习的单变量函数替代固定激活函数而受到关注，但存在高计算成本和分类任务性能不足的问题。MJKAN旨在解决这些限制。

Method: MJKAN结合FiLM机制和RBF激活函数，形成混合架构，兼具KANs的非线性表达能力和MLPs的效率。

Result: 在函数回归任务中表现优异，优于MLPs；在图像和文本分类中与MLPs竞争，但需调整基函数数量以避免过拟合。

Conclusion: MJKAN继承了KANs的理论优势，同时提升了计算效率和实用性，是一种灵活的架构。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have garnered attention for replacing fixed
activation functions with learnable univariate functions, but they exhibit
practical limitations, including high computational costs and performance
deficits in general classification tasks. In this paper, we propose the
Modulation Joint KAN (MJKAN), a novel neural network layer designed to overcome
these challenges. MJKAN integrates a FiLM (Feature-wise Linear Modulation)-like
mechanism with Radial Basis Function (RBF) activations, creating a hybrid
architecture that combines the non-linear expressive power of KANs with the
efficiency of Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs). We empirically validated MJKAN's
performance across a diverse set of benchmarks, including function regression,
image classification (MNIST, CIFAR-10/100), and natural language processing (AG
News, SMS Spam). The results demonstrate that MJKAN achieves superior
approximation capabilities in function regression tasks, significantly
outperforming MLPs, with performance improving as the number of basis functions
increases. Conversely, in image and text classification, its performance was
competitive with MLPs but revealed a critical dependency on the number of basis
functions. We found that a smaller basis size was crucial for better
generalization, highlighting that the model's capacity must be carefully tuned
to the complexity of the data to prevent overfitting. In conclusion, MJKAN
offers a flexible architecture that inherits the theoretical advantages of KANs
while improving computational efficiency and practical viability.

*Pablo G. Morato,Charalampos P. Andriotis,Seyran Khademi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了两种基于贝叶斯主动学习的批量采样策略（ConBatch-BAL），用于解决标注成本差异和预算限制问题，并在真实地理空间数据集上验证其效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中，数据点标注成本差异和预算限制阻碍了主动学习策略的采用，需要开发适应这些约束的高效方法。

Method: 提出两种策略：动态阈值和贪婪采样，均基于贝叶斯神经网络的不确定性度量选择样本，动态阈值策略在批次内重新分配预算，贪婪策略则逐步选择样本。

Result: 在真实地理空间数据集上测试表明，ConBatch-BAL策略能减少主动学习迭代和数据获取成本，甚至优于无约束基线方法。

Conclusion: ConBatch-BAL策略在标注成本高和预算受限的场景中具有实际应用价值，能有效提升主动学习效率。

Abstract: Varying annotation costs among data points and budget constraints can hinder
the adoption of active learning strategies in real-world applications. This
work introduces two Bayesian active learning strategies for batch acquisition
under constraints (ConBatch-BAL), one based on dynamic thresholding and one
following greedy acquisition. Both select samples using uncertainty metrics
computed via Bayesian neural networks. The dynamic thresholding strategy
redistributes the budget across the batch, while the greedy one selects the
top-ranked sample at each step, limited by the remaining budget. Focusing on
scenarios with costly data annotation and geospatial constraints, we also
release two new real-world datasets containing geolocated aerial images of
buildings, annotated with energy efficiency or typology classes. The
ConBatch-BAL strategies are benchmarked against a random acquisition baseline
on these datasets under various budget and cost scenarios. The results show
that the developed ConBatch-BAL strategies can reduce active learning
iterations and data acquisition costs in real-world settings, and even
outperform the unconstrained baseline solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于对开发具有人工（通用）智能的虚拟代理的需求增加，世界模型成为近年来的热门话题。本文旨在澄清世界模型的本质及其目标。

Method: 通过批判现有世界模型学派，提出了一种基于分层、多级和混合表示的新架构，并结合生成和自我监督学习框架。

Result: 提出了一种通用世界模型的新架构，支持物理性、代理性和嵌套性（PAN）的AGI系统。

Conclusion: 世界模型的主要目标是模拟现实世界中的所有可行动可能性，以支持有目的的推理和行动。

Abstract: World Model, the supposed algorithmic surrogate of the real-world environment
which biological agents experience with and act upon, has been an emerging
topic in recent years because of the rising needs to develop virtual agents
with artificial (general) intelligence. There has been much debate on what a
world model really is, how to build it, how to use it, and how to evaluate it.
In this essay, starting from the imagination in the famed Sci-Fi classic Dune,
and drawing inspiration from the concept of "hypothetical thinking" in
psychology literature, we offer critiques of several schools of thoughts on
world modeling, and argue the primary goal of a world model to be simulating
all actionable possibilities of the real world for purposeful reasoning and
acting. Building on the critiques, we propose a new architecture for a
general-purpose world model, based on hierarchical, multi-level, and mixed
continuous/discrete representations, and a generative and self-supervision
learning framework, with an outlook of a Physical, Agentic, and Nested (PAN)
AGI system enabled by such a model.

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于自动微分（AD）的方法，用于校正衍射图案裁剪偏移，提升ptychography重建的自动化与鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ptychography重建中，衍射图案裁剪偏移会导致收敛慢、相位包裹和图像保真度降低等问题，尤其在反射几何或宽带照明条件下更为严重。

Method: 将裁剪偏移作为可优化参数，通过自动微分将其整合到反向传播循环中，同时优化物体、探针和偏移位置。

Result: 仿真显示，即使初始偏移达5像素，方法仍能实现亚像素校正（平均偏差<0.5像素），EUV实验进一步验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: AD策略显著提升了ptychography重建的自动化与鲁棒性，适用于多种实验条件。

Abstract: Ptychography, a coherent diffraction imaging technique, has become an
indispensable tool in materials characterization, biological imaging, and
nanostructure analysis due to its capability for high-resolution, lensless
reconstruction of complex-valued images. In typical workflows, raw diffraction
patterns are commonly cropped to isolate the valid central region before
reconstruction. However, if the crop is misaligned from the diffraction
pattern's zero-order, reconstruction may suffer from slower convergence, phase
wrapping, and reduced image fidelity. These issues are further exacerbated in
experimental configurations involving reflective geometries or broadband
illumination, where incorrect cropping introduces systematic preprocessing
errors that compromise the entire ptychographic inversion. To address this
challenge, we present an approach based on automatic differentiation (AD),
where the cropping shift is treated as an optimizable parameter within the
reconstruction framework. By integrating shift correction into the
backpropagation loop, our method simultaneously refines the object, probe, and
shift positions without requiring manual tuning. Simulation results demonstrate
that, even with initial offsets ranging up to 5 pixels, the proposed method
achieves subpixel correction, with an average deviation below 0.5 pixels.
Experiments in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) regime further validate the
method's robustness and effectiveness. This AD-based strategy enhances the
automation and robustness of ptychographic reconstructions, and is adaptable to
diverse experimental conditions.

TL;DR: SPATIA是一个多尺度生成和预测模型，用于空间转录组学，通过融合细胞形态和基因表达数据，学习统一的、空间感知的表示，并在多个任务中优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解细胞形态、基因表达和空间组织如何共同影响组织功能是生物学中的核心挑战，现有方法通常孤立或低分辨率地分析这些模态。

Method: SPATIA通过跨注意力融合细胞形态和基因表达数据，生成细胞级嵌入，并使用Transformer模块在空间邻域和全组织尺度上捕获依赖关系。

Result: SPATIA在12个任务中优于13个现有模型，并能生成反映转录组扰动的真实细胞形态。

Conclusion: SPATIA为空间转录组学提供了一种统一的、多尺度的建模方法，显著提升了性能和应用潜力。

Abstract: Understanding how cellular morphology, gene expression, and spatial
organization jointly shape tissue function is a central challenge in biology.
Image-based spatial transcriptomics technologies now provide high-resolution
measurements of cell images and gene expression profiles, but machine learning
methods typically analyze these modalities in isolation or at limited
resolution. We address the problem of learning unified, spatially aware
representations that integrate cell morphology, gene expression, and spatial
context across biological scales. This requires models that can operate at
single-cell resolution, reason across spatial neighborhoods, and generalize to
whole-slide tissue organization. Here, we introduce SPATIA, a multi-scale
generative and predictive model for spatial transcriptomics. SPATIA learns
cell-level embeddings by fusing image-derived morphological tokens and
transcriptomic vector tokens using cross-attention and then aggregates them at
niche and tissue levels using transformer modules to capture spatial
dependencies. SPATIA incorporates token merging in its generative diffusion
decoder to synthesize high-resolution cell images conditioned on gene
expression. We assembled a multi-scale dataset consisting of 17 million
cell-gene pairs, 1 million niche-gene pairs, and 10,000 tissue-gene pairs
across 49 donors, 17 tissue types, and 12 disease states. We benchmark SPATIA
against 13 existing models across 12 individual tasks, which span several
categories including cell annotation, cell clustering, gene imputation,
cross-modal prediction, and image generation. SPATIA achieves improved
performance over all baselines and generates realistic cell morphologies that
reflect transcriptomic perturbations.

system allows user intent to modulate both visual outcomes and underlying

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 烹饪对日常生活独立性和幸福感至关重要，但对视力障碍者来说，由于缺乏进度跟踪和上下文反馈的支持，烹饪仍然具有挑战性。

Method: OSCAR整合了食谱解析、对象状态提取、视觉对齐与烹饪步骤的匹配以及时间因果建模，以支持实时步骤跟踪。

Result: 在173个教学视频和12个真实世界无视觉烹饪会话中，OSCAR显著提高了步骤预测的准确性，并揭示了影响性能的关键因素。

Conclusion: OSCAR为上下文感知辅助烹饪系统提供了技术管道、真实世界数据集和设计见解，推动了未来相关系统的发展。

Abstract: Cooking plays a vital role in everyday independence and well-being, yet
remains challenging for people with vision impairments due to limited support
for tracking progress and receiving contextual feedback. Object status - the
condition or transformation of ingredients and tools - offers a promising but
underexplored foundation for context-aware cooking support. In this paper, we
present OSCAR (Object Status Context Awareness for Recipes), a technical
pipeline that explores the use of object status recognition to enable recipe
progress tracking in non-visual cooking. OSCAR integrates recipe parsing,
object status extraction, visual alignment with cooking steps, and time-causal
modeling to support real-time step tracking. We evaluate OSCAR on 173
instructional videos and a real-world dataset of 12 non-visual cooking sessions
recorded by BLV individuals in their homes. Our results show that object status
consistently improves step prediction accuracy across vision-language models,
and reveal key factors that impact performance in real-world conditions, such
as implicit tasks, camera placement, and lighting. We contribute the pipeline
of context-aware recipe progress tracking, an annotated real-world non-visual
cooking dataset, and design insights to guide future context-aware assistive
cooking systems.

Motivation: 解决AI驱动的幻灯片生成工具缺乏动画支持，以及现有视觉语言模型在动画任务中因数据集缺失和时间推理能力不足而表现不佳的问题。

Method: 发布包含12,000组自然语言描述、动画JSON文件和渲染视频的数据集，并使用LoRA微调Qwen-2.5-VL-7B模型。

Result: LoRA模型在BLEU-4、ROUGE-L和CODA指标上显著提升，尤其在细节保真度方面表现突出。

Conclusion: 数据集、LoRA增强模型和CODA指标为未来基于VLM的动态幻灯片生成研究提供了基准和基础。

Abstract: Slide animations, such as fade-ins, fly-ins, and wipes, are critical for
audience engagement, efficient information delivery, and vivid visual
expression. However, most AI-driven slide-generation tools still lack native
animation support, and existing vision-language models (VLMs) struggle with
animation tasks due to the absence of public datasets and limited
temporal-reasoning capabilities. To address this gap, we release the first
public dataset for slide-animation modeling: 12,000 triplets of
natural-language descriptions, animation JSON files, and rendered videos,
collectively covering every built-in PowerPoint effect. Using this resource, we
fine-tune Qwen-2.5-VL-7B with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and achieve consistent
improvements over GPT-4.1 and Gemini-2.5-Pro in BLEU-4, ROUGE-L, SPICE, and our
Coverage-Order-Detail Assessment (CODA) metric, which evaluates action
coverage, temporal order, and detail fidelity. On a manually curated test set
of slides, the LoRA model increases BLEU-4 by around 60%, ROUGE-L by 30%, and
shows significant improvements in CODA-detail. This demonstrates that low-rank
adaptation enables reliable temporal reasoning and generalization beyond
synthetic data. Overall, our dataset, LoRA-enhanced model, and CODA metric
provide a rigorous benchmark and foundation for future research on VLM-based
dynamic slide generation.

Conclusion: CLUDI为高维数据聚类提供了一种新颖且强大的方法，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Diffusion models, widely recognized for their success in generative tasks,
have not yet been applied to clustering. We introduce Clustering via Diffusion
(CLUDI), a self-supervised framework that combines the generative power of
diffusion models with pre-trained Vision Transformer features to achieve robust
and accurate clustering. CLUDI is trained via a teacher-student paradigm: the
teacher uses stochastic diffusion-based sampling to produce diverse cluster
assignments, which the student refines into stable predictions. This
stochasticity acts as a novel data augmentation strategy, enabling CLUDI to
uncover intricate structures in high-dimensional data. Extensive evaluations on
challenging datasets demonstrate that CLUDI achieves state-of-the-art
performance in unsupervised classification, setting new benchmarks in
clustering robustness and adaptability to complex data distributions.

Motivation: 当前AI系统缺乏生物智能的核心特性，如快速持续学习、基于感知运动的表示和结构化知识。论文旨在通过模拟皮质柱架构缩小这一差距。

Method: 利用YCB数据集评估Monty在3D物体识别和姿态估计任务中的表现，包括感知运动学习、模型无关和基于模型的策略，以及模块化架构和投票算法。

Result: Monty展示了基于全局形状的分类能力、对称性检测能力，以及快速推理和高效学习的优势。

Conclusion: 千脑系统（如Monty）是一种有前景的AI新方法，尽管仍处于早期阶段，但其性能优于当前深度学习架构。

Abstract: Current AI systems achieve impressive performance on many tasks, yet they
lack core attributes of biological intelligence, including rapid, continual
learning, representations grounded in sensorimotor interactions, and structured
knowledge that enables efficient generalization. Neuroscience theory suggests
that mammals evolved flexible intelligence through the replication of a
semi-independent, sensorimotor module, a functional unit known as a cortical
column. To address the disparity between biological and artificial
intelligence, thousand-brains systems were proposed as a means of mirroring the
architecture of cortical columns and their interactions.
  In the current work, we evaluate the unique properties of Monty, the first
implementation of a thousand-brains system. We focus on 3D object perception,
and in particular, the combined task of object recognition and pose estimation.
Utilizing the YCB dataset of household objects, we first assess Monty's use of
sensorimotor learning to build structured representations, finding that these
enable robust generalization. These representations include an emphasis on
classifying objects by their global shape, as well as a natural ability to
detect object symmetries. We then explore Monty's use of model-free and
model-based policies to enable rapid inference by supporting principled
movements. We find that such policies complement Monty's modular architecture,
a design that can accommodate communication between modules to further
accelerate inference speed via a novel `voting' algorithm. Finally, we examine
Monty's use of associative, Hebbian-like binding to enable rapid, continual,
and computationally efficient learning, properties that compare favorably to
current deep learning architectures. While Monty is still in a nascent stage of
development, these findings support thousand-brains systems as a powerful and
promising new approach to AI.

Abstract: Furniture decoration is an important task in various industrial applications.
However, achieving a high-quality decorative result is often time-consuming and

how multi-agent systems can assist in automating the decoration process. We
propose FurniMAS, a multi-agent system for automatic furniture decoration.
Specifically, given a human prompt and a household furniture item such as a
working desk or a TV stand, our system suggests relevant assets with
appropriate styles and materials, and arranges them on the item, ensuring the
decorative result meets functionality, aesthetic, and ambiance preferences.
FurniMAS assembles a hybrid team of LLM-based and non-LLM agents, each
fulfilling distinct roles in a typical decoration project. These agents
collaborate through communication, logical reasoning, and validation to
transform the requirements into the final outcome. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our FurniMAS significantly outperforms other baselines in
generating high-quality 3D decor.

Motivation: 研究动机是比较IL和RL在手术动作规划中的表现，以探索哪种方法更适合实时辅助手术。

Method: 使用了双任务自回归模仿学习（DARIL）作为基线，并评估了三种RL变体：基于世界模型的RL、直接视频RL和逆RL增强。

Result: DARIL在动作三元组识别和下一帧预测中表现最佳（34.6%和33.6% mAP），而所有RL方法均表现不佳（最低3.1% mAP）。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了RL在序列决策中的优越性假设，为手术AI开发提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Surgical action planning requires predicting future instrument-verb-target
triplets for real-time assistance. While teleoperated robotic surgery provides
natural expert demonstrations for imitation learning (IL), reinforcement
learning (RL) could potentially discover superior strategies through
exploration. We present the first comprehensive comparison of IL versus RL for
surgical action planning on CholecT50. Our Dual-task Autoregressive Imitation
Learning (DARIL) baseline achieves 34.6% action triplet recognition mAP and
33.6% next frame prediction mAP with smooth planning degradation to 29.2% at
10-second horizons. We evaluated three RL variants: world model-based RL,
direct video RL, and inverse RL enhancement. Surprisingly, all RL approaches
underperformed DARIL i.e. world model RL dropped to 3.1% mAP at 10s while
direct video RL achieved only 15.9%. Our analysis reveals that distribution
matching on expert-annotated test sets systematically favors IL over
potentially valid RL policies that differ from training demonstrations. This
challenges assumptions about RL superiority in sequential decision making and
provides crucial insights for surgical AI development.

15.5-18.1% improvement on chest X-ray finding classification, and 10.8%
improvement on agentic evaluations compared to the base models. Fine-tuning
MedGemma further improves performance in subdomains, reducing errors in
electronic health record information retrieval by 50% and reaching comparable
performance to existing specialized state-of-the-art methods for pneumothorax
classification and histopathology patch classification. We additionally
introduce MedSigLIP, a medically-tuned vision encoder derived from SigLIP.
MedSigLIP powers the visual understanding capabilities of MedGemma and as an
encoder achieves comparable or better performance than specialized medical
image encoders. Taken together, the MedGemma collection provides a strong
foundation of medical image and text capabilities, with potential to
significantly accelerate medical research and development of downstream
applications. The MedGemma collection, including tutorials and model weights,

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 论文介绍了针对DCASE2025任务3挑战赛的音频和音视频系统，通过结合预训练语言对齐模型和改进的Conformer模块，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统SELD架构因多通道输入限制而无法充分利用大规模预训练的问题，通过引入语义信息提升模型表现。

Method: 整合CLAP（音频）和OWL-ViT（视觉）预训练模型，设计Cross-Modal Conformer模块，并采用自相关声学特征和左右声道交换增强数据。

Result: 音频和音视频系统在开发集上显著超越基线，模型集成和视觉后处理进一步提升了性能。

Abstract: This report presents our systems submitted to the audio-only and audio-visual
tracks of the DCASE2025 Task 3 Challenge: Stereo Sound Event Localization and
Detection (SELD) in Regular Video Content. SELD is a complex task that combines
temporal event classification with spatial localization, requiring reasoning
across spatial, temporal, and semantic dimensions. The last is arguably the
most challenging to model. Traditional SELD architectures rely on multichannel
input, which limits their ability to leverage large-scale pre-training due to
data constraints. To address this, we enhance standard SELD architectures with
semantic information by integrating pre-trained, contrastive language-aligned
models: CLAP for audio and OWL-ViT for visual inputs. These embeddings are
incorporated into a modified Conformer module tailored for multimodal fusion,
which we refer to as the Cross-Modal Conformer. Additionally, we incorporate
autocorrelation-based acoustic features to improve distance estimation. We
pre-train our models on curated synthetic audio and audio-visual datasets and
apply a left-right channel swapping augmentation to further increase the
training data. Both our audio-only and audio-visual systems substantially
outperform the challenge baselines on the development set, demonstrating the
effectiveness of our strategy. Performance is further improved through model
ensembling and a visual post-processing step based on human keypoints. Future
work will investigate the contribution of each modality and explore
architectural variants to further enhance results.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合人类手势模型和可微分渲染技术的方法，用于生成机器人绘画的自然轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具忽略了人类绘画/书写行为的物理特性，影响了视觉效果和艺术家-机器人协作的直观性。

Method: 使用sigma-lognormal模型描述人类手/臂运动，并与可微分矢量图形渲染器结合，通过梯度优化生成自然运动轨迹。

Result: 展示了生成可行机器人轨迹的能力，并应用于合成涂鸦和图像抽象任务。

Conclusion: 该方法成功结合了人类运动特性和图像驱动目标，提升了机器人绘画的自然性和协作潜力。

Abstract: Large image generation and vision models, combined with differentiable
rendering technologies, have become powerful tools for generating paths that
can be drawn or painted by a robot. However, these tools often overlook the
intrinsic physicality of the human drawing/writing act, which is usually
executed with skillful hand/arm gestures. Taking this into account is important
for the visual aesthetics of the results and for the development of closer and
more intuitive artist-robot collaboration scenarios. We present a method that
bridges this gap by enabling gradient-based optimization of natural human-like
motions guided by cost functions defined in image space. To this end, we use
the sigma-lognormal model of human hand/arm movements, with an adaptation that
enables its use in conjunction with a differentiable vector graphics (DiffVG)
renderer. We demonstrate how this pipeline can be used to generate feasible
trajectories for a robot by combining image-driven objectives with a
minimum-time smoothing criterion. We demonstrate applications with generation
and robotic reproduction of synthetic graffiti as well as image abstraction.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: AutoLayout是一种自动生成布局的方法，通过双系统框架和自验证机制解决现有方法的空间幻觉问题，显著提升了物理合理性和语义一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有布局生成方法存在空间幻觉问题，如物体漂浮、重叠或堆叠关系错位，难以平衡语义保真度和物理合理性。

Method: AutoLayout采用双系统框架：慢系统通过RRG管道提取对象属性和空间约束，快系统生成离散坐标和拓扑关系集，并通过LLM自适应关系库（ARL）进行验证。

Result: 在8种场景中，AutoLayout在物理合理性、语义一致性和功能完整性方面比SOTA方法提升了10.1%。

Conclusion: AutoLayout通过慢-快协作推理和自验证机制，有效解决了空间幻觉问题，实现了物理稳定性和语义一致性的平衡。

Abstract: The automated generation of layouts is vital for embodied intelligence and
autonomous systems, supporting applications from virtual environment
construction to home robot deployment. Current approaches, however, suffer from
spatial hallucination and struggle with balancing semantic fidelity and
physical plausibility, often producing layouts with deficits such as floating
or overlapping objects and misaligned stacking relation. In this paper, we
propose AutoLayout, a fully automated method that integrates a closed-loop
self-validation process within a dual-system framework. Specifically, a slow
system harnesses detailed reasoning with a Reasoning-Reflection-Generation
(RRG) pipeline to extract object attributes and spatial constraints. Then, a
fast system generates discrete coordinate sets and a topological relation set
that are jointly validated. To mitigate the limitations of handcrafted rules,
we further introduce an LLM-based Adaptive Relation Library (ARL) for
generating and evaluating layouts. Through the implementation of Slow-Fast
Collaborative Reasoning, the AutoLayout efficiently generates layouts after
thorough deliberation, effectively mitigating spatial hallucination. Its
self-validation mechanism establishes a closed-loop process that iteratively
corrects potential errors, achieving a balance between physical stability and
semantic consistency. The effectiveness of AutoLayout was validated across 8
distinct scenarios, where it demonstrated a significant 10.1% improvement over
SOTA methods in terms of physical plausibility, semantic consistency, and
functional completeness.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为IMMP的新方法，通过合并不同域的参数检查点来解决运动规划中的域适应问题，优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轨迹数据集在目标域中难以有效利用，传统方法存在域不平衡、灾难性遗忘和高计算成本等问题。

Method: IMMP采用两步流程：预合并捕获源域行为与交互，合并构建可适应目标域的模型。

Result: 在多个规划基准和模型上评估，表现优于传统方法。

Conclusion: IMMP能高效转移多样交互至目标域，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Motion planning is a crucial component of autonomous robot driving. While
various trajectory datasets exist, effectively utilizing them for a target
domain remains challenging due to differences in agent interactions and
environmental characteristics. Conventional approaches, such as domain
adaptation or ensemble learning, leverage multiple source datasets but suffer
from domain imbalance, catastrophic forgetting, and high computational costs.
To address these challenges, we propose Interaction-Merged Motion Planning
(IMMP), a novel approach that leverages parameter checkpoints trained on
different domains during adaptation to the target domain. IMMP follows a
two-step process: pre-merging to capture agent behaviors and interactions,
sufficiently extracting diverse information from the source domain, followed by
merging to construct an adaptable model that efficiently transfers diverse
interactions to the target domain. Our method is evaluated on various planning
benchmarks and models, demonstrating superior performance compared to
conventional approaches.

Motivation: 解决商用扫地机器人视觉监控部署复杂的问题，提出无需硬件修改的解决方案。

Method: 在机器人上安装带IMU的智能手机，利用神经惯性导航估计位姿，采用RAE方法缓解域差距，并通过清扫模式优化闭环检测。

Result: 在零售环境中，机器人定位相对位姿误差为0.83米，100多个物品的对象映射位置误差为0.97米。

Conclusion: Piggyback Camera系统提供了一种简单有效的视觉监控方案，适用于商用扫地机器人。

Abstract: This paper presents Piggyback Camera, an easy-to-deploy system for visual
surveillance using commercial robot vacuums. Rather than requiring access to
internal robot systems, our approach mounts a smartphone equipped with a camera
and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) on the robot, making it applicable to any
commercial robot without hardware modifications. The system estimates robot
poses through neural inertial navigation and efficiently captures images at
regular spatial intervals throughout the cleaning task. We develop a novel
test-time data augmentation method called Rotation-Augmented Ensemble (RAE) to
mitigate domain gaps in neural inertial navigation. A loop closure method that
exploits robot cleaning patterns further refines these estimated poses. We
demonstrate the system with an object mapping application that analyzes
captured images to geo-localize objects in the environment. Experimental
evaluation in retail environments shows that our approach achieves 0.83 m
relative pose error for robot localization and 0.97 m positional error for
object mapping of over 100 items.

Conclusion: EmbodieDreamer有效缩小Real2Sim2Real差距，提升机器人策略在真实世界的表现。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Embodied AI has led to an increasing demand for
large-scale, high-quality real-world data. However, collecting such embodied
data remains costly and inefficient. As a result, simulation environments have
become a crucial surrogate for training robot policies. Yet, the significant
Real2Sim2Real gap remains a critical bottleneck, particularly in terms of
physical dynamics and visual appearance. To address this challenge, we propose
EmbodieDreamer, a novel framework that reduces the Real2Sim2Real gap from both
the physics and appearance perspectives. Specifically, we propose PhysAligner,
a differentiable physics module designed to reduce the Real2Sim physical gap.
It jointly optimizes robot-specific parameters such as control gains and
friction coefficients to better align simulated dynamics with real-world
observations. In addition, we introduce VisAligner, which incorporates a
conditional video diffusion model to bridge the Sim2Real appearance gap by
translating low-fidelity simulated renderings into photorealistic videos
conditioned on simulation states, enabling high-fidelity visual transfer.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of EmbodieDreamer. The
proposed PhysAligner reduces physical parameter estimation error by 3.74%
compared to simulated annealing methods while improving optimization speed by
89.91\%. Moreover, training robot policies in the generated photorealistic
environment leads to a 29.17% improvement in the average task success rate
across real-world tasks after reinforcement learning. Code, model and data will
be publicly available.

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems have made significant advances in Q&A, perception,
prediction, and planning based on local visual information, yet they struggle
to incorporate broader navigational context that human drivers routinely
utilize. We address this critical gap between local sensor data and global
navigation information by proposing NavigScene, an auxiliary navigation-guided
natural language dataset that simulates a human-like driving environment within
autonomous driving systems. Moreover, we develop three complementary paradigms
to leverage NavigScene: (1) Navigation-guided Reasoning, which enhances
vision-language models by incorporating navigation context into the prompting
approach; (2) Navigation-guided Preference Optimization, a reinforcement
learning method that extends Direct Preference Optimization to improve
vision-language model responses by establishing preferences for
navigation-relevant summarized information; and (3) Navigation-guided
Vision-Language-Action model, which integrates navigation guidance and
vision-language models with conventional driving models through feature fusion.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approaches significantly improve
performance across perception, prediction, planning, and question-answering
tasks by enabling reasoning capabilities beyond visual range and improving
generalization to diverse driving scenarios. This work represents a significant
step toward more comprehensive autonomous driving systems capable of navigating
complex, unfamiliar environments with greater reliability and safety.

Motivation: 解决现有基于视频大语言模型的视觉与语言导航方法在细粒度视觉理解、长期上下文建模和计算效率之间的权衡问题。

Conclusion: StreamVLN在现实世界部署中表现出鲁棒性和高效性，支持长视频流和有限上下文大小。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) in real-world settings requires agents
to process continuous visual streams and generate actions with low latency
grounded in language instructions. While Video-based Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs) have driven recent progress, current VLN methods based on
Video-LLM often face trade-offs among fine-grained visual understanding,
long-term context modeling and computational efficiency. We introduce
StreamVLN, a streaming VLN framework that employs a hybrid slow-fast context
modeling strategy to support multi-modal reasoning over interleaved vision,
language and action inputs. The fast-streaming dialogue context facilitates
responsive action generation through a sliding-window of active dialogues,
while the slow-updating memory context compresses historical visual states
using a 3D-aware token pruning strategy. With this slow-fast design, StreamVLN
achieves coherent multi-turn dialogue through efficient KV cache reuse,
supporting long video streams with bounded context size and inference cost.
Experiments on VLN-CE benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with
stable low latency, ensuring robustness and efficiency in real-world
deployment. The project page is:

Abstract: Ray tracing is a widely used deterministic method for radio propagation
simulations, capable of producing physically accurate multipath components. The
accuracy depends on the quality of the environment model and its
electromagnetic properties. Recent advances in computer vision and machine
learning have made it possible to reconstruct detailed environment models
augmented with semantic segmentation labels.
  In this letter, we propose a differentiable ray tracing-based radio
propagation simulator that operates directly on point clouds. We showcase the
efficiency of our method by simulating multi-bounce propagation paths with up
to five interactions with specular reflections and diffuse scattering in two
indoor scenarios, each completing in less than 90 ms. Lastly, we demonstrate
how the differentiability of electromagnetic computations can be combined with
segmentation labels to learn the electromagnetic properties of the environment.

TL;DR: LVM4CSI利用计算机视觉预训练模型处理无线通信中的CSI任务，无需微调，性能优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有AI方法依赖任务特定神经网络和大量数据的问题，提高通用性和实用性。

Method: 将CSI任务映射为计算机视觉任务，转换CSI为视觉格式，结合轻量可训练层。

Result: 在信道估计、活动识别和定位任务中表现优异，参数更少，无需特定设计。

Conclusion: LVM4CSI为无线通信提供了一种高效通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate channel state information (CSI) is critical to the performance of
wireless communication systems, especially with the increasing scale and
complexity introduced by 5G and future 6G technologies. While artificial
intelligence (AI) offers a promising approach to CSI acquisition and
utilization, existing methods largely depend on task-specific neural networks
(NNs) that require expert-driven design and large training datasets, limiting
their generalizability and practicality. To address these challenges, we
propose LVM4CSI, a general and efficient framework that leverages the
structural similarity between CSI and computer vision (CV) data to directly
apply large vision models (LVMs) pre-trained on extensive CV datasets to
wireless tasks without any fine-tuning, in contrast to large language
model-based methods that generally necessitate fine-tuning. LVM4CSI maps CSI
tasks to analogous CV tasks, transforms complex-valued CSI into visual formats
compatible with LVMs, and integrates lightweight trainable layers to adapt
extracted features to specific communication objectives. We validate LVM4CSI
through three representative case studies, including channel estimation, human
activity recognition, and user localization. Results demonstrate that LVM4CSI
achieves comparable or superior performance to task-specific NNs, including an
improvement exceeding 9.61 dB in channel estimation and approximately 40%
reduction in localization error. Furthermore, it significantly reduces the
number of trainable parameters and eliminates the need for task-specific NN
design.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SESLR的在线持续学习方法，通过结合睡眠增强的潜在重放方案和脉冲神经网络（SNNs），显著降低了内存开销并缓解了对新任务的分类偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘计算场景需要硬件高效的在线持续学习算法以适应动态环境，但现有算法存在高内存开销和对新任务的偏差问题。

Method: SESLR利用SNNs的二进制脉冲特性将重放特征存储为单比特，并通过噪声增强的睡眠阶段训练模型以缓解偏差。

Result: 在Split CIFAR10上，SESLR的平均准确率提高了近30%，内存消耗仅为基线方法的三分之一；在Split CIFAR10-DVS上，准确率提高了约10%，内存开销减少了32倍。

Conclusion: SESLR是资源受限的边缘计算场景中在线持续学习的一种有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Edge computing scenarios necessitate the development of hardware-efficient
online continual learning algorithms to be adaptive to dynamic environment.
However, existing algorithms always suffer from high memory overhead and bias
towards recently trained tasks. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a
novel online continual learning approach termed as SESLR, which incorporates a
sleep enhanced latent replay scheme with spiking neural networks (SNNs). SESLR
leverages SNNs' binary spike characteristics to store replay features in single
bits, significantly reducing memory overhead. Furthermore, inspired by
biological sleep-wake cycles, SESLR introduces a noise-enhanced sleep phase
where the model exclusively trains on replay samples with controlled noise
injection, effectively mitigating classification bias towards new classes.
Extensive experiments on both conventional (MNIST, CIFAR10) and neuromorphic
(NMNIST, CIFAR10-DVS) datasets demonstrate SESLR's effectiveness. On Split
CIFAR10, SESLR achieves nearly 30% improvement in average accuracy with only
one-third of the memory consumption compared to baseline methods. On Split
CIFAR10-DVS, it improves accuracy by approximately 10% while reducing memory
overhead by a factor of 32. These results validate SESLR as a promising
solution for online continual learning in resource-constrained edge computing
scenarios.
