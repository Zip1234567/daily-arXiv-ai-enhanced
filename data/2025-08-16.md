### [1] [Puppeteer: Rig and Animate Your 3D Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10898)
*Chaoyue Song,Xiu Li,Fan Yang,Zhongcong Xu,Jiacheng Wei,Fayao Liu,Jiashi Feng,Guosheng Lin,Jianfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Puppeteer是一个自动化3D模型绑定和动画生成的框架，通过预测骨骼结构和皮肤权重，结合优化动画管道，显著优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决静态3D模型动态化过程中依赖专家干预的瓶颈问题。

Method: 使用自回归变换器预测骨骼结构，注意力架构推断皮肤权重，并结合可微分优化动画管道。

Result: 在骨骼预测精度和皮肤权重质量上显著优于现有方法，处理多样3D内容且动画稳定。

Conclusion: Puppeteer为动态3D内容生成提供了高效、高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Modern interactive applications increasingly demand dynamic 3D content, yet
the transformation of static 3D models into animated assets constitutes a
significant bottleneck in content creation pipelines. While recent advances in
generative AI have revolutionized static 3D model creation, rigging and
animation continue to depend heavily on expert intervention. We present
Puppeteer, a comprehensive framework that addresses both automatic rigging and
animation for diverse 3D objects. Our system first predicts plausible skeletal
structures via an auto-regressive transformer that introduces a joint-based
tokenization strategy for compact representation and a hierarchical ordering
methodology with stochastic perturbation that enhances bidirectional learning
capabilities. It then infers skinning weights via an attention-based
architecture incorporating topology-aware joint attention that explicitly
encodes inter-joint relationships based on skeletal graph distances. Finally,
we complement these rigging advances with a differentiable optimization-based
animation pipeline that generates stable, high-fidelity animations while being
computationally more efficient than existing approaches. Extensive evaluations
across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in both skeletal prediction accuracy
and skinning quality. The system robustly processes diverse 3D content, ranging
from professionally designed game assets to AI-generated shapes, producing
temporally coherent animations that eliminate the jittering issues common in
existing methods.

### [2] [Stochastic-based Patch Filtering for Few-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10066)
*Javier Rodenas,Eduardo Aguilar,Petia Radeva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于随机性补丁过滤的少样本学习方法（SPFF），通过过滤与类别表示相关性较低的补丁嵌入，提升食物图像的分类准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 食物图像因视觉复杂性和多样性导致少样本学习模型难以聚焦关键元素，易产生误分类。

Method: SPFF通过随机过滤补丁嵌入，保留与类别表示相关性高的补丁，并利用相似性矩阵量化查询图像与支持图像的关系。

Result: 在Food-101、VireoFood-172和UECFood-256基准测试中，SPFF优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SPFF能有效聚焦食物类别特征，过滤无关补丁，提升少样本分类性能。

Abstract: Food images present unique challenges for few-shot learning models due to
their visual complexity and variability. For instance, a pasta dish might
appear with various garnishes on different plates and in diverse lighting
conditions and camera perspectives. This problem leads to losing focus on the
most important elements when comparing the query with support images, resulting
in misclassification. To address this issue, we propose Stochastic-based Patch
Filtering for Few-Shot Learning (SPFF) to attend to the patch embeddings that
show greater correlation with the class representation. The key concept of SPFF
involves the stochastic filtering of patch embeddings, where patches less
similar to the class-aware embedding are more likely to be discarded. With
patch embedding filtered according to the probability of appearance, we use a
similarity matrix that quantifies the relationship between the query image and
its respective support images. Through a qualitative analysis, we demonstrate
that SPFF effectively focuses on patches where class-specific food features are
most prominent while successfully filtering out non-relevant patches. We
validate our approach through extensive experiments on few-shot classification
benchmarks: Food-101, VireoFood-172 and UECFood-256, outperforming the existing
SoA methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DINOv3是一种自监督学习模型，通过数据扩展、Gram anchoring方法和后处理策略，实现了在多种视觉任务上的卓越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 消除手动数据标注的需求，使模型能够从多样化数据中学习通用视觉表示。

Method: 结合数据扩展和模型规模优化，引入Gram anchoring解决特征退化问题，并应用后处理策略增强模型灵活性。

Result: DINOv3在多种视觉任务上表现优异，超越了现有的自监督和弱监督基础模型。

Conclusion: DINOv3为视觉基础模型提供了可扩展的解决方案，适用于多样化的任务和资源约束。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning holds the promise of eliminating the need for manual
data annotation, enabling models to scale effortlessly to massive datasets and
larger architectures. By not being tailored to specific tasks or domains, this
training paradigm has the potential to learn visual representations from
diverse sources, ranging from natural to aerial images -- using a single
algorithm. This technical report introduces DINOv3, a major milestone toward
realizing this vision by leveraging simple yet effective strategies. First, we
leverage the benefit of scaling both dataset and model size by careful data
preparation, design, and optimization. Second, we introduce a new method called
Gram anchoring, which effectively addresses the known yet unsolved issue of
dense feature maps degrading during long training schedules. Finally, we apply
post-hoc strategies that further enhance our models' flexibility with respect
to resolution, model size, and alignment with text. As a result, we present a
versatile vision foundation model that outperforms the specialized state of the
art across a broad range of settings, without fine-tuning. DINOv3 produces
high-quality dense features that achieve outstanding performance on various
vision tasks, significantly surpassing previous self- and weakly-supervised
foundation models. We also share the DINOv3 suite of vision models, designed to
advance the state of the art on a wide spectrum of tasks and data by providing
scalable solutions for diverse resource constraints and deployment scenarios.

### [4] [Empowering Morphing Attack Detection using Interpretable Image-Text Foundation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10110)
*Sushrut Patwardhan,Raghavendra Ramachandra,Sushma Venkatesh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多模态学习方法，用于生成变形攻击检测的文本描述，并通过零样本评估验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 变形攻击检测是确保人脸识别系统可靠性的重要组成部分，本文旨在提供一种可解释的文本描述方法。

Method: 使用对比语言-图像预训练（CLIP）进行零样本评估，设计了十种文本提示，并结合预训练神经网络进行实验。

Result: 实验表明，该方法不仅能检测变形攻击，还能预测最相关的文本片段，并在多种变形生成技术上表现优异。

Conclusion: 多模态学习方法在变形攻击检测中具有潜力，尤其是零样本评估的通用性和可解释性。

Abstract: Morphing attack detection has become an essential component of face
recognition systems for ensuring a reliable verification scenario. In this
paper, we present a multimodal learning approach that can provide a textual
description of morphing attack detection. We first show that zero-shot
evaluation of the proposed framework using Contrastive Language-Image
Pretraining (CLIP) can yield not only generalizable morphing attack detection,
but also predict the most relevant text snippet. We present an extensive
analysis of ten different textual prompts that include both short and long
textual prompts. These prompts are engineered by considering the human
understandable textual snippet. Extensive experiments were performed on a face
morphing dataset that was developed using a publicly available face biometric
dataset. We present an evaluation of SOTA pre-trained neural networks together
with the proposed framework in the zero-shot evaluation of five different
morphing generation techniques that are captured in three different mediums.

### [5] [Interpretable Oracle Bone Script Decipherment through Radical and Pictographic Analysis with LVLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10113)
*Kaixin Peng,Mengyang Zhao,Haiyang Yu,Teng Fu,Bin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大型视觉语言模型的可解释甲骨文破译方法，结合部首分析和象形语义理解，显著提升了零样本破译性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 甲骨文因其稀有性、抽象性和象形多样性，破译难度大。现有深度学习方法忽视了字形与语义的复杂联系，导致泛化能力和可解释性不足。

Method: 采用渐进式训练策略，从部首识别到象形分析，设计了部首-象形双匹配机制，并构建了包含47,157个汉字的象形破译数据集。

Result: 在公开基准测试中取得了Top-10准确率的领先水平，零样本破译能力优异，并提供逻辑分析过程。

Conclusion: 该方法为未破译甲骨文提供了考古学参考，具有数字人文和历史研究的应用潜力。

Abstract: As the oldest mature writing system, Oracle Bone Script (OBS) has long posed
significant challenges for archaeological decipherment due to its rarity,
abstractness, and pictographic diversity. Current deep learning-based methods
have made exciting progress on the OBS decipherment task, but existing
approaches often ignore the intricate connections between glyphs and the
semantics of OBS. This results in limited generalization and interpretability,
especially when addressing zero-shot settings and undeciphered OBS. To this
end, we propose an interpretable OBS decipherment method based on Large
Vision-Language Models, which synergistically combines radical analysis and
pictograph-semantic understanding to bridge the gap between glyphs and meanings
of OBS. Specifically, we propose a progressive training strategy that guides
the model from radical recognition and analysis to pictographic analysis and
mutual analysis, thus enabling reasoning from glyph to meaning. We also design
a Radical-Pictographic Dual Matching mechanism informed by the analysis
results, significantly enhancing the model's zero-shot decipherment
performance. To facilitate model training, we propose the Pictographic
Decipherment OBS Dataset, which comprises 47,157 Chinese characters annotated
with OBS images and pictographic analysis texts. Experimental results on public
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art Top-10
accuracy and superior zero-shot decipherment capabilities. More importantly,
our model delivers logical analysis processes, possibly providing
archaeologically valuable reference results for undeciphered OBS, and thus has
potential applications in digital humanities and historical research. The
dataset and code will be released in https://github.com/PKXX1943/PD-OBS.

*Arianna Bunnell,Devon Cataldi,Yannik Glaser,Thomas K. Wolfgruber,Steven Heymsfield,Alan B. Zonderman,Thomas L. Kelly,Peter Sadowski,John A. Shepherd*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发了一种基于深度学习的自动标记方法，用于全身双能X射线吸收测量（TBDXA）扫描，并在外部测试数据集中达到99.5%的关键点正确率。该方法用于形状和外观建模（SAM），并与健康标志物关联分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TBDXA是一种低成本全身成像技术，广泛用于身体成分评估，但缺乏自动标记方法。

Method: 使用1,683个手动标注的TBDXA扫描训练深度学习模型，自动放置关键点。

Result: 在外部测试数据集中达到99.5%的关键点正确率，并成功关联健康标志物。

Conclusion: 该方法为身体成分和形状与健康标志物的关系提供了新证据和假设，并开源了相关工具。

Abstract: Total-body dual X-ray absorptiometry (TBDXA) imaging is a relatively low-cost
whole-body imaging modality, widely used for body composition assessment. We
develop and validate a deep learning method for automatic fiducial point
placement on TBDXA scans using 1,683 manually-annotated TBDXA scans. The method
achieves 99.5% percentage correct keypoints in an external testing dataset. To
demonstrate the value for shape and appearance modeling (SAM), our method is
used to place keypoints on 35,928 scans for five different TBDXA imaging modes,
then associations with health markers are tested in two cohorts not used for
SAM model generation using two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. SAM feature
distributions associated with health biomarkers are shown to corroborate
existing evidence and generate new hypotheses on body composition and shape's
relationship to various frailty, metabolic, inflammation, and cardiometabolic
health markers. Evaluation scripts, model weights, automatic point file
generation code, and triangulation files are available at

### [7] [MANGO: Multimodal Attention-based Normalizing Flow Approach to Fusion Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10133)
*Thanh-Dat Truong,Christophe Bobda,Nitin Agarwal,Khoa Luu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型多模态注意力归一化流（MANGO）方法，通过可逆交叉注意力层（ICA）和三种新的交叉注意力机制，实现显式、可解释的多模态融合学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态融合方法依赖Transformer的注意力机制隐式学习特征相关性，难以捕捉模态本质特征和复杂结构。

Method: 提出可逆交叉注意力层（ICA）和三种新交叉注意力机制（MMCA、IMCA、LICA），并设计多模态注意力归一化流以处理高维数据。

Result: 在语义分割、图像到图像翻译和电影类型分类任务中取得最先进性能。

Conclusion: MANGO方法显式建模多模态特征相关性，性能优越且可扩展。

Abstract: Multimodal learning has gained much success in recent years. However, current
multimodal fusion methods adopt the attention mechanism of Transformers to
implicitly learn the underlying correlation of multimodal features. As a
result, the multimodal model cannot capture the essential features of each
modality, making it difficult to comprehend complex structures and correlations
of multimodal inputs. This paper introduces a novel Multimodal Attention-based
Normalizing Flow (MANGO) approach\footnote{The source code of this work will be
publicly available.} to developing explicit, interpretable, and tractable
multimodal fusion learning. In particular, we propose a new Invertible
Cross-Attention (ICA) layer to develop the Normalizing Flow-based Model for
multimodal data. To efficiently capture the complex, underlying correlations in
multimodal data in our proposed invertible cross-attention layer, we propose
three new cross-attention mechanisms: Modality-to-Modality Cross-Attention
(MMCA), Inter-Modality Cross-Attention (IMCA), and Learnable Inter-Modality
Cross-Attention (LICA). Finally, we introduce a new Multimodal Attention-based
Normalizing Flow to enable the scalability of our proposed method to
high-dimensional multimodal data. Our experimental results on three different
multimodal learning tasks, i.e., semantic segmentation, image-to-image
translation, and movie genre classification, have illustrated the
state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance of the proposed approach.

### [8] [Improving watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) disease classification with generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)-based synthetic and real-field images via a custom EfficientNetV2-L model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10156)
*Nitin Rai,Nathan S. Boyd,Gary E. Vallad,Arnold W. Schumann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究探讨了结合少量真实图像与合成图像是否能提升西瓜病害分类模型的性能，发现混合使用显著提高了模型表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估生成式AI模型在农业病害诊断中的有效性，减少对资源密集型实地数据收集的依赖。

Method: 使用EfficientNetV2-L模型，比较五种不同训练数据集（纯真实图像、纯合成图像及不同比例混合）的效果。

Result: 混合真实与合成图像的训练集（H3-H4）显著提升了模型的精确度、召回率和F1分数。

Conclusion: 合成图像不能完全替代真实图像，混合使用可最大化模型性能。

Abstract: The current advancements in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) models
have paved the way for new possibilities for generating high-resolution
synthetic images, thereby offering a promising alternative to traditional image
acquisition for training computer vision models in agriculture. In the context
of crop disease diagnosis, GenAI models are being used to create synthetic
images of various diseases, potentially facilitating model creation and
reducing the dependency on resource-intensive in-field data collection.
However, limited research has been conducted on evaluating the effectiveness of
integrating real with synthetic images to improve disease classification
performance. Therefore, this study aims to investigate whether combining a
limited number of real images with synthetic images can enhance the prediction
accuracy of an EfficientNetV2-L model for classifying watermelon
\textit{(Citrullus lanatus)} diseases. The training dataset was divided into
five treatments: H0 (only real images), H1 (only synthetic images), H2 (1:1
real-to-synthetic), H3 (1:10 real-to-synthetic), and H4 (H3 + random images to
improve variability and model generalization). All treatments were trained
using a custom EfficientNetV2-L architecture with enhanced fine-tuning and
transfer learning techniques. Models trained on H2, H3, and H4 treatments
demonstrated high precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. Additionally, the
weighted F1-score increased from 0.65 (on H0) to 1.00 (on H3-H4) signifying
that the addition of a small number of real images with a considerable volume
of synthetic images improved model performance and generalizability. Overall,
this validates the findings that synthetic images alone cannot adequately
substitute for real images; instead, both must be used in a hybrid manner to
maximize model performance for crop disease classification.

### [9] [SynSpill: Improved Industrial Spill Detection With Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10171)
*Aaditya Baranwal,Abdul Mueez,Jason Voelker,Guneet Bhatia,Shruti Vyas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于合成数据的框架，用于提升视觉语言模型（VLMs）在工业泄漏检测等安全关键领域的性能，弥补真实数据稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于隐私、数据敏感性和事件罕见性，工业泄漏检测等领域缺乏足够的真实数据，导致传统微调方法效果不佳。

Method: 通过高质量合成数据生成管道，结合参数高效微调（PEFT）技术，提升VLMs和目标检测器（如YOLO和DETR）的性能。

Result: 合成数据（SynSpill数据集）显著提升了VLMs和检测器的性能，使其在未见泄漏场景中表现接近。

Conclusion: 高保真合成数据是解决安全关键领域数据稀缺问题的有效手段，结合轻量级适配方法，为工业环境中的视觉系统部署提供了经济高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have transformed general-purpose
visual recognition through strong zero-shot capabilities. However, their
performance degrades significantly in niche, safety-critical domains such as
industrial spill detection, where hazardous events are rare, sensitive, and
difficult to annotate. This scarcity -- driven by privacy concerns, data
sensitivity, and the infrequency of real incidents -- renders conventional
fine-tuning of detectors infeasible for most industrial settings.
  We address this challenge by introducing a scalable framework centered on a
high-quality synthetic data generation pipeline. We demonstrate that this
synthetic corpus enables effective Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of
VLMs and substantially boosts the performance of state-of-the-art object
detectors such as YOLO and DETR. Notably, in the absence of synthetic data
(SynSpill dataset), VLMs still generalize better to unseen spill scenarios than
these detectors. When SynSpill is used, both VLMs and detectors achieve marked
improvements, with their performance becoming comparable.
  Our results underscore that high-fidelity synthetic data is a powerful means
to bridge the domain gap in safety-critical applications. The combination of
synthetic generation and lightweight adaptation offers a cost-effective,
scalable pathway for deploying vision systems in industrial environments where
real data is scarce/impractical to obtain.

### [10] [EntropyGS: An Efficient Entropy Coding on 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10227)
*Yuning Huang,Jiahao Pang,Fengqing Zhu,Dong Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）是一种新兴的视图合成方法，具有快速训练/渲染和高质量视觉效果的优点。本文提出了一种名为EntropyGS的因子化和参数化熵编码方法，用于压缩3DGS高斯属性，实现了约30倍的码率降低，同时保持相似的渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS的高斯创建和视图渲染任务通常在不同时间或设备上分离，因此需要存储/传输和压缩3DGS高斯属性。本文通过分析高斯属性的相关性和统计特性，发现了一些规律，为压缩提供了理论基础。

Method: 本文首先分析了3DGS高斯属性的相关性和统计特性，发现球谐AC属性遵循拉普拉斯分布，而旋转、缩放和不透明度可以用高斯混合模型近似。基于这些发现，提出了一种因子化和参数化的熵编码方法EntropyGS，在编码时估计每个高斯属性的分布参数以辅助熵编码，并根据属性类型自适应地进行量化。

Result: EntropyGS在基准数据集上实现了约30倍的码率降低，同时保持了与输入3DGS数据相似的渲染质量，且编码和解码时间较短。

Conclusion: EntropyGS是一种高效的3DGS高斯属性压缩方法，通过利用高斯属性的统计特性和相关性，实现了显著的码率降低和快速的编码/解码性能。

Abstract: As an emerging novel view synthesis approach, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
demonstrates fast training/rendering with superior visual quality. The two
tasks of 3DGS, Gaussian creation and view rendering, are typically separated
over time or devices, and thus storage/transmission and finally compression of
3DGS Gaussians become necessary. We begin with a correlation and statistical
analysis of 3DGS Gaussian attributes. An inspiring finding in this work reveals
that spherical harmonic AC attributes precisely follow Laplace distributions,
while mixtures of Gaussian distributions can approximate rotation, scaling, and
opacity. Additionally, harmonic AC attributes manifest weak correlations with
other attributes except for inherited correlations from a color space. A
factorized and parameterized entropy coding method, EntropyGS, is hereinafter
proposed. During encoding, distribution parameters of each Gaussian attribute
are estimated to assist their entropy coding. The quantization for entropy
coding is adaptively performed according to Gaussian attribute types. EntropyGS
demonstrates about 30x rate reduction on benchmark datasets while maintaining
similar rendering quality compared to input 3DGS data, with a fast encoding and
decoding time.

Result: 在三种癌症类型中实现准确的细胞类型注释，并揭示不同的微环境生态位。

Conclusion: 展示了基础模型和多模态融合在解析复杂组织生态系统中的潜力。

Abstract: Xenium, a new spatial transcriptomics platform, enables
subcellular-resolution profiling of complex tumor tissues. Despite the rich
morphological information in histology images, extracting robust cell-level
features and integrating them with spatial transcriptomics data remains a
critical challenge. We introduce CellSymphony, a flexible multimodal framework
that leverages foundation model-derived embeddings from both Xenium
transcriptomic profiles and histology images at true single-cell resolution. By
learning joint representations that fuse spatial gene expression with
morphological context, CellSymphony achieves accurate cell type annotation and
uncovers distinct microenvironmental niches across three cancer types. This
work highlights the potential of foundation models and multimodal fusion for
deciphering the physiological and phenotypic orchestration of cells within
complex tissue ecosystems.

*Farid Tasharofi,Fuxin Fan,Melika Qahqaie,Mareike Thies,Andreas Maier*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FIND-Net是一种新型金属伪影减少（MAR）框架，结合频域和空间域处理，显著减少伪影并保留结构细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金属植入物在CT成像中产生的高密度伪影严重影响图像质量，现有深度学习方法难以同时抑制伪影和保留结构。

Method: FIND-Net整合快速傅里叶卷积（FFC）层和可训练高斯滤波，在频域和空间域中处理MAR任务。

Result: 在合成数据集上，FIND-Net在MAE、SSIM和PSNR指标上优于现有方法，且在真实临床CT扫描中表现优异。

Conclusion: FIND-Net在MAR任务中表现出色，具有更好的结构保留和临床适用性。

Abstract: Metal artifacts, caused by high-density metallic implants in computed
tomography (CT) imaging, severely degrade image quality, complicating diagnosis
and treatment planning. While existing deep learning algorithms have achieved
notable success in Metal Artifact Reduction (MAR), they often struggle to
suppress artifacts while preserving structural details. To address this
challenge, we propose FIND-Net (Fourier-Integrated Network with Dictionary
Kernels), a novel MAR framework that integrates frequency and spatial domain
processing to achieve superior artifact suppression and structural
preservation. FIND-Net incorporates Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC) layers and
trainable Gaussian filtering, treating MAR as a hybrid task operating in both
spatial and frequency domains. This approach enhances global contextual
understanding and frequency selectivity, effectively reducing artifacts while
maintaining anatomical structures. Experiments on synthetic datasets show that
FIND-Net achieves statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art
MAR methods, with a 3.07% MAE reduction, 0.18% SSIM increase, and 0.90% PSNR
improvement, confirming robustness across varying artifact complexities.
Furthermore, evaluations on real-world clinical CT scans confirm FIND-Net's
ability to minimize modifications to clean anatomical regions while effectively
suppressing metal-induced distortions. These findings highlight FIND-Net's
potential for advancing MAR performance, offering superior structural
preservation and improved clinical applicability. Code is available at

Abstract: Crack detection plays a crucial role in civil infrastructures, including
inspection of pavements, buildings, etc., and deep learning has significantly
advanced this field in recent years. While numerous technical and review papers
exist in this domain, emerging trends are reshaping the landscape. These shifts
include transitions in learning paradigms (from fully supervised learning to
semi-supervised, weakly-supervised, unsupervised, few-shot, domain adaptation
and fine-tuning foundation models), improvements in generalizability (from
single-dataset performance to cross-dataset evaluation), and diversification in
dataset reacquisition (from RGB images to specialized sensor-based data). In
this review, we systematically analyze these trends and highlight
representative works. Additionally, we introduce a new dataset collected with
3D laser scans, 3DCrack, to support future research and conduct extensive
benchmarking experiments to establish baselines for commonly used deep learning
methodologies, including recent foundation models. Our findings provide
insights into the evolving methodologies and future directions in deep
learning-based crack detection. Project page:

*Haonan Ge,Yiwei Wang,Ming-Hsuan Yang,Yujun Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的解码方法MRFD，通过多区域融合减少视觉语言模型的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型视觉语言模型在多模态任务中因视觉信息验证能力有限而产生的幻觉问题。

Method: MRFD利用交叉注意力识别显著区域，为每个区域生成初始响应，并通过Jensen-Shannon Divergence计算可靠性权重，实现一致性融合。

Result: 实验表明，MRFD显著减少幻觉并提高响应的事实性，且无需模型更新。

Conclusion: MRFD是一种有效的训练无关方法，能提升视觉语言模型的真实性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown strong performance across
multimodal tasks. However, they often produce hallucinations -- text that is
inconsistent with visual input, due to the limited ability to verify
information in different regions of the image. To address this, we propose
Multi-Region Fusion Decoding (MRFD), a training-free decoding method that
improves factual grounding by modeling inter-region consistency. MRFD
identifies salient regions using cross-attention, generates initial responses
for each, and computes reliability weights based on Jensen-Shannon Divergence
(JSD) among the responses. These weights guide a consistency-aware fusion of
per-region predictions, using region-aware prompts inspired by Chain-of-Thought
reasoning. Experiments across multiple LVLMs and benchmarks show that MRFD
significantly reduces hallucinations and improves response factuality without
requiring model updates.

*Yujie Zhao,Jiabei Zeng,Shiguang Shan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究探讨了如何通过动态校准策略提高基于外观的视线估计（PoG）对头部姿态变化的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PoG估计器因个体差异和头部姿态变化导致泛化能力不足，需改进校准策略以提高准确性。

Method: 构建MobilePoG基准，分析校准点和头部姿态多样性对估计精度的影响，提出动态校准策略。

Result: 实验表明，校准过程中引入更多头部姿态变化可提升估计器对姿态变化的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 动态校准策略能生成对头部姿态变化更不敏感的PoG估计器，优于传统方法。

Abstract: Although appearance-based point-of-gaze (PoG) estimation has improved, the
estimators still struggle to generalize across individuals due to personal
differences. Therefore, person-specific calibration is required for accurate
PoG estimation. However, calibrated PoG estimators are often sensitive to head
pose variations. To address this, we investigate the key factors influencing
calibrated estimators and explore pose-robust calibration strategies.
Specifically, we first construct a benchmark, MobilePoG, which includes facial
images from 32 individuals focusing on designated points under either fixed or
continuously changing head poses. Using this benchmark, we systematically
analyze how the diversity of calibration points and head poses influences
estimation accuracy. Our experiments show that introducing a wider range of
head poses during calibration improves the estimator's ability to handle pose
variation. Building on this insight, we propose a dynamic calibration strategy
in which users fixate on calibration points while moving their phones. This
strategy naturally introduces head pose variation during a user-friendly and
efficient calibration process, ultimately producing a better calibrated PoG
estimator that is less sensitive to head pose variations than those using
conventional calibration strategies. Codes and datasets are available at our
project page.

Method: 集成文本-图像对比学习模块和结构引导机制，通过联合优化对比损失、结构一致性损失和语义保留损失，实现多目标监督。

Conclusion: 该方法在不增加计算复杂度的情况下，显著提升了生成图像的语义清晰度和结构完整性，为文本-图像联合建模提供了可行技术路径。

Abstract: This paper addresses the performance bottlenecks of existing text-driven
image generation methods in terms of semantic alignment accuracy and structural
consistency. A high-fidelity image generation method is proposed by integrating
text-image contrastive constraints with structural guidance mechanisms. The
approach introduces a contrastive learning module that builds strong
cross-modal alignment constraints to improve semantic matching between text and
image. At the same time, structural priors such as semantic layout maps or edge
sketches are used to guide the generator in spatial-level structural modeling.
This enhances the layout completeness and detail fidelity of the generated
images. Within the overall framework, the model jointly optimizes contrastive
loss, structural consistency loss, and semantic preservation loss. A
multi-objective supervision mechanism is adopted to improve the semantic
consistency and controllability of the generated content. Systematic
experiments are conducted on the COCO-2014 dataset. Sensitivity analyses are
performed on embedding dimensions, text length, and structural guidance
strength. Quantitative metrics confirm the superior performance of the proposed
method in terms of CLIP Score, FID, and SSIM. The results show that the method
effectively bridges the gap between semantic alignment and structural fidelity
without increasing computational complexity. It demonstrates a strong ability
to generate semantically clear and structurally complete images, offering a
viable technical path for joint text-image modeling and image generation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的TAS框架，用于花样滑冰跳跃动作识别，结合三维特性和语义过程，通过对比学习和精细标注提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 花样滑冰跳跃动作识别需要专业知识，现有TAS方法数据不足且忽略三维特性和动作过程。

Method: 提出VIFSS方法，结合对比学习和动作分类；构建FS-Jump3D数据集；引入精细标注方案。

Result: 在元素级TAS上F1@50超过92%，对比预训练在数据有限时效果显著。

Conclusion: 框架有效解决了数据不足和三维特性问题，适用于实际场景。

Abstract: Understanding human actions from videos plays a critical role across various
domains, including sports analytics. In figure skating, accurately recognizing
the type and timing of jumps a skater performs is essential for objective
performance evaluation. However, this task typically requires expert-level
knowledge due to the fine-grained and complex nature of jump procedures. While
recent approaches have attempted to automate this task using Temporal Action
Segmentation (TAS), there are two major limitations to TAS for figure skating:
the annotated data is insufficient, and existing methods do not account for the
inherent three-dimensional aspects and procedural structure of jump actions. In
this work, we propose a new TAS framework for figure skating jumps that
explicitly incorporates both the three-dimensional nature and the semantic
procedure of jump movements. First, we propose a novel View-Invariant, Figure
Skating-Specific pose representation learning approach (VIFSS) that combines
contrastive learning as pre-training and action classification as fine-tuning.
For view-invariant contrastive pre-training, we construct FS-Jump3D, the first
publicly available 3D pose dataset specialized for figure skating jumps.
Second, we introduce a fine-grained annotation scheme that marks the ``entry
(preparation)'' and ``landing'' phases, enabling TAS models to learn the
procedural structure of jumps. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our framework. Our method achieves over 92% F1@50 on
element-level TAS, which requires recognizing both jump types and rotation
levels. Furthermore, we show that view-invariant contrastive pre-training is
particularly effective when fine-tuning data is limited, highlighting the
practicality of our approach in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and large language models
(LLMs) have greatly enhanced visual reasoning, a key capability for embodied AI
agents like robots. However, existing visual reasoning benchmarks often suffer
from several limitations: they lack a clear definition of reasoning complexity,
offer have no control to generate questions over varying difficulty and task
customization, and fail to provide structured, step-by-step reasoning
annotations (workflows). To bridge these gaps, we formalize reasoning
complexity, introduce an adaptive query engine that generates customizable
questions of varying complexity with detailed intermediate annotations, and
extend the JRDB dataset with human-object interaction and geometric
relationship annotations to create JRDB-Reasoning, a benchmark tailored for
visual reasoning in human-crowded environments. Our engine and benchmark enable
fine-grained evaluation of visual reasoning frameworks and dynamic assessment
of visual-language models across reasoning levels.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于相位一致性加权最小绝对偏差（PCWLAD）的亚像素模板匹配方法，用于提高多模态光学图像的匹配精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态光学图像匹配精度受非线性辐射和几何变形差异影响，需改进方法以提高准确性。

Method: 分两步：粗匹配使用结构相似性指数（SSIM），细匹配使用WLAD，并结合辐射和几何变换模型及互结构滤波。

Result: 在三种数据集上测试，PCWLAD在正确匹配率和均方根误差上优于现有方法，平均匹配精度约0.4像素。

Conclusion: PCWLAD方法在多模态图像匹配中表现出色，软件和数据集已公开。

Abstract: High-accuracy matching of multimodal optical images is the basis of geometric
processing. However, the image matching accuracy is usually degraded by the
nonlinear radiation and geometric deformation differences caused by different
spectral responses. To address these problems, we proposed a phase consistency
weighted least absolute deviation (PCWLAD) sub-pixel template matching method
to improve the matching accuracy of multimodal optical images. This method
consists of two main steps: coarse matching with the structural similarity
index measure (SSIM) and fine matching with WLAD. In the coarse matching step,
PCs are calculated without a noise filter to preserve the original structural
details, and template matching is performed using the SSIM. In the fine
matching step, we applied the radiometric and geometric transformation models
between two multimodal PC templates based on the coarse matching. Furthermore,
mutual structure filtering is adopted in the model to mitigate the impact of
noise within the corresponding templates on the structural consistency, and the
WLAD criterion is used to estimate the sub-pixel offset. To evaluate the
performance of PCWLAD, we created three types of image datasets: visible to
infrared Landsat images, visible to near-infrared close-range images, and
visible to infrared uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) images. PCWLAD outperformed
existing state-of-the-art eight methods in terms of correct matching rate (CMR)
and root mean square error (RMSE) and reached an average matching accuracy of
approximately 0.4 pixels across all three datasets. Our software and datasets
are publicly available at https://github.com/huangtaocsu/PCWLAD.

Method: InterSyn包含两个模块：INS（联合建模单人及交互行为）和REC（优化角色间的动态协调）。

Result: 实验表明，InterSyn生成的动作序列在文本对齐和多样性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: InterSyn为自然动作合成设定了新基准，未来将开源代码。

Abstract: We present Interleaved Learning for Motion Synthesis (InterSyn), a novel
framework that targets the generation of realistic interaction motions by
learning from integrated motions that consider both solo and multi-person
dynamics. Unlike previous methods that treat these components separately,
InterSyn employs an interleaved learning strategy to capture the natural,
dynamic interactions and nuanced coordination inherent in real-world scenarios.
Our framework comprises two key modules: the Interleaved Interaction Synthesis
(INS) module, which jointly models solo and interactive behaviors in a unified
paradigm from a first-person perspective to support multiple character
interactions, and the Relative Coordination Refinement (REC) module, which
refines mutual dynamics and ensures synchronized motions among characters.
Experimental results show that the motion sequences generated by InterSyn
exhibit higher text-to-motion alignment and improved diversity compared with
recent methods, setting a new benchmark for robust and natural motion
synthesis. Additionally, our code will be open-sourced in the future to promote
further research and development in this area.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OoD) detection and segmentation have attracted growing
attention as concerns about AI security rise. Conventional OoD detection
methods identify the existence of OoD objects but lack spatial localization,
limiting their usefulness in downstream tasks. OoD segmentation addresses this
limitation by localizing anomalous objects at pixel-level granularity. This
capability is crucial for safety-critical applications such as autonomous
driving, where perception modules must not only detect but also precisely
segment OoD objects, enabling targeted control actions and enhancing overall
system robustness. In this survey, we group current OoD segmentation approaches
into four categories: (i) test-time OoD segmentation, (ii) outlier exposure for
supervised training, (iii) reconstruction-based methods, (iv) and approaches
that leverage powerful models. We systematically review recent advances in OoD
segmentation for autonomous-driving scenarios, identify emerging challenges,
and discuss promising future research directions.

Abstract: Generative models have made significant progress in synthesizing visual
content, including images, videos, and 3D/4D structures. However, they are
typically trained with surrogate objectives such as likelihood or
reconstruction loss, which often misalign with perceptual quality, semantic
accuracy, or physical realism. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a principled
framework for optimizing non-differentiable, preference-driven, and temporally
structured objectives. Recent advances demonstrate its effectiveness in
enhancing controllability, consistency, and human alignment across generative
tasks. This survey provides a systematic overview of RL-based methods for
visual content generation. We review the evolution of RL from classical control
to its role as a general-purpose optimization tool, and examine its integration
into image, video, and 3D/4D generation. Across these domains, RL serves not
only as a fine-tuning mechanism but also as a structural component for aligning
generation with complex, high-level goals. We conclude with open challenges and
future research directions at the intersection of RL and generative modeling.

Result: 在10多个基准测试上验证，平均性能提升0.9%，技能导向子集提升1.5%。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在指令选择中平衡概念知识与视觉技能的重要性。

Abstract: Vision-language instruction tuning achieves two main purposes: learning
visual concepts and learning visual skills. In this paper, we found that
vision-language benchmarks fall into the dichotomy of mainly benefiting from
training on instructions with similar skills or visual concepts. Inspired by
the discovery, we designed a simple targeted training data selection method to
optimize the performance of a given benchmark. We first extract the
concepts/skills from the benchmark, determine whether the benchmark
predominantly benefits from similar concepts or skills, and finally select
instructions with the most matching concepts/skills. Experiments on 10+
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our targeted data selection method,
showing +0.9\% over the best existing baseline averaged over all benchmarks and
+1.5\% on the skill-focused subset. Our findings underscore the importance of
recognizing the inherent trade-off within instruction selection, which requires
balancing the acquisition of conceptual knowledge against visual skill.

Motivation: 当前研究多关注单一超微结构识别，难以满足实际诊断需求，需开发同时量化多种特征的工具。

Method: 基于三个深度学习模型（超微结构分割、肾小球滤过屏障分类、电子致密沉积物检测），遵循常规肾活检诊断协议。

Result: 在115名患者中验证，自动量化结果与病理报告形态描述一致，具备高精度和高通量特性。

Abstract: Complex and diverse ultrastructural features can indicate the type,
progression, and prognosis of kidney diseases. Recently, computational
pathology combined with deep learning methods has shown tremendous potential in
advancing automatic morphological analysis of glomerular ultrastructure.
However, current research predominantly focuses on the recognition of
individual ultrastructure, which makes it challenging to meet practical
diagnostic needs. In this study, we propose the glomerular morphometry
framework of ultrastructural characterization (Glo-DMU), which is grounded on
three deep models: the ultrastructure segmentation model, the glomerular
filtration barrier region classification model, and the electron-dense deposits
detection model. Following the conventional protocol of renal biopsy diagnosis,
this framework simultaneously quantifies the three most widely used
ultrastructural features: the thickness of glomerular basement membrane, the
degree of foot process effacement, and the location of electron-dense deposits.
We evaluated the 115 patients with 9 renal pathological types in real-world
diagnostic scenarios, demonstrating good consistency between automatic
quantification results and morphological descriptions in the pathological
reports. Glo-DMU possesses the characteristics of full automation, high
precision, and high throughput, quantifying multiple ultrastructural features
simultaneously, and providing an efficient tool for assisting renal
pathologists.

Conclusion: AtomDiffuser为可视化和量化与辐射诱导原子不稳定性相关的降解模式提供了工具，推动了原子分辨率下材料动态的研究。

Abstract: Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) plays a critical role in
modern materials science, enabling direct imaging of atomic structures and
their evolution under external interferences. However, interpreting
time-resolved STEM data remains challenging due to two entangled degradation
effects: spatial drift caused by mechanical and thermal instabilities, and
beam-induced signal loss resulting from radiation damage. These factors distort
both geometry and intensity in complex, temporally correlated ways, making it
difficult for existing methods to explicitly separate their effects or model
material dynamics at atomic resolution. In this work, we present AtomDiffuser,
a time-aware degradation modeling framework that disentangles sample drift and
radiometric attenuation by predicting an affine transformation and a spatially
varying decay map between any two STEM frames. Unlike traditional denoising or
registration pipelines, our method leverages degradation as a physically
heuristic, temporally conditioned process, enabling interpretable structural
evolutions across time. Trained on synthetic degradation processes,
AtomDiffuser also generalizes well to real-world cryo-STEM data. It further
supports high-resolution degradation inference and drift alignment, offering
tools for visualizing and quantifying degradation patterns that correlate with
radiation-induced atomic instabilities.

Abstract: Assessing the alignment of multimodal vision-language models~(VLMs) with
human perception is essential to understand how they perceive low-level visual
features. A key characteristic of human vision is the contrast sensitivity
function (CSF), which describes sensitivity to spatial frequency at
low-contrasts. Here, we introduce a novel behavioral psychophysics-inspired
method to estimate the CSF of chat-based VLMs by directly prompting them to
judge pattern visibility at different contrasts for each frequency. This
methodology is closer to the real experiments in psychophysics than the
previously reported. Using band-pass filtered noise images and a diverse set of
prompts, we assess model responses across multiple architectures. We find that
while some models approximate human-like CSF shape or magnitude, none fully
replicate both. Notably, prompt phrasing has a large effect on the responses,
raising concerns about prompt stability. Our results provide a new framework
for probing visual sensitivity in multimodal models and reveal key gaps between
their visual representations and human perception.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像生成模型因缺乏对场景结构和空间布局的充分理解，常生成空间不一致和扭曲的图像。

Method: 利用预训练估计器从图像数据集中提取场景内在属性，并通过自编码器将其聚合成单一潜在变量，结合预训练的潜在扩散模型（LDM）同时去噪图像和内在属性域。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能纠正空间不一致性，生成更自然的场景布局，同时保持基础模型（如Stable Diffusion）的保真度和文本对齐性。

Conclusion: 通过共同生成图像和内在属性，模型能隐式捕捉场景结构，生成更一致和真实的图像。

Abstract: Image generation models trained on large datasets can synthesize high-quality
images but often produce spatially inconsistent and distorted images due to
limited information about the underlying structures and spatial layouts. In
this work, we leverage intrinsic scene properties (e.g., depth, segmentation
maps) that provide rich information about the underlying scene, unlike prior
approaches that solely rely on image-text pairs or use intrinsics as
conditional inputs. Our approach aims to co-generate both images and their
corresponding intrinsics, enabling the model to implicitly capture the
underlying scene structure and generate more spatially consistent and realistic
images. Specifically, we first extract rich intrinsic scene properties from a
large image dataset with pre-trained estimators, eliminating the need for
additional scene information or explicit 3D representations. We then aggregate
various intrinsic scene properties into a single latent variable using an
autoencoder. Building upon pre-trained large-scale Latent Diffusion Models
(LDMs), our method simultaneously denoises the image and intrinsic domains by
carefully sharing mutual information so that the image and intrinsic reflect
each other without degrading image quality. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method corrects spatial inconsistencies and produces a more natural
layout of scenes while maintaining the fidelity and textual alignment of the
base model (e.g., Stable Diffusion).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实数据集存在隐式标签噪声（如模糊边界和标注者差异），传统数据增强方法可能放大这些噪声，限制模型泛化能力。

Method: 提出NSegment+框架，仅对标签施加弹性变形，保持图像不变，以学习对标签不一致的鲁棒表示。

Result: 在多个数据集（Vaihingen、LoveDA、Cityscapes、PASCAL VOC）上平均mIoU提升显著，最高达+3.39。

Conclusion: NSegment+有效解决了隐式标签噪声问题，性能提升显著，且可与其他训练技巧结合进一步优化。

Abstract: While previous studies on image segmentation focus on handling severe (or
explicit) label noise, real-world datasets also exhibit subtle (or implicit)
label imperfections. These arise from inherent challenges, such as ambiguous
object boundaries and annotator variability. Although not explicitly present,
such mild and latent noise can still impair model performance. Typical data
augmentation methods, which apply identical transformations to the image and
its label, risk amplifying these subtle imperfections and limiting the model's
generalization capacity. In this paper, we introduce NSegment+, a novel
augmentation framework that decouples image and label transformations to
address such realistic noise for semantic segmentation. By introducing
controlled elastic deformations only to segmentation labels while preserving
the original images, our method encourages models to focus on learning robust
representations of object structures despite minor label inconsistencies.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that NSegment+ consistently improves
performance, achieving mIoU gains of up to +2.29, +2.38, +1.75, and +3.39 in
average on Vaihingen, LoveDA, Cityscapes, and PASCAL VOC, respectively-even
without bells and whistles, highlighting the importance of addressing implicit
label noise. These gains can be further amplified when combined with other
training tricks, including CutMix and Label Smoothing.

Result: 实验表明PQ-DAF显著提升了少样本条件下的检测性能和泛化能力。

Conclusion: PQ-DAF为数据稀缺场景下的驾驶员分心检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Driver distraction detection is essential for improving traffic safety and
reducing road accidents. However, existing models often suffer from degraded
generalization when deployed in real-world scenarios. This limitation primarily
arises from the few-shot learning challenge caused by the high cost of data
annotation in practical environments, as well as the substantial domain shift
between training datasets and target deployment conditions. To address these
issues, we propose a Pose-driven Quality-controlled Data Augmentation Framework
(PQ-DAF) that leverages a vision-language model for sample filtering to
cost-effectively expand training data and enhance cross-domain robustness.
Specifically, we employ a Progressive Conditional Diffusion Model (PCDMs) to
accurately capture key driver pose features and synthesize diverse training
examples. A sample quality assessment module, built upon the CogVLM
vision-language model, is then introduced to filter out low-quality synthetic
samples based on a confidence threshold, ensuring the reliability of the
augmented dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PQ-DAF substantially
improves performance in few-shot driver distraction detection, achieving
significant gains in model generalization under data-scarce conditions.

### [31] [Translation of Text Embedding via Delta Vector to Suppress Strongly Entangled Content in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10407)
*Eunseo Koh,Seunghoo Hong,Tae-Young Kim,Simon S. Woo,Jae-Pil Heo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新方法，通过修改文本嵌入空间中的delta向量来抑制扩散模型中与特定词强关联的内容，并进一步优化为选择性抑制方法（SSDV），显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像扩散模型中与特定词强关联内容难以抑制的问题，例如生成‘Charlie Chaplin’时无法避免‘mustache’。

Method: 引入delta向量修改文本嵌入，并通过零样本方法获取；进一步提出SSDV方法，将delta向量应用于交叉注意力机制，优化个性化模型中的抑制效果。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在定量和定性指标上均显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了扩散模型中内容抑制的难题，为个性化生成提供了更精确的控制。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models have made significant progress in
generating diverse high-quality images from textual prompts. However, these
models still face challenges in suppressing content that is strongly entangled
with specific words. For example, when generating an image of ``Charlie
Chaplin", a ``mustache" consistently appears even if explicitly instructed not
to include it, as the concept of ``mustache" is strongly entangled with
``Charlie Chaplin". To address this issue, we propose a novel approach to
directly suppress such entangled content within the text embedding space of
diffusion models. Our method introduces a delta vector that modifies the text
embedding to weaken the influence of undesired content in the generated image,
and we further demonstrate that this delta vector can be easily obtained
through a zero-shot approach. Furthermore, we propose a Selective Suppression
with Delta Vector (SSDV) method to adapt delta vector into the cross-attention
mechanism, enabling more effective suppression of unwanted content in regions
where it would otherwise be generated. Additionally, we enabled more precise
suppression in personalized T2I models by optimizing delta vector, which
previous baselines were unable to achieve. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods, both
in terms of quantitative and qualitative metrics.

TL;DR: SC-Lane是一种新颖的3D车道检测框架，通过自适应融合坡度特征和时间一致性提升高度图估计的鲁棒性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖固定坡度锚点，难以适应多样化道路几何形状，SC-Lane旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出Slope-Aware Adaptive Feature模块动态预测权重，融合多坡度特征；Height Consistency模块确保时间一致性。

Result: 在OpenLane基准测试中，SC-Lane以64.3%的F-score显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SC-Lane通过自适应和时间一致性设计，显著提升了3D车道检测性能，为未来研究设定了新标准。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce SC-Lane, a novel slope-aware and temporally
consistent heightmap estimation framework for 3D lane detection. Unlike
previous approaches that rely on fixed slope anchors, SC-Lane adaptively
determines the fusion of slope-specific height features, improving robustness
to diverse road geometries. To achieve this, we propose a Slope-Aware Adaptive
Feature module that dynamically predicts the appropriate weights from image
cues for integrating multi-slope representations into a unified heightmap.
Additionally, a Height Consistency Module enforces temporal coherence, ensuring
stable and accurate height estimation across consecutive frames, which is
crucial for real-world driving scenarios. To evaluate the effectiveness of
SC-Lane, we employ three standardized metrics-Mean Absolute Error(MAE), Root
Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and threshold-based accuracy-which, although common
in surface and depth estimation, have been underutilized for road height
assessment. Using the LiDAR-derived heightmap dataset introduced in prior work
[20], we benchmark our method under these metrics, thereby establishing a
rigorous standard for future comparisons. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane
benchmark demonstrate that SC-Lane significantly improves both height
estimation and 3D lane detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance with
an F-score of 64.3%, outperforming existing methods by a notable margin. For

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于ControlNet的方法在DiTs中引入过多参数和计算成本，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 采用Flux作为骨干网络，设计LoRA风格控制模块和KV-Context增强机制，直接学习控制信号并融合条件特征。

Result: NanoControl仅增加0.024%参数和0.029% GFLOPs，实现了高效可控生成，并在基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: NanoControl在减少计算开销的同时，提升了可控性和生成质量，为高效可控文本到图像生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in
text-to-image synthesis. However, in the domain of controllable text-to-image
generation using DiTs, most existing methods still rely on the ControlNet
paradigm originally designed for UNet-based diffusion models. This paradigm
introduces significant parameter overhead and increased computational costs. To
address these challenges, we propose the Nano Control Diffusion Transformer
(NanoControl), which employs Flux as the backbone network. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art controllable text-to-image generation performance while
incurring only a 0.024\% increase in parameter count and a 0.029\% increase in
GFLOPs, thus enabling highly efficient controllable generation. Specifically,
rather than duplicating the DiT backbone for control, we design a LoRA-style
(low-rank adaptation) control module that directly learns control signals from
raw conditioning inputs. Furthermore, we introduce a KV-Context Augmentation
mechanism that integrates condition-specific key-value information into the
backbone in a simple yet highly effective manner, facilitating deep fusion of
conditional features. Extensive benchmark experiments demonstrate that
NanoControl significantly reduces computational overhead compared to
conventional control approaches, while maintaining superior generation quality
and achieving improved controllability.

TL;DR: STRIDE-QA是一个针对自动驾驶的大规模视觉问答数据集，填补了现有视觉语言模型在动态交通场景理解上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型基于静态图像文本对训练，无法满足动态交通场景的时空推理需求。

Method: 利用100小时东京多传感器驾驶数据构建STRIDE-QA数据集，包含1600万QA对和28.5万帧，支持空间定位和时间预测任务。

Result: 微调后的模型在空间定位和未来运动预测任务中表现显著优于通用模型（55% vs. 近0%）。

Conclusion: STRIDE-QA为开发更可靠的自动驾驶视觉语言模型提供了基础。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been applied to autonomous driving to
support decision-making in complex real-world scenarios. However, their
training on static, web-sourced image-text pairs fundamentally limits the
precise spatiotemporal reasoning required to understand and predict dynamic
traffic scenes. We address this critical gap with STRIDE-QA, a large-scale
visual question answering (VQA) dataset for physically grounded reasoning from
an ego-centric perspective. Constructed from 100 hours of multi-sensor driving
data in Tokyo, capturing diverse and challenging conditions, STRIDE-QA is the
largest VQA dataset for spatiotemporal reasoning in urban driving, offering 16
million QA pairs over 285K frames. Grounded by dense, automatically generated
annotations including 3D bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and multi-object
tracks, the dataset uniquely supports both object-centric and ego-centric
reasoning through three novel QA tasks that require spatial localization and
temporal prediction. Our benchmarks demonstrate that existing VLMs struggle
significantly, achieving near-zero scores on prediction consistency. In
contrast, VLMs fine-tuned on STRIDE-QA exhibit dramatic performance gains,
achieving 55% success in spatial localization and 28% consistency in future
motion prediction, compared to near-zero scores from general-purpose VLMs.
Therefore, STRIDE-QA establishes a comprehensive foundation for developing more
reliable VLMs for safety-critical autonomous systems.

Result: 在YouTube-VIS数据集上显著优于现有方法，避免了灾难性遗忘，提升了分割和分类性能。

Conclusion: CRISP为持续视频实例分割提供了一种有效的解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Continual video instance segmentation demands both the plasticity to absorb
new object categories and the stability to retain previously learned ones, all
while preserving temporal consistency across frames. In this work, we introduce
Contrastive Residual Injection and Semantic Prompting (CRISP), an earlier
attempt tailored to address the instance-wise, category-wise, and task-wise
confusion in continual video instance segmentation. For instance-wise learning,
we model instance tracking and construct instance correlation loss, which
emphasizes the correlation with the prior query space while strengthening the
specificity of the current task query. For category-wise learning, we build an
adaptive residual semantic prompt (ARSP) learning framework, which constructs a
learnable semantic residual prompt pool generated by category text and uses an
adjustive query-prompt matching mechanism to build a mapping relationship
between the query of the current task and the semantic residual prompt.
Meanwhile, a semantic consistency loss based on the contrastive learning is
introduced to maintain semantic coherence between object queries and residual
prompts during incremental training. For task-wise learning, to ensure the
correlation at the inter-task level within the query space, we introduce a
concise yet powerful initialization strategy for incremental prompts. Extensive
experiments on YouTube-VIS-2019 and YouTube-VIS-2021 datasets demonstrate that
CRISP significantly outperforms existing continual segmentation methods in the
long-term continual video instance segmentation task, avoiding catastrophic
forgetting and effectively improving segmentation and classification
performance. The code is available at https://github.com/01upup10/CRISP.

Motivation: 现有方法需要双模态标注，成本高；DOD-SA旨在通过单模态标注实现高效跨模态知识迁移。

Result: 在DroneVehicle数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DOD-SA通过创新设计和训练策略，有效解决了双模态标注的高成本问题，并提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Infrared-visible object detection has shown great potential in real-world
applications, enabling robust all-day perception by leveraging the
complementary information of infrared and visible images. However, existing
methods typically require dual-modality annotations to output detection results
for both modalities during prediction, which incurs high annotation costs. To
address this challenge, we propose a novel infrared-visible Decoupled Object
Detection framework with Single-modality Annotations, called DOD-SA. The
architecture of DOD-SA is built upon a Single- and Dual-Modality Collaborative
Teacher-Student Network (CoSD-TSNet), which consists of a single-modality
branch (SM-Branch) and a dual-modality decoupled branch (DMD-Branch). The
teacher model generates pseudo-labels for the unlabeled modality,
simultaneously supporting the training of the student model. The collaborative
design enables cross-modality knowledge transfer from the labeled modality to
the unlabeled modality, and facilitates effective SM-to-DMD branch supervision.
To further improve the decoupling ability of the model and the pseudo-label
quality, we introduce a Progressive and Self-Tuning Training Strategy (PaST)
that trains the model in three stages: (1) pretraining SM-Branch, (2) guiding
the learning of DMD-Branch by SM-Branch, and (3) refining DMD-Branch. In
addition, we design a Pseudo Label Assigner (PLA) to align and pair labels
across modalities, explicitly addressing modality misalignment during training.
Extensive experiments on the DroneVehicle dataset demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA).

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扫描的电气布局图缺乏机器可读性，导致大规模解析耗时且易出错，亟需自动化解决方案。

Method: 使用预训练的目标检测模型（如YOLOv8）对标注的电气布局图数据集（DELP）进行系统评估，并开发工具包SkeySpot。

Result: YOLOv8在DELP数据集上表现最佳，mAP达82.5%。SkeySpot能生成标准化输出，支持下游应用。

Conclusion: 该方法降低了中小企业在电气布局数字化中对专有CAD系统的依赖，推动了标准化和互操作性。

Abstract: Legacy floor plans, often preserved only as scanned documents, remain
essential resources for architecture, urban planning, and facility management
in the construction industry. However, the lack of machine-readable floor plans
render large-scale interpretation both time-consuming and error-prone.
Automated symbol spotting offers a scalable solution by enabling the
identification of service key symbols directly from floor plans, supporting
workflows such as cost estimation, infrastructure maintenance, and regulatory
compliance. This work introduces a labelled Digitised Electrical Layout Plans
(DELP) dataset comprising 45 scanned electrical layout plans annotated with
2,450 instances across 34 distinct service key classes. A systematic evaluation
framework is proposed using pretrained object detection models for DELP
dataset. Among the models benchmarked, YOLOv8 achieves the highest performance
with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 82.5\%. Using YOLOv8, we develop
SkeySpot, a lightweight, open-source toolkit for real-time detection,
classification, and quantification of electrical symbols. SkeySpot produces
structured, standardised outputs that can be scaled up for interoperable
building information workflows, ultimately enabling compatibility across
downstream applications and regulatory platforms. By lowering dependency on
proprietary CAD systems and reducing manual annotation effort, this approach
makes the digitisation of electrical layouts more accessible to small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the construction industry, while supporting
broader goals of standardisation, interoperability, and sustainability in the
built environment.

Motivation: 探索人类视觉感知是否源于图像统计特性，并验证生物启发模型能否在不依赖人类监督的情况下学习感知度量。

Method: 设计PerceptNet模型，针对图像重建任务（如自动编码、去噪、去模糊和稀疏正则化）进行端到端优化。

Result: 编码器阶段（V1皮层类似层）与人类感知判断高度相关，且在中等噪声、模糊和稀疏水平下表现最佳。

Conclusion: 视觉系统可能针对特定失真水平进行优化，生物启发模型可无监督学习感知度量。

Abstract: A number of scientists suggested that human visual perception may emerge from
image statistics, shaping efficient neural representations in early vision. In
this work, a bio-inspired architecture that can accommodate several known facts
in the retina-V1 cortex, the PerceptNet, has been end-to-end optimized for
different tasks related to image reconstruction: autoencoding, denoising,
deblurring, and sparsity regularization. Our results show that the encoder
stage (V1-like layer) consistently exhibits the highest correlation with human
perceptual judgments on image distortion despite not using perceptual
information in the initialization or training. This alignment exhibits an
optimum for moderate noise, blur and sparsity. These findings suggest that the
visual system may be tuned to remove those particular levels of distortion with
that level of sparsity and that biologically inspired models can learn
perceptual metrics without human supervision.

Motivation: 现有在线视频超分辨率方法仅利用相邻前一帧进行时间对齐，限制了长时建模能力。状态空间模型（SSMs）因其线性计算复杂度和全局感受野，显著提升了效率和性能。

Method: TS-Mamba通过构建视频轨迹选择相似token，并利用轨迹感知移位Mamba聚合模块（TSMA）进行信息聚合。移位SSMs块基于Hilbert扫描设计，补偿扫描损失并增强空间连续性。还提出轨迹感知损失函数监督轨迹生成。

Conclusion: TS-Mamba通过长时轨迹建模和低复杂度Mamba，实现了高效时空信息聚合，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Online video super-resolution (VSR) is an important technique for many
real-world video processing applications, which aims to restore the current
high-resolution video frame based on temporally previous frames. Most of the
existing online VSR methods solely employ one neighboring previous frame to
achieve temporal alignment, which limits long-range temporal modeling of
videos. Recently, state space models (SSMs) have been proposed with linear
computational complexity and a global receptive field, which significantly
improve computational efficiency and performance. In this context, this paper
presents a novel online VSR method based on Trajectory-aware Shifted SSMs
(TS-Mamba), leveraging both long-term trajectory modeling and low-complexity
Mamba to achieve efficient spatio-temporal information aggregation.
Specifically, TS-Mamba first constructs the trajectories within a video to
select the most similar tokens from the previous frames. Then, a
Trajectory-aware Shifted Mamba Aggregation (TSMA) module consisting of proposed
shifted SSMs blocks is employed to aggregate the selected tokens. The shifted
SSMs blocks are designed based on Hilbert scannings and corresponding shift
operations to compensate for scanning losses and strengthen the spatial
continuity of Mamba. Additionally, we propose a trajectory-aware loss function
to supervise the trajectory generation, ensuring the accuracy of token
selection when training our model. Extensive experiments on three widely used
VSR test datasets demonstrate that compared with six online VSR benchmark
models, our TS-Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance in most cases and
over 22.7\% complexity reduction (in MACs). The source code for TS-Mamba will
be available at https://github.com.

Conclusion: 结合领域随机化和自编码器质量控制，能有效实现半监督分割，减轻标注负担，适用于新解剖结构或新兴成像技术研究。

Abstract: Deep learning segmentation relies heavily on labeled data, but manual
labeling is laborious and time-consuming, especially for volumetric images such
as brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). While recent domain-randomization
techniques alleviate the dependency on labeled data by synthesizing diverse
training images from label maps, they offer limited anatomical variability when
very few label maps are available. Semi-supervised self-training addresses
label scarcity by iteratively incorporating model predictions into the training
set, enabling networks to learn from unlabeled data. In this work, we combine
domain randomization with self-training to train three-dimensional
skull-stripping networks using as little as a single labeled example. First, we
automatically bin voxel intensities, yielding labels we use to synthesize
images for training an initial skull-stripping model. Second, we train a
convolutional autoencoder (AE) on the labeled example and use its
reconstruction error to assess the quality of brain masks predicted for
unlabeled data. Third, we select the top-ranking pseudo-labels to fine-tune the
network, achieving skull-stripping performance on out-of-distribution data that
approaches models trained with more labeled images. We compare AE-based ranking
to consistency-based ranking under test-time augmentation, finding that the AE
approach yields a stronger correlation with segmentation accuracy. Our results
highlight the potential of combining domain randomization and AE-based quality
control to enable effective semi-supervised segmentation from extremely limited
labeled data. This strategy may ease the labeling burden that slows progress in
studies involving new anatomical structures or emerging imaging techniques.

Abstract: Human Action Recognition (HAR) plays a crucial role in healthcare, fitness
tracking, and ambient assisted living technologies. While traditional vision
based HAR systems are effective, they pose privacy concerns. mmWave radar
sensors offer a privacy preserving alternative but present challenges due to
the sparse and noisy nature of their point cloud data. In the literature, three
primary data processing methods: Density-Based Spatial Clustering of
Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), the Hungarian Algorithm, and Kalman Filtering
have been widely used to improve the quality and continuity of radar data.
However, a comprehensive evaluation of these methods, both individually and in
combination, remains lacking. This paper addresses that gap by conducting a
detailed performance analysis of the three methods using the MiliPoint dataset.
We evaluate each method individually, all possible pairwise combinations, and
the combination of all three, assessing both recognition accuracy and
computational cost. Furthermore, we propose targeted enhancements to the
individual methods aimed at improving accuracy. Our results provide crucial
insights into the strengths and trade-offs of each method and their
integrations, guiding future work on mmWave based HAR systems

Motivation: STAS与肺腺癌的复发和生存率降低相关，但大规模诊断存在劳动密集和误诊风险，亟需深度学习模型辅助。

Method: 研究收集了多中心组织病理学图像，构建STAS-SXY、STAS-TXY和STAS-TCGA数据集，并提出STAMP框架，结合双分支架构、Transformer编码和多模式注意力模块。

Result: STAMP在三个数据集上的AUC分别为0.8058、0.8017和0.7928，优于临床水平。

Conclusion: STAMP框架能有效诊断STAS，具有临床应用的潜力。

Abstract: Spread through air spaces (STAS) constitutes a novel invasive pattern in lung
adenocarcinoma (LUAD), associated with tumor recurrence and diminished survival
rates. However, large-scale STAS diagnosis in LUAD remains a labor-intensive
endeavor, compounded by the propensity for oversight and misdiagnosis due to
its distinctive pathological characteristics and morphological features.
Consequently, there is a pressing clinical imperative to leverage deep learning
models for STAS diagnosis. This study initially assembled histopathological
images from STAS patients at the Second Xiangya Hospital and the Third Xiangya
Hospital of Central South University, alongside the TCGA-LUAD cohort. Three
senior pathologists conducted cross-verification annotations to construct the
STAS-SXY, STAS-TXY, and STAS-TCGA datasets. We then propose a multi-pattern
attention-aware multiple instance learning framework, named STAMP, to analyze
and diagnose the presence of STAS across multi-center histopathology images.
Specifically, the dual-branch architecture guides the model to learn
STAS-associated pathological features from distinct semantic spaces.
Transformer-based instance encoding and a multi-pattern attention aggregation
modules dynamically selects regions closely associated with STAS pathology,
suppressing irrelevant noise and enhancing the discriminative power of global
representations. Moreover, a similarity regularization constraint prevents
feature redundancy across branches, thereby improving overall diagnostic
accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrated that STAMP achieved competitive
diagnostic results on STAS-SXY, STAS-TXY and STAS-TCGA, with AUCs of 0.8058,
0.8017, and 0.7928, respectively, surpassing the clinical level.

*Jianda Mao,Kaibo Wang,Yang Xiang,Kani Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TweezeEdit是一种无需调优和反转的图像编辑框架，通过正则化整个去噪路径而非依赖反转锚点，实现高效且语义保留的图像编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的图像编辑方法过度依赖目标提示，导致源图像语义保留不足且编辑路径冗长。

Method: 提出TweezeEdit框架，通过梯度驱动的正则化，在一致性模型的指导下直接注入目标提示语义。

Result: 实验表明，TweezeEdit在语义保留和目标对齐上优于现有方法，仅需12步（1.6秒/次编辑）。

Conclusion: TweezeEdit高效且适用于实时应用，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Large-scale pre-trained diffusion models empower users to edit images through
text guidance. However, existing methods often over-align with target prompts
while inadequately preserving source image semantics. Such approaches generate
target images explicitly or implicitly from the inversion noise of the source
images, termed the inversion anchors. We identify this strategy as suboptimal
for semantic preservation and inefficient due to elongated editing paths. We
propose TweezeEdit, a tuning- and inversion-free framework for consistent and
efficient image editing. Our method addresses these limitations by regularizing
the entire denoising path rather than relying solely on the inversion anchors,
ensuring source semantic retention and shortening editing paths. Guided by
gradient-driven regularization, we efficiently inject target prompt semantics
along a direct path using a consistency model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate TweezeEdit's superior performance in semantic preservation and
target alignment, outperforming existing methods. Remarkably, it requires only
12 steps (1.6 seconds per edit), underscoring its potential for real-time
applications.

Motivation: 现有3D高斯泼溅技术在优化过程中缺乏几何约束，导致高频纹理和锐利不连续区域的模糊重建。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了细节模糊问题，同时保持了全局一致性和实时渲染能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian splatting have significantly improved
real-time novel view synthesis, yet insufficient geometric constraints during
scene optimization often result in blurred reconstructions of fine-grained
details, particularly in regions with high-frequency textures and sharp
discontinuities. To address this, we propose a comprehensive optimization
framework integrating multisample anti-aliasing (MSAA) with dual geometric
constraints. Our system computes pixel colors through adaptive blending of
quadruple subsamples, effectively reducing aliasing artifacts in high-frequency
components. The framework introduces two constraints: (a) an adaptive weighting
strategy that prioritizes under-reconstructed regions through dynamic gradient
analysis, and (b) gradient differential constraints enforcing geometric
regularization at object boundaries. This targeted optimization enables the
model to allocate computational resources preferentially to critical regions
requiring refinement while maintaining global consistency. Extensive
experimental evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance in detail preservation, particularly in
preserving high-frequency textures and sharp discontinuities, while maintaining
real-time rendering efficiency. Quantitative metrics and perceptual studies
confirm statistically significant improvements over baseline approaches in both
structural similarity (SSIM) and perceptual quality (LPIPS).

Abstract: Bolt defect detection is critical to ensure the safety of transmission lines.
However, the scarcity of defect images and imbalanced data distributions
significantly limit detection performance. To address this problem, we propose
a segmentationdriven bolt defect editing method (SBDE) to augment the dataset.
First, a bolt attribute segmentation model (Bolt-SAM) is proposed, which
enhances the segmentation of complex bolt attributes through the CLAHE-FFT
Adapter (CFA) and Multipart- Aware Mask Decoder (MAMD), generating high-quality
masks for subsequent editing tasks. Second, a mask optimization module (MOD) is
designed and integrated with the image inpainting model (LaMa) to construct the
bolt defect attribute editing model (MOD-LaMa), which converts normal bolts
into defective ones through attribute editing. Finally, an editing recovery
augmentation (ERA) strategy is proposed to recover and put the edited defect
bolts back into the original inspection scenes and expand the defect detection
dataset. We constructed multiple bolt datasets and conducted extensive
experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that the bolt defect images
generated by SBDE significantly outperform state-of-the-art image editing
models, and effectively improve the performance of bolt defect detection, which
fully verifies the effectiveness and application potential of the proposed
method. The code of the project is available at

Conclusion: 该方法在理论和实验上均表现出色，为舞蹈动作预测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Estimating human dance motion is a challenging task with various industrial
applications. Recently, many efforts have focused on predicting human dance
motion using either egocentric video or music as input. However, the task of
jointly estimating human motion from both egocentric video and music remains
largely unexplored. In this paper, we aim to develop a new method that predicts
human dance motion from both egocentric video and music. In practice, the
egocentric view often obscures much of the body, making accurate full-pose
estimation challenging. Additionally, incorporating music requires the
generated head and body movements to align well with both visual and musical
inputs. We first introduce EgoAIST++, a new large-scale dataset that combines
both egocentric views and music with more than 36 hours of dancing motion.
Drawing on the success of diffusion models and Mamba on modeling sequences, we
develop an EgoMusic Motion Network with a core Skeleton Mamba that explicitly
captures the skeleton structure of the human body. We illustrate that our
approach is theoretically supportive. Intensive experiments show that our
method clearly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and generalizes
effectively to real-world data.

Abstract: Visual reasoning is critical for a wide range of computer vision tasks that
go beyond surface-level object detection and classification. Despite notable
advances in relational, symbolic, temporal, causal, and commonsense reasoning,
existing surveys often address these directions in isolation, lacking a unified
analysis and comparison across reasoning types, methodologies, and evaluation
protocols. This survey aims to address this gap by categorizing visual
reasoning into five major types (relational, symbolic, temporal, causal, and
commonsense) and systematically examining their implementation through
architectures such as graph-based models, memory networks, attention
mechanisms, and neuro-symbolic systems. We review evaluation protocols designed
to assess functional correctness, structural consistency, and causal validity,
and critically analyze their limitations in terms of generalizability,
reproducibility, and explanatory power. Beyond evaluation, we identify key open
challenges in visual reasoning, including scalability to complex scenes, deeper
integration of symbolic and neural paradigms, the lack of comprehensive
benchmark datasets, and reasoning under weak supervision. Finally, we outline a
forward-looking research agenda for next-generation vision systems, emphasizing
that bridging perception and reasoning is essential for building transparent,
trustworthy, and cross-domain adaptive AI systems, particularly in critical
domains such as autonomous driving and medical diagnostics.

Abstract: Medical image grounding aims to align natural language phrases with specific
regions in medical images, serving as a foundational task for intelligent
diagnosis, visual question answering (VQA), and automated report generation
(MRG). However, existing research is constrained by limited modality coverage,
coarse-grained annotations, and the absence of a unified, generalizable
grounding framework. To address these challenges, we construct a large-scale
medical grounding dataset Med-GLIP-5M comprising over 5.3 million region-level
annotations across seven imaging modalities, covering diverse anatomical
structures and pathological findings. The dataset supports both segmentation
and grounding tasks with hierarchical region labels, ranging from organ-level
boundaries to fine-grained lesions. Based on this foundation, we propose
Med-GLIP, a modality-aware grounding framework trained on Med-GLIP-5M. Rather
than relying on explicitly designed expert modules, Med-GLIP implicitly
acquires hierarchical semantic understanding from diverse training data --
enabling it to recognize multi-granularity structures, such as distinguishing
lungs from pneumonia lesions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Med-GLIP
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple grounding
benchmarks. Furthermore, integrating its spatial outputs into downstream tasks,
including medical VQA and report generation, leads to substantial performance
gains. Our dataset will be released soon.

Motivation: 遥感图像中显著目标检测面临目标尺度变化大、背景对比度低等问题，现有方法难以有效整合全局和局部特征。

Result: 实验结果表明，GCRPNet在性能上达到最优。

Conclusion: GCRPNet通过创新的模块设计，显著提升了显著目标检测的效果。

Abstract: Salient object detection (SOD) in optical remote sensing images (ORSIs) faces
numerous challenges, including significant variations in target scales and low
contrast between targets and the background. Existing methods based on vision
transformers (ViTs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) architectures aim
to leverage both global and local features, but the difficulty in effectively
integrating these heterogeneous features limits their overall performance. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a graph-enhanced contextual and regional
perception network (GCRPNet), which builds upon the Mamba architecture to
simultaneously capture long-range dependencies and enhance regional feature
representation. Specifically, we employ the visual state space (VSS) encoder to
extract multi-scale features. To further achieve deep guidance and enhancement
of these features, we first design a difference-similarity guided hierarchical
graph attention module (DS-HGAM). This module strengthens cross-layer
interaction capabilities between features of different scales while enhancing
the model's structural perception,allowing it to distinguish between foreground
and background more effectively. Then, we design the LEVSS block as the decoder
of GCRPNet. This module integrates our proposed adaptive scanning strategy and
multi-granularity collaborative attention enhancement module (MCAEM). It
performs adaptive patch scanning on feature maps processed via multi-scale
convolutions, thereby capturing rich local region information and enhancing
Mamba's local modeling capability. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its
effectiveness and superiority.

Conclusion: PSScreen通过创新方法显著提升了多疾病筛查的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Leveraging multiple partially labeled datasets to train a model for multiple
retinal disease screening reduces the reliance on fully annotated datasets, but
remains challenging due to significant domain shifts across training datasets
from various medical sites, and the label absent issue for partial classes. To
solve these challenges, we propose PSScreen, a novel Partially Supervised
multiple retinal disease Screening model. Our PSScreen consists of two streams
and one learns deterministic features and the other learns probabilistic
features via uncertainty injection. Then, we leverage the textual guidance to
decouple two types of features into disease-wise features and align them via
feature distillation to boost the domain generalization ability. Meanwhile, we
employ pseudo label consistency between two streams to address the label absent
issue and introduce a self-distillation to transfer task-relevant semantics
about known classes from the deterministic to the probabilistic stream to
further enhance the detection performances. Experiments show that our PSScreen
significantly enhances the detection performances on six retinal diseases and
the normal state averagely and achieves state-of-the-art results on both
in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Codes are available at

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) surgical navigation systems are emerging as the next
generation of intraoperative surgical guidance, promising to overcome
limitations of traditional navigation systems. However, known issues with AR
depth perception due to vergence-accommodation conflict and occlusion handling
limitations of the currently commercially available display technology present
acute challenges in surgical settings where precision is paramount. This study
presents a novel methodology for utilizing AR guidance to register anatomical
targets and provide real-time instrument navigation using placement of
simulated external ventricular drain catheters on a phantom model as the
clinical scenario. The system registers target positions to the patient through
a novel surface tracing method and uses real-time infrared tool tracking to aid
in catheter placement, relying only on the onboard sensors of the Microsoft
HoloLens 2. A group of intended users performed the procedure of simulated
insertions under two AR guidance conditions: static in-situ visualization,
where planned trajectories are overlaid directly onto the patient anatomy, and
real-time tool-tracking guidance, where live feedback of the catheter's pose is
provided relative to the plan. Following the insertion tests, computed
tomography scans of the phantom models were acquired, allowing for evaluation
of insertion accuracy, target deviation, angular error, and depth precision.
System Usability Scale surveys assessed user experience and cognitive workload.
Tool-tracking guidance improved performance metrics across all accuracy
measures and was preferred by users in subjective evaluations. A free copy of

Result: 在ImageNet-1k数据集上，RAP在1-shot OOD检测中FPR95降低7.05%，AUROC提升1.71%。

Conclusion: RAP通过检索增强提示，显著提升了OOD检测性能，验证了其模块的有效性和设计动机。

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for the reliable deployment of
machine learning models in-the-wild, enabling accurate identification of test
samples that differ from the training data distribution. Existing methods rely
on auxiliary outlier samples or in-distribution (ID) data to generate outlier
information for training, but due to limited outliers and their mismatch with
real test OOD samples, they often fail to provide sufficient semantic
supervision, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a
novel OOD detection method called Retrieval-Augmented Prompt (RAP). RAP
augments a pre-trained vision-language model's prompts by retrieving external
knowledge, offering enhanced semantic supervision for OOD detection. During
training, RAP retrieves descriptive words for outliers based on joint
similarity with external textual knowledge and uses them to augment the model's
OOD prompts. During testing, RAP dynamically updates OOD prompts in real-time
based on the encountered OOD samples, enabling the model to rapidly adapt to
the test environment. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RAP achieves
state-of-the-art performance on large-scale OOD detection benchmarks. For
example, in 1-shot OOD detection on the ImageNet-1k dataset, RAP reduces the
average FPR95 by 7.05% and improves the AUROC by 1.71% compared to previous
methods. Additionally, comprehensive ablation studies validate the
effectiveness of each module and the underlying motivations of our approach.

Motivation: 解决PTQ导致的性能下降和QAT的高资源消耗问题，提出一种高效的混合量化方法。

Method: 选择输出差异较小的层进行QAT微调，其余层采用PTQ，以减少量化误差传播。

Result: 在多种3D感知任务中表现优于纯QAT，量化精度提升且资源消耗更低。

Conclusion: PTQAT是一种高效通用的量化方法，适用于不同架构和任务，显著提升性能并减少资源需求。

Abstract: Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)
represent two mainstream model quantization approaches. However, PTQ often
leads to unacceptable performance degradation in quantized models, while QAT
imposes substantial GPU memory requirements and extended training time due to
weight fine-tuning.In this paper, we propose PTQAT, a novel general hybrid
quantization algorithm for the efficient deployment of 3D perception networks.
To address the speed accuracy trade-off between PTQ and QAT, our method selects
critical layers for QAT fine-tuning and performs PTQ on the remaining layers.
Contrary to intuition, fine-tuning the layers with smaller output discrepancies
before and after quantization, rather than those with larger discrepancies,
actually leads to greater improvements in the model's quantization accuracy.
This means we better compensate for quantization errors during their
propagation, rather than addressing them at the point where they occur. The
proposed PTQAT achieves similar performance to QAT with more efficiency by
freezing nearly 50% of quantifiable layers. Additionally, PTQAT is a universal
quantization method that supports various quantization bit widths (4 bits) as
well as different model architectures, including CNNs and Transformers. The
experimental results on nuScenes across diverse 3D perception tasks, including
object detection, semantic segmentation, and occupancy prediction, show that
our method consistently outperforms QAT-only baselines. Notably, it achieves
0.2%-0.9% NDS and 0.3%-1.0% mAP gains in object detection, 0.3%-2.0% mIoU gains
in semantic segmentation and occupancy prediction while fine-tuning fewer
weights.

Conclusion: HM-Talker通过混合运动表示和身份无关学习，显著提升了说话头部视频的生成效果。

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head video generation enhances user engagement in
human-computer interaction. However, current methods frequently produce videos
with motion blur and lip jitter, primarily due to their reliance on implicit
modeling of audio-facial motion correlations--an approach lacking explicit
articulatory priors (i.e., anatomical guidance for speech-related facial
movements). To overcome this limitation, we propose HM-Talker, a novel
framework for generating high-fidelity, temporally coherent talking heads.
HM-Talker leverages a hybrid motion representation combining both implicit and
explicit motion cues. Explicit cues use Action Units (AUs), anatomically
defined facial muscle movements, alongside implicit features to minimize
phoneme-viseme misalignment. Specifically, our Cross-Modal Disentanglement
Module (CMDM) extracts complementary implicit/explicit motion features while
predicting AUs directly from audio input aligned to visual cues. To mitigate
identity-dependent biases in explicit features and enhance cross-subject
generalization, we introduce the Hybrid Motion Modeling Module (HMMM). This
module dynamically merges randomly paired implicit/explicit features, enforcing
identity-agnostic learning. Together, these components enable robust lip
synchronization across diverse identities, advancing personalized talking head
synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate HM-Talker's superiority over
state-of-the-art methods in visual quality and lip-sync accuracy.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems promise stronger performance through
unified optimization of perception, motion forecasting, and planning. However,
vision-based approaches face fundamental limitations in adverse weather
conditions, partial occlusions, and precise velocity estimation - critical
challenges in safety-sensitive scenarios where accurate motion understanding
and long-horizon trajectory prediction are essential for collision avoidance.
To address these limitations, we propose SpaRC-AD, a query-based end-to-end
camera-radar fusion framework for planning-oriented autonomous driving. Through
sparse 3D feature alignment, and doppler-based velocity estimation, we achieve
strong 3D scene representations for refinement of agent anchors, map polylines
and motion modelling. Our method achieves strong improvements over the
state-of-the-art vision-only baselines across multiple autonomous driving
tasks, including 3D detection (+4.8% mAP), multi-object tracking (+8.3% AMOTA),
online mapping (+1.8% mAP), motion prediction (-4.0% mADE), and trajectory
planning (-0.1m L2 and -9% TPC). We achieve both spatial coherence and temporal
consistency on multiple challenging benchmarks, including real-world open-loop
nuScenes, long-horizon T-nuScenes, and closed-loop simulator Bench2Drive. We
show the effectiveness of radar-based fusion in safety-critical scenarios where
accurate motion understanding and long-horizon trajectory prediction are
essential for collision avoidance. The source code of all experiments is

Abstract: Foundational models have achieved significant success in diverse domains of
computer vision. They learn general representations that are easily
transferable to tasks not seen during training. One such foundational model is
Segment anything model (SAM), which can accurately segment objects in images.
We propose adapting the SAM encoder via fine-tuning for remote sensing change
detection (RSCD) along with spatial-temporal feature enhancement (STFE) and
multi-scale decoder fusion (MSDF) to detect changes robustly at multiple
scales. Additionally, we propose a novel cross-entropy masking (CEM) loss to
handle high class imbalance in change detection datasets. Our method
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on four change detection datasets,
Levir-CD, WHU-CD, CLCD, and S2Looking. We achieved 2.5% F1-score improvement on
a large complex S2Looking dataset. The code is available at:

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于多模态代理的灵活自适应方法，用于解决基于参考的视频对象分割任务，通过动态工作流和LLM推理能力提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法计算复杂度高且依赖人工标注，而现有基于基础模型的方法缺乏动态适应性。

Result: 在RVOS和Ref-AVS任务上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 多模态代理方法提供了更灵活、自适应的解决方案，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Referring-based Video Object Segmentation is a multimodal problem that
requires producing fine-grained segmentation results guided by external cues.
Traditional approaches to this task typically involve training specialized
models, which come with high computational complexity and manual annotation
effort. Recent advances in vision-language foundation models open a promising
direction toward training-free approaches. Several studies have explored
leveraging these general-purpose models for fine-grained segmentation,
achieving performance comparable to that of fully supervised, task-specific
models. However, existing methods rely on fixed pipelines that lack the
flexibility needed to adapt to the dynamic nature of the task. To address this
limitation, we propose Multi-Modal Agent, a novel agentic system designed to
solve this task in a more flexible and adaptive manner. Specifically, our
method leverages the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to
generate dynamic workflows tailored to each input. This adaptive procedure
iteratively interacts with a set of specialized tools designed for low-level
tasks across different modalities to identify the target object described by
the multimodal cues. Our agentic approach demonstrates clear improvements over
prior methods on two multimodal-conditioned VOS tasks: RVOS and Ref-AVS.

TL;DR: HumanSense是一个评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在人类中心场景中感知和交互能力的基准测试，揭示了现有模型的不足，并提出改进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏细粒度评估框架来测试MLLMs在理解复杂人类意图和提供共情、上下文感知反馈方面的能力。

Method: 引入HumanSense基准，结合多模态输入（视觉、音频、文本），采用多阶段、模态渐进强化学习增强推理能力。

Result: 领先的MLLMs在高级交互任务中仍有改进空间，多模态输入显著提升性能，推理能力是关键。

Conclusion: 通过上下文分析和推理能力提升，可以显著改善MLLMs在人类中心交互中的表现。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show immense promise for
achieving truly human-like interactions, progress is hindered by the lack of
fine-grained evaluation frameworks for human-centered scenarios, encompassing
both the understanding of complex human intentions and the provision of
empathetic, context-aware responses. Here we introduce HumanSense, a
comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the human-centered perception and
interaction capabilities of MLLMs, with a particular focus on deep
understanding of extended multimodal contexts and the formulation of rational
feedback. Our evaluation reveals that leading MLLMs still have considerable
room for improvement, particularly for advanced interaction-oriented tasks.
Supplementing visual input with audio and text information yields substantial
improvements, and Omni-modal models show advantages on these tasks.
Furthermore, we argue that appropriate feedback stems from a contextual
analysis of the interlocutor's needs and emotions, with reasoning ability
serving as the key to unlocking it. Accordingly, we employ a multi-stage,
modality-progressive reinforcement learning to enhance the reasoning abilities
of an Omni model, achieving substantial gains on evaluation results.
Additionally, we observe that successful reasoning processes exhibit highly
consistent thought patterns. By designing corresponding prompts, we also
enhance the performance of non-reasoning models in a training-free manner.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大气湍流导致图像模糊和几何倾斜，严重影响计算机视觉任务，现有方法难以解决这一问题。

Method: EvTurb通过事件积分减少模糊，利用事件流方差图消除倾斜，采用两步事件引导网络。

Result: 实验表明EvTurb在计算效率下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: EvTurb有效解决了湍流引起的图像失真问题，并提供了首个真实湍流数据集。

Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence degrades image quality by introducing blur and
geometric tilt distortions, posing significant challenges to downstream
computer vision tasks. Existing single-image and multi-frame methods struggle
with the highly ill-posed nature of this problem due to the compositional
complexity of turbulence-induced distortions. To address this, we propose
EvTurb, an event guided turbulence removal framework that leverages high-speed
event streams to decouple blur and tilt effects. EvTurb decouples blur and tilt
effects by modeling event-based turbulence formation, specifically through a
novel two-step event-guided network: event integrals are first employed to
reduce blur in the coarse outputs. This is followed by employing a variance
map, derived from raw event streams, to eliminate the tilt distortion for the
refined outputs. Additionally, we present TurbEvent, the first real-captured
dataset featuring diverse turbulence scenarios. Experimental results
demonstrate that EvTurb surpasses state-of-the-art methods while maintaining
computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于迁移的黑盒攻击方法在自动驾驶场景中攻击效果被高估，且低分辨率数据训练的补丁在高分辨率图像上效果不佳，亟需改进。

Method: 提出P$^3$A框架，包括新指标PASR、损失函数LCSL和预处理方法PSPP，优化高分辨率数据集上的攻击效果。

Result: 实验表明P$^3$A在未见模型和高分辨率数据集上优于现有攻击方法，尤其在PASR指标下表现突出。

Conclusion: P$^3$A显著提升了对抗性补丁攻击的实用性和效果，为自动驾驶安全提供了更可靠的评估方法。

Abstract: Learning-based autonomous driving systems remain critically vulnerable to
adversarial patches, posing serious safety and security risks in their
real-world deployment. Black-box attacks, notable for their high attack success
rate without model knowledge, are especially concerning, with their
transferability extensively studied to reduce computational costs compared to
query-based attacks. Previous transferability-based black-box attacks typically
adopt mean Average Precision (mAP) as the evaluation metric and design training
loss accordingly. However, due to the presence of multiple detected bounding
boxes and the relatively lenient Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds, the
attack effectiveness of these approaches is often overestimated, resulting in
reduced success rates in practical attacking scenarios. Furthermore, patches
trained on low-resolution data often fail to maintain effectiveness on
high-resolution images, limiting their transferability to autonomous driving
datasets. To fill this gap, we propose P$^3$A, a Powerful and Practical Patch
Attack framework for 2D object detection in autonomous driving, specifically
optimized for high-resolution datasets. First, we introduce a novel metric,
Practical Attack Success Rate (PASR), to more accurately quantify attack
effectiveness with greater relevance for pedestrian safety. Second, we present
a tailored Localization-Confidence Suppression Loss (LCSL) to improve attack
transferability under PASR. Finally, to maintain the transferability for
high-resolution datasets, we further incorporate the Probabilistic
Scale-Preserving Padding (PSPP) into the patch attack pipeline as a data
preprocessing step. Extensive experiments show that P$^3$A outperforms
state-of-the-art attacks on unseen models and unseen high-resolution datasets,
both under the proposed practical IoU-based evaluation metric and the previous
mAP-based metrics.

TL;DR: Frequency-Guided Attention (FGA) 是一种轻量级上采样模块，通过傅里叶特征和注意力机制提升单图像超分辨率的高频细节重建能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上采样方法（如子像素卷积）在重建高频细节时表现不佳且易引入混叠伪影，FGA旨在解决这些问题。

Method: FGA结合了傅里叶特征MLP进行频率编码、跨分辨率相关注意力层进行空间对齐，以及频域L1损失进行监督。

Result: 实验显示FGA在五种超分辨率骨干网络上平均PSNR提升0.12~0.14 dB，频域一致性提升29%，尤其在纹理丰富数据集上表现突出。

Conclusion: FGA是一种实用且可扩展的上采样替代方案，能有效减少混叠并保留细节。

Abstract: We propose Frequency-Guided Attention (FGA), a lightweight upsampling module
for single image super-resolution. Conventional upsamplers, such as Sub-Pixel
Convolution, are efficient but frequently fail to reconstruct high-frequency
details and introduce aliasing artifacts. FGA addresses these issues by
integrating (1) a Fourier feature-based Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for
positional frequency encoding, (2) a cross-resolution Correlation Attention
Layer for adaptive spatial alignment, and (3) a frequency-domain L1 loss for
spectral fidelity supervision. Adding merely 0.3M parameters, FGA consistently
enhances performance across five diverse super-resolution backbones in both
lightweight and full-capacity scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate
average PSNR gains of 0.12~0.14 dB and improved frequency-domain consistency by
up to 29%, particularly evident on texture-rich datasets. Visual and spectral
evaluations confirm FGA's effectiveness in reducing aliasing and preserving
fine details, establishing it as a practical, scalable alternative to
traditional upsampling methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Chamfer Guidance方法，通过少量真实样本提升生成数据的多样性和质量，减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生成模型在提升质量时牺牲多样性，以及忽略合成与真实数据分布差异的问题。

Method: 利用少量真实样本（如2或32张）指导生成过程，无需训练，减少计算量。

Result: 在ImageNet-1k和多样性基准测试中表现优异，下游任务准确率提升高达16%。

Conclusion: Chamfer Guidance在保持生成质量的同时显著提升多样性，计算效率高。

Abstract: Conditional image generative models hold considerable promise to produce
infinite amounts of synthetic training data. Yet, recent progress in generation
quality has come at the expense of generation diversity, limiting the utility
of these models as a source of synthetic training data. Although guidance-based
approaches have been introduced to improve the utility of generated data by
focusing on quality or diversity, the (implicit or explicit) utility functions
oftentimes disregard the potential distribution shift between synthetic and
real data. In this work, we introduce Chamfer Guidance: a training-free
guidance approach which leverages a handful of real exemplar images to
characterize the quality and diversity of synthetic data. We show that by
leveraging the proposed Chamfer Guidance, we can boost the diversity of the
generations w.r.t. a dataset of real images while maintaining or improving the
generation quality on ImageNet-1k and standard geo-diversity benchmarks. Our
approach achieves state-of-the-art few-shot performance with as little as 2
exemplar real images, obtaining 96.4\% in terms of precision, and 86.4\% in
terms of distributional coverage, which increase to 97.5\% and 92.7\%,
respectively, when using 32 real images. We showcase the benefits of the
Chamfer Guidance generation by training downstream image classifiers on
synthetic data, achieving accuracy boost of up to 15\% for in-distribution over
the baselines, and up to 16\% in out-of-distribution. Furthermore, our approach
does not require using the unconditional model, and thus obtains a 31\%
reduction in FLOPs w.r.t. classifier-free-guidance-based approaches at sampling
time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型忽略环境传感器的因果信号，依赖单一来源的标注，缺乏交互式场景推理能力。

Method: 构建包含177k图像和152k时间对的多样化数据集，使用GPT-4和Gemini 2.0标注，并基于Qwen-2.5-VL微调。

Result: ChatENV在时间推理和假设推理中表现优异（BERT-F1 0.903），优于现有时间模型。

Conclusion: ChatENV是一个强大的、基于传感器的环境监测工具。

Abstract: Understanding environmental changes from aerial imagery is vital for climate
resilience, urban planning, and ecosystem monitoring. Yet, current vision
language models (VLMs) overlook causal signals from environmental sensors, rely
on single-source captions prone to stylistic bias, and lack interactive
scenario-based reasoning. We present ChatENV, the first interactive VLM that
jointly reasons over satellite image pairs and real-world sensor data. Our
framework: (i) creates a 177k-image dataset forming 152k temporal pairs across
62 land-use classes in 197 countries with rich sensor metadata (e.g.,
temperature, PM10, CO); (ii) annotates data using GPT- 4o and Gemini 2.0 for
stylistic and semantic diversity; and (iii) fine-tunes Qwen-2.5-VL using
efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) adapters for chat purposes. ChatENV
achieves strong performance in temporal and "what-if" reasoning (e.g., BERT-F1
0.903) and rivals or outperforms state-of-the-art temporal models, while
supporting interactive scenario-based analysis. This positions ChatENV as a
powerful tool for grounded, sensor-aware environmental monitoring.

Method: 分析图像采集和处理参数，研究其在视觉表示中的编码方式及其对语义预测的影响。

Result: 发现这些参数会被系统编码，且对语义预测有显著影响，取决于其与语义标签的相关性。

Conclusion: 图像采集和处理参数对视觉编码器的语义预测有重要影响，需在模型设计中加以考虑。

Abstract: Prior work has analyzed the robustness of visual encoders to image
transformations and corruptions, particularly in cases where such alterations
are not seen during training. When this occurs, they introduce a form of
distribution shift at test time, often leading to performance degradation. The
primary focus has been on severe corruptions that, when applied aggressively,
distort useful signals necessary for accurate semantic predictions.
  We take a different perspective by analyzing parameters of the image
acquisition process and transformations that may be subtle or even
imperceptible to the human eye. We find that such parameters are systematically
encoded in the learned visual representations and can be easily recovered. More
strikingly, their presence can have a profound impact, either positively or
negatively, on semantic predictions. This effect depends on whether there is a
strong correlation or anti-correlation between semantic labels and these
acquisition-based or processing-based labels. Our code and data are available

Abstract: This study presents a lameness detection approach that combines pose
estimation and Bidirectional Long-Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) neural networks.
Combining pose-estimation and BLSTMs classifier offers the following
advantages: markerless pose-estimation, elimination of manual feature
engineering by learning temporal motion features from the keypoint
trajectories, and working with short sequences and small training datasets.
Motion sequences of nine keypoints (located on the cows' hooves, head and back)
were extracted from videos of walking cows with the T-LEAP pose estimation
model. The trajectories of the keypoints were then used as an input to a BLSTM
classifier that was trained to perform binary lameness classification. Our
method significantly outperformed an established method that relied on
manually-designed locomotion features: our best architecture achieved a
classification accuracy of 85%, against 80% accuracy for the feature-based
approach. Furthermore, we showed that our BLSTM classifier could detect
lameness with as little as one second of video data.

Result: 在15个基准数据集上的实验表明，SemPT在多种设置下均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: SemPT通过平衡已知类别的区分性和未知类别的可迁移性，有效解决了视觉迁移学习的挑战。

Abstract: Visual transfer learning for unseen categories presents an active research
topic yet a challenging task, due to the inherent conflict between preserving
category-specific representations and acquiring transferable knowledge.
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) pre-trained on large amounts of image-text pairs
offer a promising solution. However, existing prompt tuning methods rely on
sparse category labels or disparate LLM-generated descriptions, which fragment
knowledge representation and hinder transferability. To address this
limitation, we introduce Semantic Prompt Tuning (SemPT), a novel framework that
tackles the generalization challenge by leveraging shared attribute-level
knowledge across categories. Specifically, SemPT adopts a two-step prompting
strategy to guide LLM in extracting shared visual attributes and generating
attribute-level descriptions, capturing transferable semantic cues beyond
labels while ensuring coherent structure. Then, visually guided weighting is
applied to the embeddings of attribute-level descriptions to reduce noise from
irrelevant attributes and enhance the text embeddings. Additionally, image
embeddings are jointly aligned with both label and attribute-enhanced text
embeddings, balancing discrimination for seen categories and transferability to
unseen ones. Considering the availability of category exposure, our inference
dynamically selects between standard label embeddings for seen categories and
attribute-enhanced embeddings for unseen ones to ensure effective adaptation.
Extensive experiments on 15 benchmark datasets demonstrate that SemPT achieves
state-of-the-art performance across various settings, including base-to-novel
generalization, cross-dataset transfer, cross-domain transfer, and few-shot
learning.

Abstract: Unifying multiple multi-modal visual object tracking (MMVOT) tasks draws
increasing attention due to the complementary nature of different modalities in
building robust tracking systems. Existing practices mix all data sensor types
in a single training procedure, structuring a parallel paradigm from the
data-centric perspective and aiming for a global optimum on the joint
distribution of the involved tasks. However, the absence of a unified benchmark
where all types of data coexist forces evaluations on separated benchmarks,
causing \textit{inconsistency} between training and testing, thus leading to
performance \textit{degradation}. To address these issues, this work advances
in two aspects: \ding{182} A unified benchmark, coined as UniBench300, is
introduced to bridge the inconsistency by incorporating multiple task data,
reducing inference passes from three to one and cutting time consumption by
27\%. \ding{183} The unification process is reformulated in a serial format,
progressively integrating new tasks. In this way, the performance degradation
can be specified as knowledge forgetting of previous tasks, which naturally
aligns with the philosophy of continual learning (CL), motivating further
exploration of injecting CL into the unification process. Extensive experiments
conducted on two baselines and four benchmarks demonstrate the significance of
UniBench300 and the superiority of CL in supporting a stable unification
process. Moreover, while conducting dedicated analyses, the performance
degradation is found to be negatively correlated with network capacity.
Additionally, modality discrepancies contribute to varying degradation levels
across tasks (RGBT > RGBD > RGBE in MMVOT), offering valuable insights for
future multi-modal vision research. Source codes and the proposed benchmark is
available at \textit{https://github.com/Zhangyong-Tang/UniBench300}.

Result: AddressVLM在两个数据集上的平均地址定位准确率分别超过其他LVLM模型9%和12%。

Conclusion: AddressVLM通过跨视角对齐和两阶段训练，显著提升了细粒度地址定位能力。

Abstract: Large visual language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
in coarse-grained geo-localization at the country or city level, but they
struggle with fine-grained street-level localization within urban areas. In
this paper, we explore integrating city-wide address localization capabilities
into LVLMs, facilitating flexible address-related question answering using
street-view images. A key challenge is that the street-view visual
question-and-answer (VQA) data provides only microscopic visual cues, leading
to subpar performance in fine-tuned models. To tackle this issue, we
incorporate perspective-invariant satellite images as macro cues and propose
cross-view alignment tuning including a satellite-view and street-view image
grafting mechanism, along with an automatic label generation mechanism. Then
LVLM's global understanding of street distribution is enhanced through
cross-view matching. Our proposed model, named AddressVLM, consists of
two-stage training protocols: cross-view alignment tuning and address
localization tuning. Furthermore, we have constructed two street-view VQA
datasets based on image address localization datasets from Pittsburgh and San
Francisco. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that AddressVLM
outperforms counterpart LVLMs by over 9% and 12% in average address
localization accuracy on these two datasets, respectively.

Conclusion: 混合真实与合成数据的策略有效构建了高质量数据集，验证了方法的优越性。

Abstract: In this paper, we present our approach to the DataCV ICCV Challenge, which
centers on building a high-quality face dataset to train a face recognition
model. The constructed dataset must not contain identities overlapping with any
existing public face datasets. To handle this challenge, we begin with a
thorough cleaning of the baseline HSFace dataset, identifying and removing
mislabeled or inconsistent identities through a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
strategy combining face embedding clustering and GPT-4o-assisted verification.
We retain the largest consistent identity cluster and apply data augmentation
up to a fixed number of images per identity. To further diversify the dataset,
we generate synthetic identities using Stable Diffusion with prompt
engineering. As diffusion models are computationally intensive, we generate
only one reference image per identity and efficiently expand it using Vec2Face,
which rapidly produces 49 identity-consistent variants. This hybrid approach
fuses GAN-based and diffusion-based samples, enabling efficient construction of
a diverse and high-quality dataset. To address the high visual similarity among
synthetic identities, we adopt a curriculum learning strategy by placing them
early in the training schedule, allowing the model to progress from easier to
harder samples. Our final dataset contains 50 images per identity, and all
newly generated identities are checked with mainstream face datasets to ensure
no identity leakage. Our method achieves \textbf{1st place} in the competition,
and experimental results show that our dataset improves model performance
across 10K, 20K, and 100K identity scales. Code is available at

Abstract: In practical application scenarios, moving infrared small target detection
(MIRSTD) remains highly challenging due to the target's small size, weak
intensity, and complex motion pattern. Existing methods typically only model
low-order correlations between feature nodes and perform feature extraction and
enhancement within a single temporal scale. Although hypergraphs have been
widely used for high-order correlation learning, they have received limited
attention in MIRSTD. To explore the potential of hypergraphs and enhance
multi-timescale feature representation, we propose HyperTea, which integrates
global and local temporal perspectives to effectively model high-order
spatiotemporal correlations of features. HyperTea consists of three modules:
the global temporal enhancement module (GTEM) realizes global temporal context
enhancement through semantic aggregation and propagation; the local temporal
enhancement module (LTEM) is designed to capture local motion patterns between
adjacent frames and then enhance local temporal context; additionally, we
further develop a temporal alignment module (TAM) to address potential
cross-scale feature misalignment. To our best knowledge, HyperTea is the first
work to integrate convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural
networks (RNNs), and hypergraph neural networks (HGNNs) for MIRSTD,
significantly improving detection performance. Experiments on DAUB and IRDST
demonstrate its state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Our source codes are

TL;DR: 提出一种联合重建多回波时间（TE）数据的方法，结合隐式神经表示和物理正则化，用于胎儿脑MRI的T2 mapping，减少扫描时间和运动敏感性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胎儿脑MRI中T2 mapping在0.55T中具有潜力，但现有方法因多次采集和运动敏感性导致扫描时间长。

Method: 结合隐式神经表示和物理正则化，联合重建多TE数据，保留解剖和T2定量信息。

Result: 在模拟胎儿脑和成人数据中表现优异，首次实现0.55T胎儿T2 mapping。

Conclusion: 该方法减少每TE所需堆栈数，利用解剖冗余性，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: T2 mapping in fetal brain MRI has the potential to improve characterization
of the developing brain, especially at mid-field (0.55T), where T2 decay is
slower. However, this is challenging as fetal MRI acquisition relies on
multiple motion-corrupted stacks of thick slices, requiring slice-to-volume
reconstruction (SVR) to estimate a high-resolution (HR) 3D volume. Currently,
T2 mapping involves repeated acquisitions of these stacks at each echo time
(TE), leading to long scan times and high sensitivity to motion. We tackle this
challenge with a method that jointly reconstructs data across TEs, addressing
severe motion. Our approach combines implicit neural representations with a
physics-informed regularization that models T2 decay, enabling information
sharing across TEs while preserving anatomical and quantitative T2 fidelity. We
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on simulated fetal brain and in vivo
adult datasets with fetal-like motion. We also present the first in vivo fetal
T2 mapping results at 0.55T. Our study shows potential for reducing the number
of stacks per TE in T2 mapping by leveraging anatomical redundancy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）的FS-IAD方法缺乏工业知识和推理能力，无法媲美专业质检员。

Method: 提出三阶段训练策略：前两阶段学习基础工业知识和差异感知，第三阶段通过上下文学习提升泛化能力；设计图像级和像素级异常评分策略。

Result: IADGPT在异常检测、定位和推理方面表现优异，实验验证了其性能提升。

Conclusion: IADGPT通过模拟人类学习过程，显著提升了FS-IAD的性能，并展示了在工业应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Few-Shot Industrial Anomaly Detection (FS-IAD) has important applications in
automating industrial quality inspection. Recently, some FS-IAD methods based
on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have been proposed with some
achievements through prompt learning or fine-tuning. However, existing LVLMs
focus on general tasks but lack basic industrial knowledge and reasoning
capabilities related to FS-IAD, making these methods far from specialized human
quality inspectors. To address these challenges, we propose a unified
framework, IADGPT, designed to perform FS-IAD in a human-like manner, while
also handling associated localization and reasoning tasks, even for diverse and
novel industrial products. To this end, we introduce a three-stage progressive
training strategy inspired by humans. Specifically, the first two stages
gradually guide IADGPT in acquiring fundamental industrial knowledge and
discrepancy awareness. In the third stage, we design an in-context
learning-based training paradigm, enabling IADGPT to leverage a few-shot image
as the exemplars for improved generalization to novel products. In addition, we
design a strategy that enables IADGPT to output image-level and pixel-level
anomaly scores using the logits output and the attention map, respectively, in
conjunction with the language output to accomplish anomaly reasoning. To
support our training, we present a new dataset comprising 100K images across
400 diverse industrial product categories with extensive attribute-level
textual annotations. Experiments indicate IADGPT achieves considerable
performance gains in anomaly detection and demonstrates competitiveness in
anomaly localization and reasoning. We will release our dataset in
camera-ready.

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级的视图转换框架TUNet，利用预训练扩散模型的高保真生成能力，通过融合策略解决模糊重建问题，实验表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单图像合成新视图任务需要推断3D结构并保持几何一致性，现有方法成本高且效果不佳，因此探索轻量级框架以直接利用预训练模型。

Method: 使用DDIM反演潜在空间，结合相机姿态条件转换U-Net（TUNet）预测目标视图潜在，提出融合策略保留细节，最后通过DDIM采样生成新视图。

Result: 在MVImgNet上的实验表明，该方法在重建质量和泛化能力上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的轻量级框架有效解决了单图像视图合成的模糊和泛化问题，展示了预训练扩散模型的潜力。

Abstract: Synthesizing novel views from a single input image is a challenging task. It
requires extrapolating the 3D structure of a scene while inferring details in
occluded regions, and maintaining geometric consistency across viewpoints. Many
existing methods must fine-tune large diffusion backbones using multiple views
or train a diffusion model from scratch, which is extremely expensive.
Additionally, they suffer from blurry reconstruction and poor generalization.
This gap presents the opportunity to explore an explicit lightweight view
translation framework that can directly utilize the high-fidelity generative
capabilities of a pretrained diffusion model while reconstructing a scene from
a novel view. Given the DDIM-inverted latent of a single input image, we employ
a camera pose-conditioned translation U-Net, TUNet, to predict the inverted
latent corresponding to the desired target view. However, the image sampled
using the predicted latent may result in a blurry reconstruction. To this end,
we propose a novel fusion strategy that exploits the inherent noise correlation
structure observed in DDIM inversion. The proposed fusion strategy helps
preserve the texture and fine-grained details. To synthesize the novel view, we
use the fused latent as the initial condition for DDIM sampling, leveraging the
generative prior of the pretrained diffusion model. Extensive experiments on
MVImgNet demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods.

*Zhanwen Liu,Yujing Sun,Yang Wang,Nan Yang,Shengbo Eben Li,Xiangmo Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合事件相机和RGB相机的方法（MCFNet），通过动态范围信息和自适应特征融合，显著提升了复杂交通场景下的目标检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RGB相机在复杂交通环境（如夜间驾驶、隧道）中动态范围受限，导致全局对比度下降和高频细节丢失，影响目标检测性能。

Method: 提出MCFNet，包括事件校正模块（ECM）进行时间对齐，事件动态上采样模块（EDUM）提升空间分辨率，以及跨模态融合模块（CMM）实现自适应特征融合。

Result: 在DSEC-Det和PKU-DAVIS-SOD数据集上，MCFNet显著优于现有方法，DSEC-Det上mAP50提升7.4%，mAP提升1.7%。

Conclusion: MCFNet通过结合事件相机和RGB相机，有效解决了复杂光照下的目标检测问题，性能显著提升。

Abstract: The dynamic range limitation of conventional RGB cameras reduces global
contrast and causes loss of high-frequency details such as textures and edges
in complex traffic environments (e.g., nighttime driving, tunnels), hindering
discriminative feature extraction and degrading frame-based object detection.
To address this, we integrate a bio-inspired event camera with an RGB camera to
provide high dynamic range information and propose a motion cue fusion network
(MCFNet), which achieves optimal spatiotemporal alignment and adaptive
cross-modal feature fusion under challenging lighting. Specifically, an event
correction module (ECM) temporally aligns asynchronous event streams with image
frames via optical-flow-based warping, jointly optimized with the detection
network to learn task-aware event representations. The event dynamic upsampling
module (EDUM) enhances spatial resolution of event frames to match image
structures, ensuring precise spatiotemporal alignment. The cross-modal mamba
fusion module (CMM) uses adaptive feature fusion with a novel interlaced
scanning mechanism, effectively integrating complementary information for
robust detection. Experiments conducted on the DSEC-Det and PKU-DAVIS-SOD
datasets demonstrate that MCFNet significantly outperforms existing methods in
various poor lighting and fast moving traffic scenarios. Notably, on the
DSEC-Det dataset, MCFNet achieves a remarkable improvement, surpassing the best
existing methods by 7.4% in mAP50 and 1.7% in mAP metrics, respectively. The
code is available at https://github.com/Charm11492/MCFNet.

TL;DR: 论文提出CountCluster方法，通过聚类对象交叉注意力图来改进扩散模型生成图像中对象数量的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在生成图像时难以准确反映输入提示中的对象数量，且现有方法依赖外部模块或忽视早期去噪步骤的关键性。

Method: CountCluster在推理时根据注意力分数将对象交叉注意力图划分为k个聚类，并优化潜在空间以对齐目标分布。

Result: 方法在对象数量准确性上平均提升18.5%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CountCluster无需外部工具或额外训练，显著提升了扩散模型生成图像中对象数量的控制能力。

Abstract: Diffusion-based text-to-image generation models have demonstrated strong
performance in terms of image quality and diversity. However, they still
struggle to generate images that accurately reflect the number of objects
specified in the input prompt. Several approaches have been proposed that rely
on either external counting modules for iterative refinement or quantity
representations derived from learned tokens or latent features. However, they
still have limitations in accurately reflecting the specified number of objects
and overlook an important structural characteristic--The number of object
instances in the generated image is largely determined in the early timesteps
of the denoising process. To correctly reflect the object quantity for image
generation, the highly activated regions in the object cross-attention map at
the early timesteps should match the input object quantity, while each region
should be clearly separated. To address this issue, we propose
\textit{CountCluster}, a method that guides the object cross-attention map to
be clustered according to the specified object count in the input, without
relying on any external tools or additional training. The proposed method
partitions the object cross-attention map into $k$ clusters at inference time
based on attention scores, defines an ideal distribution in which each cluster
is spatially well-separated, and optimizes the latent to align with this target
distribution. Our method achieves an average improvement of 18.5\%p in object
count accuracy compared to existing methods, and demonstrates superior quantity
control performance across a variety of prompts. Code will be released at:

Conclusion: 神经网络方法为卫星上的实时SAR数据处理提供了可行方案，显著减少了数据下传需求。

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data enables large-scale surveillance of
maritime vessels. However, near-real-time monitoring is currently constrained
by the need to downlink all raw data, perform image focusing, and subsequently
analyze it on the ground. On-board processing to generate higher-level products
could reduce the data volume that needs to be downlinked, alleviating bandwidth
constraints and minimizing latency. However, traditional image focusing and
processing algorithms face challenges due to the satellite's limited memory,
processing power, and computational resources. This work proposes and evaluates
neural networks designed for real-time inference on unfocused SAR data acquired
in Stripmap and Interferometric Wide (IW) modes captured with Sentinel-1. Our
results demonstrate the feasibility of using one of our models for on-board
processing and deployment on an FPGA. Additionally, by investigating a binary
classification task between ships and windmills, we demonstrate that target
classification is possible.

Abstract: Cross-view localization aims to estimate the 3 degrees of freedom pose of a
ground-view image by registering it to aerial or satellite imagery. It is
essential in GNSS-denied environments such as urban canyons and disaster zones.
Existing methods either regress poses directly or align features in a shared
bird's-eye view (BEV) space, both built upon accurate spatial correspondences
between perspectives. However, these methods fail to establish strict
cross-view correspondences, yielding only coarse or geometrically inconsistent
matches. Consequently, fine-grained image matching between ground and aerial
views remains an unsolved problem, which in turn constrains the
interpretability of localization results. In this paper, we revisit cross-view
localization from the perspective of cross-view image matching and propose a
novel framework that improves both matching and localization. Specifically, we
introduce a Surface Model to model visible regions for accurate BEV projection,
and a SimRefiner module to refine the similarity matrix through local-global
residual correction, eliminating the reliance on post-processing like RANSAC.
To further support research in this area, we introduce CVFM, the first
benchmark with 32,509 cross-view image pairs annotated with pixel-level
correspondences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
substantially improves both localization accuracy and image matching quality,
setting new baselines under extreme viewpoint disparity.

Method: 提出DCPE方法，采用基于实例的距离替代传统的基于质心的距离，并使用凝聚合并技术解决标记空间差异问题。

Result: DCPE在LlamaGen-B上加速训练42%，并提高了FID和IS性能。

Conclusion: DCPE是一种即插即用的方法，能有效挖掘和利用代码本中的先验信息，提升自回归模型的训练效率和生成质量。

Abstract: Advanced discrete token-based autoregressive image generation systems first
tokenize images into sequences of token indices with a codebook, and then model
these sequences in an autoregressive paradigm. While autoregressive generative
models are trained only on index values, the prior encoded in the codebook,
which contains rich token similarity information, is not exploited. Recent
studies have attempted to incorporate this prior by performing naive k-means
clustering on the tokens, helping to facilitate the training of generative
models with a reduced codebook. However, we reveal that k-means clustering
performs poorly in the codebook feature space due to inherent issues, including
token space disparity and centroid distance inaccuracy. In this work, we
propose the Discriminative Codebook Prior Extractor (DCPE) as an alternative to
k-means clustering for more effectively mining and utilizing the token
similarity information embedded in the codebook. DCPE replaces the commonly
used centroid-based distance, which is found to be unsuitable and inaccurate
for the token feature space, with a more reasonable instance-based distance.
Using an agglomerative merging technique, it further addresses the token space
disparity issue by avoiding splitting high-density regions and aggregating
low-density ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DCPE is plug-and-play
and integrates seamlessly with existing codebook prior-based paradigms. With
the discriminative prior extracted, DCPE accelerates the training of
autoregressive models by 42% on LlamaGen-B and improves final FID and IS
performance.

Method: 构建EgoCross基准，涵盖四个挑战性领域（如手术、极限运动），包含约1,000个QA对，支持OpenQA和CloseQA格式。

Result: 实验表明现有MLLMs在非日常生活领域泛化能力有限。通过微调和强化学习探索改进方法。

Conclusion: EgoCross为推进领域自适应、鲁棒的自我中心视频理解提供了基础，数据和代码已开源。

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
significantly pushed the frontier of egocentric video question answering
(EgocentricQA). However, existing benchmarks and studies are mainly limited to
common daily activities such as cooking and cleaning. In contrast, real-world
deployment inevitably encounters domain shifts, where target domains differ
substantially in both visual style and semantic content. To bridge this gap, we
introduce \textbf{EgoCross}, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the
cross-domain generalization of MLLMs in EgocentricQA. EgoCross covers four
diverse and challenging domains, including surgery, industry, extreme sports,
and animal perspective, representing realistic and high-impact application
scenarios. It comprises approximately 1,000 QA pairs across 798 video clips,
spanning four key QA tasks: prediction, recognition, localization, and
counting. Each QA pair provides both OpenQA and CloseQA formats to support
fine-grained evaluation. Extensive experiments show that most existing MLLMs,
whether general-purpose or egocentric-specialized, struggle to generalize to
domains beyond daily life, highlighting the limitations of current models.
Furthermore, we conduct several pilot studies, \eg, fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning, to explore potential improvements. We hope EgoCross and
our accompanying analysis will serve as a foundation for advancing
domain-adaptive, robust egocentric video understanding. Data and codes will be

Abstract: Human perceptual systems excel at inducing and recognizing objects across
both known and novel categories, a capability far beyond current machine
learning frameworks. While generalized category discovery (GCD) aims to bridge
this gap, existing methods predominantly focus on optimizing objective
functions. We present an orthogonal solution, inspired by the human cognitive
process for novel object understanding: decomposing objects into visual
primitives and establishing cross-knowledge comparisons. We propose ConGCD,
which establishes primitive-oriented representations through high-level
semantic reconstruction, binding intra-class shared attributes via
deconstruction. Mirroring human preference diversity in visual processing,
where distinct individuals leverage dominant or contextual cues, we implement
dominant and contextual consensus units to capture class-discriminative
patterns and inherent distributional invariants, respectively. A consensus
scheduler dynamically optimizes activation pathways, with final predictions
emerging through multiplex consensus integration. Extensive evaluations across
coarse- and fine-grained benchmarks demonstrate ConGCD's effectiveness as a
consensus-aware paradigm. Code is available at github.com/lytang63/ConGCD.

Abstract: This paper presents a summary of the 2025 Sclera Segmentation Benchmarking
Competition (SSBC), which focused on the development of privacy-preserving
sclera-segmentation models trained using synthetically generated ocular images.
The goal of the competition was to evaluate how well models trained on
synthetic data perform in comparison to those trained on real-world datasets.
The competition featured two tracks: $(i)$ one relying solely on synthetic data
for model development, and $(ii)$ one combining/mixing synthetic with (a
limited amount of) real-world data. A total of nine research groups submitted
diverse segmentation models, employing a variety of architectural designs,
including transformer-based solutions, lightweight models, and segmentation
networks guided by generative frameworks. Experiments were conducted across
three evaluation datasets containing both synthetic and real-world images,
collected under diverse conditions. Results show that models trained entirely
on synthetic data can achieve competitive performance, particularly when
dedicated training strategies are employed, as evidenced by the top performing
models that achieved $F_1$ scores of over $0.8$ in the synthetic data track.
Moreover, performance gains in the mixed track were often driven more by
methodological choices rather than by the inclusion of real data, highlighting
the promise of synthetic data for privacy-aware biometric development. The code

Abstract: Symmetry is a fundamental concept that has been extensively studied, yet
detecting it in complex scenes remains a significant challenge in computer
vision. Recent heatmap-based approaches can localize potential regions of
symmetry axes but often lack precision in identifying individual axes. In this
work, we propose a novel framework for axis-level detection of the two most
common symmetry types-reflection and rotation-by representing them as explicit
geometric primitives, i.e. lines and points. Our method employs a dual-branch
architecture that is equivariant to the dihedral group, with each branch
specialized to exploit the structure of dihedral group-equivariant features for
its respective symmetry type. For reflection symmetry, we introduce
orientational anchors, aligned with group components, to enable
orientation-specific detection, and a reflectional matching that measures
similarity between patterns and their mirrored counterparts across candidate
axes. For rotational symmetry, we propose a rotational matching that compares
patterns at fixed angular intervals to identify rotational centers. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance,
outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: The emergence of deepfake technology has introduced a range of societal
problems, garnering considerable attention. Current deepfake detection methods
perform well on specific datasets, but exhibit poor performance when applied to
datasets with unknown forgery techniques. Moreover, as the gap between emerging
and traditional forgery techniques continues to widen, cross-domain detection
methods that rely on common forgery traces are becoming increasingly
ineffective. This situation highlights the urgency of developing deepfake
detection technology with strong generalization to cope with fast iterative
forgery techniques. To address these challenges, we propose a Forgery Guided
Learning (FGL) strategy designed to enable detection networks to continuously
adapt to unknown forgery techniques. Specifically, the FGL strategy captures
the differential information between known and unknown forgery techniques,
allowing the model to dynamically adjust its learning process in real time. To
further improve the ability to perceive forgery traces, we design a Dual
Perception Network (DPNet) that captures both differences and relationships
among forgery traces. In the frequency stream, the network dynamically
perceives and extracts discriminative features across various forgery
techniques, establishing essential detection cues. These features are then
integrated with spatial features and projected into the embedding space. In
addition, graph convolution is employed to perceive relationships across the
entire feature space, facilitating a more comprehensive understanding of
forgery trace correlations. Extensive experiments show that our approach
generalizes well across different scenarios and effectively handles unknown
forgery challenges, providing robust support for deepfake detection. Our code
is available on https://github.com/vpsg-research/FGL.

TL;DR: DARC是一种新颖的模型驱动群体配准框架，用于高效构建无偏的、高保真度的医学图像图谱，并支持多种应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据驱动方法在大规模3D数据集上存在训练依赖、泛化性差和缺乏推理阶段的问题，而模型驱动方法虽数据高效但面临可扩展性和优化挑战。

Method: DARC采用坐标下降策略和中心性激活函数，支持多种图像相似性度量，高效处理任意数量的3D图像。

Result: DARC在一次性分割和形状合成应用中表现优异，超越现有少样本方法。

Conclusion: DARC为图谱构建和应用提供了灵活、通用且资源高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Atlas construction is fundamental to medical image analysis, offering a
standardized spatial reference for tasks such as population-level anatomical
modeling. While data-driven registration methods have recently shown promise in
pairwise settings, their reliance on large training datasets, limited
generalizability, and lack of true inference phases in groupwise contexts
hinder their practical use. In contrast, model-driven methods offer
training-free, theoretically grounded, and data-efficient alternatives, though
they often face scalability and optimization challenges when applied to large
3D datasets. In this work, we introduce DARC (Diffeomorphic Atlas Registration
via Coordinate descent), a novel model-driven groupwise registration framework
for atlas construction. DARC supports a broad range of image dissimilarity
metrics and efficiently handles arbitrary numbers of 3D images without
incurring GPU memory issues. Through a coordinate descent strategy and a
centrality-enforcing activation function, DARC produces unbiased, diffeomorphic
atlases with high anatomical fidelity. Beyond atlas construction, we
demonstrate two key applications: (1) One-shot segmentation, where labels
annotated only on the atlas are propagated to subjects via inverse
deformations, outperforming state-of-the-art few-shot methods; and (2) shape
synthesis, where new anatomical variants are generated by warping the atlas
mesh using synthesized diffeomorphic deformation fields. Overall, DARC offers a
flexible, generalizable, and resource-efficient framework for atlas
construction and applications.

TL;DR: 论文分析了主流视觉语言模型在时空物理推理任务上的不足，提出了一种改进方法，并展示了其效果，但指出模型在新物理场景中的泛化能力仍有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时空物理推理是理解真实物理世界的基础能力，但现有视觉语言模型在此任务上的表现尚未充分探索。

Method: 采用监督微调结合基于规则的强化学习对Qwen2.5-VL-7B模型进行改进。

Result: 改进后的模型在时空物理推理能力上显著提升，超越了领先的专有模型。

Conclusion: 尽管取得了进展，模型在新物理场景中的泛化能力仍有限，需要进一步研究新方法。

Abstract: Spatio-physical reasoning, a foundation capability for understanding the real
physics world, is a critical step towards building robust world models. While
recent vision language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable progress in
specialized domains like multimodal mathematics and pure spatial understanding,
their capability for spatio-physical reasoning remains largely unexplored. This
paper provides a comprehensive diagnostic analysis of mainstream VLMs,
revealing that current models perform inadequately on this crucial task.
Further detailed analysis shows that this underperformance is largely
attributable to biases caused by human-like prior and a lack of deep reasoning.
To address these challenges, we apply supervised fine-tuning followed by
rule-based reinforcement learning to Qwen2.5-VL-7B, resulting in significant
improvements in spatio-physical reasoning capabilities and surpassing leading
proprietary models. Nevertheless, despite this success, the model's
generalization to new physics scenarios remains limited -- underscoring the
pressing need for new approaches in spatio-physical reasoning.

TL;DR: AEGIS是一个新的大规模基准数据集，用于检测高度逼真的AI生成视频，填补了现有检测方法的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成内容的发展带来了高度逼真的合成视频，对社会信任和数字完整性构成威胁，现有检测基准在真实性、规模和复杂性上不足。

Method: AEGIS包含10,000多个精心策划的真实和合成视频，涵盖多种先进生成模型，并提供多模态注释。

Result: 实验表明，现有视觉语言模型在AEGIS最具挑战性的子集上检测能力有限。

Conclusion: AEGIS为开发更鲁棒、可靠的视频真实性检测方法提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-generated content have fueled the rise of highly
realistic synthetic videos, posing severe risks to societal trust and digital
integrity. Existing benchmarks for video authenticity detection typically
suffer from limited realism, insufficient scale, and inadequate complexity,
failing to effectively evaluate modern vision-language models against
sophisticated forgeries. To address this critical gap, we introduce AEGIS, a
novel large-scale benchmark explicitly targeting the detection of
hyper-realistic and semantically nuanced AI-generated videos. AEGIS comprises
over 10,000 rigorously curated real and synthetic videos generated by diverse,
state-of-the-art generative models, including Stable Video Diffusion,
CogVideoX-5B, KLing, and Sora, encompassing open-source and proprietary
architectures. In particular, AEGIS features specially constructed challenging
subsets enhanced with robustness evaluation. Furthermore, we provide multimodal
annotations spanning Semantic-Authenticity Descriptions, Motion Features, and
Low-level Visual Features, facilitating authenticity detection and supporting
downstream tasks such as multimodal fusion and forgery localization. Extensive
experiments using advanced vision-language models demonstrate limited detection
capabilities on the most challenging subsets of AEGIS, highlighting the
dataset's unique complexity and realism beyond the current generalization
capabilities of existing models. In essence, AEGIS establishes an indispensable
evaluation benchmark, fundamentally advancing research toward developing
genuinely robust, reliable, broadly generalizable video authenticity detection
methodologies capable of addressing real-world forgery threats. Our dataset is

TL;DR: BLADE提出了一种数据无关的联合训练框架，结合自适应块稀疏注意力机制和稀疏感知的步蒸馏范式，显著提升了视频生成模型的推理速度和生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器在高质量视频生成中表现优异，但其迭代去噪过程慢且长序列的二次注意力成本高，导致推理瓶颈。现有加速策略（如步蒸馏和稀疏注意力）单独使用效果有限，联合使用又面临训练和数据成本高的挑战。

Method: BLADE框架包含自适应块稀疏注意力（ASA）机制和基于轨迹分布匹配（TDM）的稀疏感知步蒸馏范式，动态生成内容感知的稀疏掩码并直接整合稀疏性到蒸馏过程中。

Result: 在CogVideoX-5B和Wan2.1-1.3B模型上，BLADE分别实现了8.89x和14.10x的端到端推理加速，并在VBench-2.0基准测试中显著提升了生成质量。

Conclusion: BLADE通过创新的联合训练框架，有效解决了视频生成模型的推理瓶颈，同时提升了生成质量和效率。

Abstract: Diffusion transformers currently lead the field in high-quality video
generation, but their slow iterative denoising process and prohibitive
quadratic attention costs for long sequences create significant inference
bottlenecks. While both step distillation and sparse attention mechanisms have
shown promise as independent acceleration strategies, effectively combining
these approaches presents critical challenges -- training-free integration
yields suboptimal results, while separately training sparse attention after
step distillation requires prohibitively expensive high-quality video data. To
overcome these limitations, we propose BLADE, an innovative data-free joint
training framework that introduces: (1) an Adaptive Block-Sparse Attention
(ASA) mechanism for dynamically generating content-aware sparsity masks to
focus computation on salient spatiotemporal features, and (2) a sparsity-aware
step distillation paradigm built upon Trajectory Distribution Matching (TDM)
that directly incorporates sparsity into the distillation process rather than
treating it as a separate compression step, with fast convergence. We validate
BLADE on text-to-video models like CogVideoX-5B and Wan2.1-1.3B. Our framework
demonstrates remarkable efficiency gains across different scales. On
Wan2.1-1.3B, BLADE achieves a 14.10x end-to-end inference acceleration over a
50-step baseline. Moreover, on models such as CogVideoX-5B with short video
sequence lengths, our framework delivers a robust 8.89x speedup. Crucially, the
acceleration is accompanied by a consistent quality improvement. On the
VBench-2.0 benchmark, BLADE boosts the score of CogVideoX-5B to 0.569 (from
0.534) and Wan2.1-1.3B to 0.570 (from 0.563), results that are further
corroborated by superior ratings in human evaluations. Our code and model
weights are publicly available at: http://ziplab.co/BLADE-Homepage/.

TL;DR: 提出TriFlowSR框架，解决现有RefSR方法在信息对齐和数据集质量上的不足，并引入首个UHD RefSR数据集Landmark-4K。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于ControlNet的RefSR方法难以有效对齐LR和参考HR图像信息，且数据集分辨率低、质量差，导致参考图像缺乏细节。

Method: 设计TriFlowSR框架，通过显式模式匹配策略（Reference Matching Strategy）对齐LR和参考HR图像，并构建Landmark-4K数据集支持UHD场景。

Result: 实验表明TriFlowSR能更有效利用参考HR图像的语义和纹理信息，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TriFlowSR是首个针对UHD场景的基于扩散的RefSR方法，解决了真实世界退化问题。

Abstract: Reference-based Image Super-Resolution (RefSR) aims to restore a
low-resolution (LR) image by utilizing the semantic and texture information
from an additional reference high-resolution (reference HR) image. Existing
diffusion-based RefSR methods are typically built upon ControlNet, which
struggles to effectively align the information between the LR image and the
reference HR image. Moreover, current RefSR datasets suffer from limited
resolution and poor image quality, resulting in the reference images lacking
sufficient fine-grained details to support high-quality restoration. To
overcome the limitations above, we propose TriFlowSR, a novel framework that
explicitly achieves pattern matching between the LR image and the reference HR
image. Meanwhile, we introduce Landmark-4K, the first RefSR dataset for
Ultra-High-Definition (UHD) landmark scenarios. Considering the UHD scenarios
with real-world degradation, in TriFlowSR, we design a Reference Matching
Strategy to effectively match the LR image with the reference HR image.
Experimental results show that our approach can better utilize the semantic and
texture information of the reference HR image compared to previous methods. To
the best of our knowledge, we propose the first diffusion-based RefSR pipeline
for ultra-high definition landmark scenarios under real-world degradation. Our
code and model will be available at https://github.com/nkicsl/TriFlowSR.

Motivation: 传统被动活体检测方法难以应对多种攻击（如打印照片、屏幕显示等），需要更主动且可靠的检测手段。

Method: 设计用户交互场景（面部缓慢接近摄像头），结合光流分析和神经网络分类器处理时空特征。

Result: 显著提升了活体检测的准确性，能够有效区分真实面部与多种攻击类型。

Conclusion: 该方法通过主动交互和光流分析，为活体检测提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we proposed a novel cooperative video-based face liveness
detection method based on a new user interaction scenario where participants
are instructed to slowly move their frontal-oriented face closer to the camera.
This controlled approaching face protocol, combined with optical flow analysis,
represents the core innovation of our approach. By designing a system where
users follow this specific movement pattern, we enable robust extraction of
facial volume information through neural optical flow estimation, significantly
improving discrimination between genuine faces and various presentation attacks
(including printed photos, screen displays, masks, and video replays). Our
method processes both the predicted optical flows and RGB frames through a
neural classifier, effectively leveraging spatial-temporal features for more
reliable liveness detection compared to passive methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于标注数据稀缺且传统方法在血管分割中表现不佳，需要一种能有效利用无标签数据并提升血管表征的方法。

Method: VasoMIM结合解剖学知识，包括解剖引导的掩蔽策略和解剖一致性损失，以优化血管区域的表示学习。

Result: 在三个数据集上实现了最先进的性能，证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: VasoMIM为X射线血管造影分析提供了潜在的高效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate vessel segmentation in X-ray angiograms is crucial for numerous
clinical applications. However, the scarcity of annotated data presents a
significant challenge, which has driven the adoption of self-supervised
learning (SSL) methods such as masked image modeling (MIM) to leverage
large-scale unlabeled data for learning transferable representations.
Unfortunately, conventional MIM often fails to capture vascular anatomy because
of the severe class imbalance between vessel and background pixels, leading to
weak vascular representations. To address this, we introduce Vascular
anatomy-aware Masked Image Modeling (VasoMIM), a novel MIM framework tailored
for X-ray angiograms that explicitly integrates anatomical knowledge into the
pre-training process. Specifically, it comprises two complementary components:
anatomy-guided masking strategy and anatomical consistency loss. The former
preferentially masks vessel-containing patches to focus the model on
reconstructing vessel-relevant regions. The latter enforces consistency in
vascular semantics between the original and reconstructed images, thereby
improving the discriminability of vascular representations. Empirically,
VasoMIM achieves state-of-the-art performance across three datasets. These
findings highlight its potential to facilitate X-ray angiogram analysis.

Motivation: 现有扩散模型在遥感图像生成中难以捕捉形态细节，影响检测模型的鲁棒性。

Method: 提取对象形状先验，引入双分支扩散模型和扩散一致性损失，使用DDPO优化生成过程。

Result: OF-Diff在多项指标上优于现有方法，特别是多态和小物体类别性能显著提升（如飞机mAP提高8.3%）。

Conclusion: OF-Diff有效提升了遥感图像生成的保真度和多样性，为对象检测提供了更可靠的数据。

Abstract: High-precision controllable remote sensing image generation is both
meaningful and challenging. Existing diffusion models often produce
low-fidelity images due to their inability to adequately capture morphological
details, which may affect the robustness and reliability of object detection
models. To enhance the accuracy and fidelity of generated objects in remote
sensing, this paper proposes Object Fidelity Diffusion (OF-Diff), which
effectively improves the fidelity of generated objects. Specifically, we are
the first to extract the prior shapes of objects based on the layout for
diffusion models in remote sensing. Then, we introduce a dual-branch diffusion
model with diffusion consistency loss, which can generate high-fidelity remote
sensing images without providing real images during the sampling phase.
Furthermore, we introduce DDPO to fine-tune the diffusion process, making the
generated remote sensing images more diverse and semantically consistent.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that OF-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in the remote sensing across key quality metrics. Notably, the
performance of several polymorphic and small object classes shows significant
improvement. For instance, the mAP increases by 8.3%, 7.7%, and 4.0% for
airplanes, ships, and vehicles, respectively.

Abstract: We present UI-Venus, a native UI agent that takes only screenshots as input
based on a multimodal large language model. UI-Venus achieves SOTA performance
on both UI grounding and navigation tasks using only several hundred thousand
high-quality training samples through reinforcement finetune (RFT) based on

planing ability, we also evaluate it on the AndroidWorld, an online UI
navigation arena, on which our 7B and 72B variants achieve 49.1% and 65.9%

Motivation: 当前自监督立体匹配依赖光度一致性假设，但在遮挡区域因对应关系不明确而失效。

Method: 采用教师-学生范式，利用多基线输入，教师和学生的输入共享参考视图但目标视图不同。教师预测被缩放以匹配学生基线并监督学生，同时引入遮挡感知注意力图。

Conclusion: BaCon-Stereo通过对比学习和多基线输入有效解决了遮挡问题，具有强泛化性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Current self-supervised stereo matching relies on the photometric consistency
assumption, which breaks down in occluded regions due to ill-posed
correspondences. To address this issue, we propose BaCon-Stereo, a simple yet
effective contrastive learning framework for self-supervised stereo network
training in both non-occluded and occluded regions. We adopt a teacher-student
paradigm with multi-baseline inputs, in which the stereo pairs fed into the
teacher and student share the same reference view but differ in target views.
Geometrically, regions occluded in the student's target view are often visible
in the teacher's, making it easier for the teacher to predict in these regions.
The teacher's prediction is rescaled to match the student's baseline and then
used to supervise the student. We also introduce an occlusion-aware attention
map to better guide the student in learning occlusion completion. To support
training, we synthesize a multi-baseline dataset BaCon-20k. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that BaCon-Stereo improves prediction in both occluded
and non-occluded regions, achieves strong generalization and robustness, and
outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised methods on both KITTI 2015 and
2012 benchmarks. Our code and dataset will be released upon paper acceptance.

Conclusion: AdaptFED扩展了焦点调制在联邦学习中的应用，为更自适应、可扩展和通用的基于Transformer的联邦系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has proven essential for privacy-preserving,
collaborative training across distributed clients. Our prior work, TransFed,
introduced a robust transformer-based FL framework that leverages a
learn-to-adapt hypernetwork to generate personalized focal modulation layers
per client, outperforming traditional methods in non-IID and cross-domain
settings. In this extended version, we propose AdaptFED, where we deepen the
investigation of focal modulation in generalizable FL by incorporating: (1) a
refined adaptation strategy that integrates task-aware client embeddings to
personalize modulation dynamics further, (2) enhanced theoretical bounds on
adaptation performance, and (3) broader empirical validation across additional
modalities, including time-series and multilingual data. We also introduce an
efficient variant of TransFed that reduces server-client communication overhead
via low-rank hypernetwork conditioning, enabling scalable deployment in
resource-constrained environments. Extensive experiments on eight diverse
datasets reaffirm the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art
baselines, particularly in source-free and cross-task federated setups. Our
findings not only extend the capabilities of focal modulation in FL but also
pave the way for more adaptive, scalable, and generalizable transformer-based

Motivation: 现有视频生成技术难以满足物理规律的要求，限制了真实感和准确性。

Result: 实验表明PhysHPO显著提升了视频生成的物理合理性和整体质量。

Conclusion: PhysHPO为更真实和符合人类偏好的视频生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation have enabled the creation of
high-quality, visually compelling videos. However, generating videos that
adhere to the laws of physics remains a critical challenge for applications
requiring realism and accuracy. In this work, we propose PhysHPO, a novel
framework for Hierarchical Cross-Modal Direct Preference Optimization, to
tackle this challenge by enabling fine-grained preference alignment for
physically plausible video generation. PhysHPO optimizes video alignment across
four hierarchical granularities: a) Instance Level, aligning the overall video
content with the input prompt; b) State Level, ensuring temporal consistency
using boundary frames as anchors; c) Motion Level, modeling motion trajectories
for realistic dynamics; and d) Semantic Level, maintaining logical consistency
between narrative and visuals. Recognizing that real-world videos are the best
reflections of physical phenomena, we further introduce an automated data
selection pipeline to efficiently identify and utilize "good data" from
existing large-scale text-video datasets, thereby eliminating the need for
costly and time-intensive dataset construction. Extensive experiments on both
physics-focused and general capability benchmarks demonstrate that PhysHPO
significantly improves physical plausibility and overall video generation
quality of advanced models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
work to explore fine-grained preference alignment and data selection for video
generation, paving the way for more realistic and human-preferred video
generation paradigms.

TL;DR: 研究评估了GPT系列模型在脑肿瘤视觉问答任务中的表现，发现GPT-5-mini表现最佳，但整体准确率仍不足以用于临床。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确区分脑肿瘤类型对治疗规划至关重要，研究探索了大型语言模型在结合影像与自然语言推理任务中的潜力。

Method: 使用BraTS数据集中的多序列MRI和临床特征构建VQA基准，评估GPT-4o、GPT-5-nano、GPT-5-mini和GPT-5在零样本链式推理任务中的表现。

Result: GPT-5-mini以44.19%的准确率领先，但各模型在不同肿瘤亚型中表现不一，整体准确率未达临床标准。

Conclusion: GPT-5系列模型在结构化神经肿瘤VQA任务中表现中等，但尚不适合临床使用。

Abstract: Accurate differentiation of brain tumor types on magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) is critical for guiding treatment planning in neuro-oncology. Recent
advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled visual question answering
(VQA) approaches that integrate image interpretation with natural language
reasoning. In this study, we evaluated GPT-4o, GPT-5-nano, GPT-5-mini, and
GPT-5 on a curated brain tumor VQA benchmark derived from 3 Brain Tumor
Segmentation (BraTS) datasets - glioblastoma (GLI), meningioma (MEN), and brain
metastases (MET). Each case included multi-sequence MRI triplanar mosaics and
structured clinical features transformed into standardized VQA items. Models
were assessed in a zero-shot chain-of-thought setting for accuracy on both
visual and reasoning tasks. Results showed that GPT-5-mini achieved the highest
macro-average accuracy (44.19%), followed by GPT-5 (43.71%), GPT-4o (41.49%),
and GPT-5-nano (35.85%). Performance varied by tumor subtype, with no single
model dominating across all cohorts. These findings suggest that GPT-5 family
models can achieve moderate accuracy in structured neuro-oncological VQA tasks,
but not at a level acceptable for clinical use.

TL;DR: ToonComposer是一个生成模型，将动画制作的中间帧生成和上色阶段统一为一个后关键帧阶段，减少人工工作量并提高灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统动画制作需要大量手动操作，现有AI方法分阶段处理导致错误累积和伪影。ToonComposer旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 采用稀疏草图注入机制和卡通适配方法，结合现代视频基础模型，支持单草图和多草图输入。

Result: 在视觉质量、运动一致性和生产效率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ToonComposer为AI辅助动画制作提供了更优且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Traditional cartoon and anime production involves keyframing, inbetweening,
and colorization stages, which require intensive manual effort. Despite recent
advances in AI, existing methods often handle these stages separately, leading
to error accumulation and artifacts. For instance, inbetweening approaches
struggle with large motions, while colorization methods require dense per-frame
sketches. To address this, we introduce ToonComposer, a generative model that
unifies inbetweening and colorization into a single post-keyframing stage.
ToonComposer employs a sparse sketch injection mechanism to provide precise
control using keyframe sketches. Additionally, it uses a cartoon adaptation
method with the spatial low-rank adapter to tailor a modern video foundation
model to the cartoon domain while keeping its temporal prior intact. Requiring
as few as a single sketch and a colored reference frame, ToonComposer excels
with sparse inputs, while also supporting multiple sketches at any temporal
location for more precise motion control. This dual capability reduces manual
workload and improves flexibility, empowering artists in real-world scenarios.
To evaluate our model, we further created PKBench, a benchmark featuring
human-drawn sketches that simulate real-world use cases. Our evaluation
demonstrates that ToonComposer outperforms existing methods in visual quality,
motion consistency, and production efficiency, offering a superior and more
flexible solution for AI-assisted cartoon production.

TL;DR: STream3R是一种基于Transformer的3D重建方法，通过因果注意力处理图像序列，高效且适用于动态场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多视图重建方法依赖昂贵的全局优化或简单内存机制，难以处理长序列。STream3R旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 采用解码器Transformer框架，利用因果注意力处理图像序列，并从大规模3D数据中学习几何先验。

Result: 在静态和动态场景基准测试中表现优异，且兼容LLM式训练基础设施。

Conclusion: STream3R展示了因果Transformer模型在实时3D感知中的潜力。

Abstract: We present STream3R, a novel approach to 3D reconstruction that reformulates
pointmap prediction as a decoder-only Transformer problem. Existing
state-of-the-art methods for multi-view reconstruction either depend on
expensive global optimization or rely on simplistic memory mechanisms that
scale poorly with sequence length. In contrast, STream3R introduces an
streaming framework that processes image sequences efficiently using causal
attention, inspired by advances in modern language modeling. By learning
geometric priors from large-scale 3D datasets, STream3R generalizes well to
diverse and challenging scenarios, including dynamic scenes where traditional
methods often fail. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently
outperforms prior work across both static and dynamic scene benchmarks.
Moreover, STream3R is inherently compatible with LLM-style training
infrastructure, enabling efficient large-scale pretraining and fine-tuning for
various downstream 3D tasks. Our results underscore the potential of causal
Transformer models for online 3D perception, paving the way for real-time 3D
understanding in streaming environments. More details can be found in our

Motivation: 自监督学习在遥感领域潜力巨大，但现有方法需适应地球观测数据的独特特性。

Method: 通过全面评估融合策略和重建目标归一化方案，提出MAESTRO方法，结合优化的融合策略和光谱先验的自监督信号。

Result: 在四个数据集上，MAESTRO在多时相任务中表现最佳，同时在单时相任务中保持竞争力。

Conclusion: MAESTRO为遥感数据的自监督学习提供了高效解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning holds great promise for remote sensing, but standard
self-supervised methods must be adapted to the unique characteristics of Earth
observation data. We take a step in this direction by conducting a
comprehensive benchmark of fusion strategies and reconstruction target
normalization schemes for multimodal, multitemporal, and multispectral Earth
observation data. Based on our findings, we propose MAESTRO, a novel adaptation
of the Masked Autoencoder, featuring optimized fusion strategies and a tailored
target normalization scheme that introduces a spectral prior as a
self-supervisory signal. Evaluated on four Earth observation datasets, MAESTRO
sets a new state-of-the-art on tasks that strongly rely on multitemporal
dynamics, while remaining highly competitive on tasks dominated by a single
mono-temporal modality. Code to reproduce all our experiments is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出ESSENTIAL方法，通过结合稀疏特征存储的episodic memory和通用知识存储的semantic memory，解决视频类增量学习中的内存与性能权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频类增量学习方法在内存效率和性能之间存在矛盾，稀疏存储牺牲了时间信息，而密集存储内存效率低。

Method: ESSENTIAL结合episodic memory（稀疏特征）和semantic memory（可学习提示），通过跨注意力机制检索密集特征。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，ESSENTIAL在显著减少内存的同时保持了优越性能。

Conclusion: ESSENTIAL有效解决了视频类增量学习中的内存与性能权衡问题。

Abstract: In this work, we tackle the problem of video classincremental learning
(VCIL). Many existing VCIL methods mitigate catastrophic forgetting by
rehearsal training with a few temporally dense samples stored in episodic
memory, which is memory-inefficient. Alternatively, some methods store
temporally sparse samples, sacrificing essential temporal information and
thereby resulting in inferior performance. To address this trade-off between
memory-efficiency and performance, we propose EpiSodic and SEmaNTIc memory
integrAtion for video class-incremental Learning (ESSENTIAL). ESSENTIAL
consists of episodic memory for storing temporally sparse features and semantic
memory for storing general knowledge represented by learnable prompts. We
introduce a novel memory retrieval (MR) module that integrates episodic memory
and semantic prompts through cross-attention, enabling the retrieval of
temporally dense features from temporally sparse features. We rigorously
validate ESSENTIAL on diverse datasets: UCF-101, HMDB51, and
Something-Something-V2 from the TCD benchmark and UCF-101, ActivityNet, and
Kinetics-400 from the vCLIMB benchmark. Remarkably, with significantly reduced
memory, ESSENTIAL achieves favorable performance on the benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有跨领域模型依赖领域特定组件和多阶段训练，限制了实用性和扩展性。本文旨在通过单阶段训练和通用框架解决这些问题。

Method: 首先提出Pose-in-Context (PiC)，利用上下文学习实现跨领域模型；进一步扩展为Human-in-Context (HiC)，结合姿态和网格表示，引入最大最小相似性提示采样策略和双分支上下文注入架构。

Result: 实验表明，HiC在泛化能力、数据规模和性能上优于PiC，展现了统一跨领域3D人体运动模型的潜力。

Conclusion: HiC通过单阶段训练和通用框架，显著提升了跨领域3D人体运动模型的灵活性和扩展性。

Abstract: This paper aims to model 3D human motion across domains, where a single model
is expected to handle multiple modalities, tasks, and datasets. Existing
cross-domain models often rely on domain-specific components and multi-stage
training, which limits their practicality and scalability. To overcome these
challenges, we propose a new setting to train a unified cross-domain model
through a single process, eliminating the need for domain-specific components
and multi-stage training. We first introduce Pose-in-Context (PiC), which
leverages in-context learning to create a pose-centric cross-domain model.
While PiC generalizes across multiple pose-based tasks and datasets, it
encounters difficulties with modality diversity, prompting strategy, and
contextual dependency handling. We thus propose Human-in-Context (HiC), an
extension of PiC that broadens generalization across modalities, tasks, and
datasets. HiC combines pose and mesh representations within a unified
framework, expands task coverage, and incorporates larger-scale datasets.
Additionally, HiC introduces a max-min similarity prompt sampling strategy to
enhance generalization across diverse domains and a network architecture with
dual-branch context injection for improved handling of contextual dependencies.
Extensive experimental results show that HiC performs better than PiC in terms
of generalization, data scale, and performance across a wide range of domains.
These results demonstrate the potential of HiC for building a unified
cross-domain 3D human motion model with improved flexibility and scalability.

<details>

Motivation: 量子隐式神经表示（QINRs）在架构、设计、训练效率等方面存在挑战，本文旨在通过QVF解决这些问题。

Method: QVF使用基于可学习能量流形的神经振幅编码，设计全纠缠参数化量子电路，直接在实希尔伯特空间操作，实现稳定训练。

Result: QVF在视觉表示准确性上优于现有量子方法和经典基线，并在2D和3D场补全及形状插值中展示实用潜力。

Conclusion: QVF为量子隐式神经表示提供了一种高效且稳定的新方法，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: Quantum Implicit Neural Representations (QINRs) include components for
learning and execution on gate-based quantum computers. While QINRs recently
emerged as a promising new paradigm, many challenges concerning their
architecture and ansatz design, the utility of quantum-mechanical properties,
training efficiency and the interplay with classical modules remain. This paper
advances the field by introducing a new type of QINR for 2D image and 3D
geometric field learning, which we collectively refer to as Quantum Visual
Field (QVF). QVF encodes classical data into quantum statevectors using neural
amplitude encoding grounded in a learnable energy manifold, ensuring meaningful
Hilbert space embeddings. Our ansatz follows a fully entangled design of
learnable parametrised quantum circuits, with quantum (unitary) operations
performed in the real Hilbert space, resulting in numerically stable training
with fast convergence. QVF does not rely on classical post-processing -- in
contrast to the previous QINR learning approach -- and directly employs
projective measurement to extract learned signals encoded in the ansatz.
Experiments on a quantum hardware simulator demonstrate that QVF outperforms
the existing quantum approach and widely used classical foundational baselines
in terms of visual representation accuracy across various metrics and model
characteristics, such as learning of high-frequency details. We also show
applications of QVF in 2D and 3D field completion and 3D shape interpolation,
highlighting its practical potential.

Conclusion: 结合可解释性的CNN方法可为肺癌筛查提供快速、准确且透明的支持，尤其适用于资源有限的环境。

Abstract: Early detection of lung cancer is critical to improving survival outcomes. We
present a deep learning framework for automated lung cancer screening from
chest computed tomography (CT) images with integrated explainability. Using the
IQ-OTH/NCCD dataset (1,197 scans across Normal, Benign, and Malignant classes),
we evaluate a custom convolutional neural network (CNN) and three fine-tuned
transfer learning backbones: DenseNet121, ResNet152, and VGG19. Models are
trained with cost-sensitive learning to mitigate class imbalance and evaluated
via accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. While ResNet152
achieved the highest accuracy (97.3%), DenseNet121 provided the best overall
balance in precision, recall, and F1 (up to 92%, 90%, 91%, respectively). We
further apply Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to visualize evidence
contributing to predictions, improving clinical transparency. Results indicate
that CNN-based approaches augmented with explainability can provide fast,
accurate, and interpretable support for lung cancer screening, particularly in
resource-limited settings.

Conclusion: 研究为手术视频分析提供了鲁棒、高效且可扩展的解决方案，为通用AI系统在手术护理和培训中的应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Advances in surgical video analysis are transforming operating rooms into
intelligent, data-driven environments. Computer-assisted systems support full
surgical workflow, from preoperative planning to intraoperative guidance and
postoperative assessment. However, developing robust and generalizable models
for surgical video understanding remains challenging due to (I) annotation
scarcity, (II) spatiotemporal complexity, and (III) domain gap across
procedures and institutions. This doctoral research aims to bridge the gap
between deep learning-based surgical video analysis in research and its
real-world clinical deployment. To address the core challenge of recognizing
surgical phases, actions, and events, critical for analysis, I benchmarked
state-of-the-art neural network architectures to identify the most effective
designs for each task. I further improved performance by proposing novel
architectures and integrating advanced modules. Given the high cost of expert
annotations and the domain gap across surgical video sources, I focused on
reducing reliance on labeled data. We developed semi-supervised frameworks that
improve model performance across tasks by leveraging large amounts of unlabeled
surgical video. We introduced novel semi-supervised frameworks, including DIST,
SemiVT-Surge, and ENCORE, that achieved state-of-the-art results on challenging
surgical datasets by leveraging minimal labeled data and enhancing model
training through dynamic pseudo-labeling. To support reproducibility and
advance the field, we released two multi-task datasets: GynSurg, the largest
gynecologic laparoscopy dataset, and Cataract-1K, the largest cataract surgery
video dataset. Together, this work contributes to robust, data-efficient, and
clinically scalable solutions for surgical video analysis, laying the
foundation for generalizable AI systems that can meaningfully impact surgical
care and training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在图像配准中面临大偏差和缺乏可解释性的问题，需要一种更高效、鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 结合DINOv2的强大特征表示和LoRA层减少可训练参数，通过自动检测标志点实现图像配准。

Result: 在肾脏、肝脏和肺部的实验中，Dice分数分别为92.07%、90.90%和95.23%，处理时间约30ms。

Conclusion: DINOMotion在实时运动跟踪中表现出色，特别是在处理大偏差时，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Accurate tissue motion tracking is critical to ensure treatment outcome and
safety in 2D-Cine MRI-guided radiotherapy. This is typically achieved by
registration of sequential images, but existing methods often face challenges
with large misalignments and lack of interpretability. In this paper, we
introduce DINOMotion, a novel deep learning framework based on DINOv2 with
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) layers for robust, efficient, and interpretable
motion tracking. DINOMotion automatically detects corresponding landmarks to
derive optimal image registration, enhancing interpretability by providing
explicit visual correspondences between sequential images. The integration of
LoRA layers reduces trainable parameters, improving training efficiency, while
DINOv2's powerful feature representations offer robustness against large
misalignments. Unlike iterative optimization-based methods, DINOMotion directly
computes image registration at test time. Our experiments on volunteer and
patient datasets demonstrate its effectiveness in estimating both linear and
nonlinear transformations, achieving Dice scores of 92.07% for the kidney,
90.90% for the liver, and 95.23% for the lung, with corresponding Hausdorff
distances of 5.47 mm, 8.31 mm, and 6.72 mm, respectively. DINOMotion processes
each scan in approximately 30ms and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, particularly in handling large misalignments. These results highlight
its potential as a robust and interpretable solution for real-time motion
tracking in 2D-Cine MRI-guided radiotherapy.

Conclusion: Haar-tSVD在速度和性能间取得平衡，并通过自适应噪声估计提升鲁棒性。

Abstract: The advancement of imaging devices and countless image data generated
everyday impose an increasingly high demand on efficient and effective image
denoising. In this paper, we present a computationally simple denoising
algorithm, termed Haar-tSVD, aiming to explore the nonlocal self-similarity
prior and leverage the connection between principal component analysis (PCA)
and the Haar transform under circulant representation. We show that global and
local patch correlations can be effectively captured through a unified
tensor-singular value decomposition (t-SVD) projection with the Haar transform.
This results in a one-step, highly parallelizable filtering method that
eliminates the need for learning local bases to represent image patches,
striking a balance between denoising speed and performance. Furthermore, we
introduce an adaptive noise estimation scheme based on a CNN estimator and
eigenvalue analysis to enhance the robustness and adaptability of the proposed
method. Experiments on different real-world denoising tasks validate the
efficiency and effectiveness of Haar-tSVD for noise removal and detail
preservation. Datasets, code and results are publicly available at

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CvG-Diff的交叉视图广义扩散模型，用于稀疏视图CT重建，通过确定性退化操作和两项创新技术（EPCT和SPDPS），在仅10步迭代内实现高质量重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏视图CT重建因投影视图采样不足导致严重伪影，现有深度学习方法易产生过度平滑结果，扩散模型则存在计算效率低和稳定性问题。

Method: CvG-Diff将稀疏视图CT重建建模为广义扩散过程，引入EPCT抑制伪影传播，SPDPS优先保证语义正确性。

Result: 在AAPM-LDCT数据集上，仅用10步迭代即达到38.34 dB PSNR和0.9518 SSIM，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CvG-Diff通过创新技术显著提升了稀疏视图CT重建的质量和效率。

Abstract: Sparse-view computed tomography (CT) reduces radiation exposure by
subsampling projection views, but conventional reconstruction methods produce
severe streak artifacts with undersampled data. While deep-learning-based
methods enable single-step artifact suppression, they often produce
over-smoothed results under significant sparsity. Though diffusion models
improve reconstruction via iterative refinement and generative priors, they
require hundreds of sampling steps and struggle with stability in highly sparse
regimes. To tackle these concerns, we present the Cross-view Generalized
Diffusion Model (CvG-Diff), which reformulates sparse-view CT reconstruction as
a generalized diffusion process. Unlike existing diffusion approaches that rely
on stochastic Gaussian degradation, CvG-Diff explicitly models image-domain
artifacts caused by angular subsampling as a deterministic degradation
operator, leveraging correlations across sparse-view CT at different sample
rates. To address the inherent artifact propagation and inefficiency of
sequential sampling in generalized diffusion model, we introduce two
innovations: Error-Propagating Composite Training (EPCT), which facilitates
identifying error-prone regions and suppresses propagated artifacts, and
Semantic-Prioritized Dual-Phase Sampling (SPDPS), an adaptive strategy that
prioritizes semantic correctness before detail refinement. Together, these
innovations enable CvG-Diff to achieve high-quality reconstructions with
minimal iterations, achieving 38.34 dB PSNR and 0.9518 SSIM for 18-view CT
using only \textbf{10} steps on AAPM-LDCT dataset. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority of CvG-Diff over state-of-the-art sparse-view CT
reconstruction methods. The code is available at

### [113] [DIVA-VQA: Detecting Inter-frame Variations in UGC Video Quality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10605)
*Xinyi Wang,Angeliki Katsenou,David Bull*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于时空碎片化的无参考视频质量评估（NR-VQA）模型，通过帧间差异分析多层次的敏感区域，结合2D和3D特征，性能优异且运行效率高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着用户生成视频内容的快速增长，无参考视频质量评估（NR-VQA）在社交媒体和流媒体应用中需求增加，但缺乏参考视频的挑战需要解决。

Method: 模型利用帧间差异，逐步分析帧、块和碎片帧的质量敏感区域，结合全局和局部信息，提取2D和3D特征。

Result: 在五个UGC数据集上测试，模型性能排名前二（DIVA-VQA-L: 0.898，DIVA-VQA-B: 0.886），运行效率高。

Conclusion: 提出的NR-VQA模型在性能和效率上均表现优异，适用于大规模视频质量监控。

Abstract: The rapid growth of user-generated (video) content (UGC) has driven increased
demand for research on no-reference (NR) perceptual video quality assessment
(VQA). NR-VQA is a key component for large-scale video quality monitoring in
social media and streaming applications where a pristine reference is not
available. This paper proposes a novel NR-VQA model based on spatio-temporal
fragmentation driven by inter-frame variations. By leveraging these inter-frame
differences, the model progressively analyses quality-sensitive regions at
multiple levels: frames, patches, and fragmented frames. It integrates frames,
fragmented residuals, and fragmented frames aligned with residuals to
effectively capture global and local information. The model extracts both 2D
and 3D features in order to characterize these spatio-temporal variations.
Experiments conducted on five UGC datasets and against state-of-the-art models
ranked our proposed method among the top 2 in terms of average rank correlation
(DIVA-VQA-L: 0.898 and DIVA-VQA-B: 0.886). The improved performance is offered
at a low runtime complexity, with DIVA-VQA-B ranked top and DIVA-VQA-L third on
average compared to the fastest existing NR-VQA method. Code and models are
publicly available at: https://github.com/xinyiW915/DIVA-VQA.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了多模态大语言模型（mLLMs）在3D边界表示（B-rep）CAD对象高级编辑中的应用，提出了B-repLer模型，通过多模态架构实现文本提示驱动的语义编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管mLLMs在图像和文本任务中表现优异，但在3D分析和编辑任务中表现有限，尤其是B-rep CAD对象缺乏标注数据和特定表示挑战。

Method: 提出B-repLer，一种针对B-rep模型优化的mLLM，结合新颖的多模态架构和自动生成的数据集方法。

Result: B-repLer能够基于文本提示对B-rep进行语义编辑，生成有效输出，解决了此前无法实现的复杂编辑任务。

Conclusion: B-repLer展示了mLLMs在3D CAD编辑中的潜力，为无外部标注的自动化编辑提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (mLLMs), trained in a mixed modal setting as
a universal model, have been shown to compete with or even outperform many
specialized algorithms for imaging and graphics tasks. As demonstrated across
many applications, mLLMs' ability to jointly process image and text data makes
them suitable for zero-shot applications or efficient fine-tuning towards
specialized tasks. However, they have had limited success in 3D analysis and
editing tasks. This is due to both the lack of suitable (annotated) 3D data as
well as the idiosyncrasies of 3D representations. In this paper, we investigate
whether mLLMs can be adapted to support high-level editing of Boundary
Representation (B-rep) CAD objects. B-reps remain the industry-standard for
precisely encoding engineering objects, but are challenging as the
representation is fragile (i.e. can easily lead to invalid CAD objects) and no
publicly available data source exists with semantically-annotated B-reps or CAD
construction history. We present B-repLer as a finetuned mLLM that can
understand text prompts and make semantic edits on given B-Reps to produce
valid outputs. We enable this via a novel multimodal architecture, specifically
designed to handle B-rep models, and demonstrate how existing CAD tools, in
conjunction with mLLMs, can be used to automatically generate the required
reasoning dataset, without relying on external annotations. We extensively
evaluate B-repLer and demonstrate several text-based B-rep edits of various
complexity, which were not previously possible.

*Mohammad Fereshtehpour,Rashid Bashir,Neil F. Tandon*

Main category: physics.geo-ph

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于风险的气候适应性道路排水设计风暴框架，结合气候模型和风险评估，以应对未来极端降雨。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气候变化加剧极端降水事件，传统静态设计方法无法适应未来气候变异性。

Method: 整合CMIP6气候模型预测与风险评估，量化未来极端降雨对排水性能的影响，调整设计风暴。

Result: 通过安大略省的案例验证了框架的可扩展性和适应性，表明需转向动态风险导向设计方法。

Conclusion: 需从静态设计转向动态风险导向方法，提升交通网络的长期韧性。

Abstract: Climate change is amplifying extreme precipitation events in many regions and
imposes substantial challenges for the resilience of road drainage
infrastructure. Conventional design storm methodologies, which rely on
historical trends of rainfall data under a stationarity assumption, may not
adequately account for future climate variability. This study introduces a
risk-based framework for determining climate-informed design storms tailored to
road drainage systems. The proposed framework integrates climate model
projections with risk assessment to quantify the potential impacts of future
extreme rainfall on drainage performance and adjust the future design storm,
with a focus on the province of Ontario, Canada. Projected precipitation
changes for mid- and late-century time horizons are quantified using
statistically downscaled CMIP6 General Circulation Models. The risk level is
defined as a function of hazard and vulnerability, where hazard combines both
physiographic and meteorological factors. Vulnerability is comprised of
socioeconomic, transportation, and environmental considerations. To
systematically integrate these components, a weighting scheme is developed
based on a sensitivity analysis of the criteria, which provides flexibility in
assigning relative importance to each factor. The estimated risk level is then
applied to adjust the projected design storm accordingly. The proposed workflow
is demonstrated through both province-wide and site-specific applications
across Ontario's road network to better highlight its scalability and
adaptability. The findings signify the necessity of shifting from static,
stationarity-based design methodologies to dynamic, risk-informed approaches
that enhance the long-term resilience of transportation networks.

Main category: physics.geo-ph

TL;DR: 对比分析了数据域和图像域的最小二乘逆时偏移（LSRTM）方法，发现数据域方法在多参数重建中表现更优，而图像域方法在单参数情况下有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏对数据域和图像域LSRTM方法的详细比较，尤其是在多参数重建中的表现。

Method: 使用SMIwiz开源软件框架，分别实现数据域和图像域的LSRTM方法，比较其在速度和阻抗扰动重建中的效果。

Result: 数据域方法在多参数重建中效果更好，图像域方法在多参数情况下表现不佳，但在单参数重建中有效。

Conclusion: 数据域LSRTM更适合多参数重建，而图像域LSRTM在单参数情况下更具实用性。

Abstract: Least-squares reverse time migration (LSRTM) is one of the classic seismic
imaging methods to reconstruct model perturbations within a known reference
medium. It can be computed in either data or image domain using different
methods by solving a linear inverse problem, whereas a careful comparison
analysis of them is lacking in the literature. In this article, we present a
comparative study for multiparameter LSRTM in data- and image- domain in the
framework of SMIwiz open software. Different from conventional LSRTM for
recovering only velocity perturbation with variable density, we focus on
simultaneous reconstruction of velocity and impedance perturbations after
logorithmic scaling, using the first-order velocity-pressure formulation of
acoustic wave equation. The first 3D data-domain LSRTM example has been
performed to validate our implementation, involving expensive repetition of
Born modelling and migration over a number of iterations. As a more
cost-effective alternative, the image-domain LSRTM is implemented using point
spread function (PSF) and nonstationary deblurring filter. Dramatic
disctinctions between data and image domain methods are discovered with 2D
Marmousi test: (1) The data-domain multiparameter inversion provides much
better reconstruction of reflectivity images than image-domain approaches,
thanks to the complete use of Hessian in Krylov space; (2) The poor
multiparameter image-domain inversion highlights the limitation of incomplete
Hessian sampling and strong parameter crosstalks, making it difficult to work
in practice; (3) In contrast, monoparameter image-domain inversion for seismic
impedance is found to work well.

Abstract: Geomorphometric modeling and mapping of ice-free Antarctic areas is promising
for obtaining new quantitative knowledge about the topography of these unique
landscapes and for the further use of morphometric information in Antarctic
research. Within the framework of a project of creating a physical geographical
thematic scientific reference geomorphometric atlas of ice-free terrains of
Antarctica, we performed geomorphometric modeling and mapping of key ice-free
areas of the S\^oya Coast (the east coast of the L\"utzow-Holm Bay, Queen Maud
Land, East Antarctica). These include the Flatvaer Islands, Langhovde Hills,
Breidv\r{a}gnipa, Skarvsnes Foreland, Skallen Hills, and Skallevikhalsen Hills.
As input data for geomorphometric modeling and mapping, we used five fragments
of the Reference Elevation Model of Antarctica. For the six ice-free areas and
adjacent glaciers, we derived models and maps of eleven most scientifically
important morphometric variables (i.e., slope, aspect, horizontal curvature,
vertical curvature, minimal curvature, maximal curvature, catchment area,
topographic wetness index, stream power index, total insolation, and wind
exposition index). The obtained models and maps describe the ice-free
topography of the S\^oya Coast in a rigorous, quantitative, and reproducible
manner. New morphometric data can be useful for further geological,
geomorphological, glaciological, ecological, and hydrological studies of this
region.

Motivation: 表面波频散曲线反演在资源勘探和地质研究中至关重要，但受限于初始模型敏感性和计算效率低的问题。深度学习为解决这些问题提供了新思路，但缺乏大规模多样化的基准数据集。

Method: 通过SWIDP管道生成OpenSWI数据集，包括OpenSWI-shallow（浅层地质结构）、OpenSWI-deep（深层地质结构）和OpenSWI-real（真实数据）。

Result: 在OpenSWI-shallow和-deep上训练的模型在OpenSWI-real上表现出色，验证了数据集的多样性和代表性。

Conclusion: OpenSWI数据集和工具包的发布将推动智能表面波反演的发展。

Abstract: Surface wave dispersion curve inversion plays a critical role in both shallow
resource exploration and deep geological studies, yet it remains hindered by
sensitivity to initial models and low computational efficiency. Recently,
data-driven deep learning methods, inspired by advances in computer vision,
have shown promising potential to address these challenges. However, the lack
of large-scale, diverse benchmark datasets remains a major obstacle to their
development and evaluation. To bridge this gap, we present OpenSWI, a
comprehensive benchmark dataset generated through the Surface Wave Inversion
Dataset Preparation (SWIDP) pipeline. OpenSWI includes two synthetic datasets
tailored to different research scales and scenarios, OpenSWI-shallow and
OpenSWI-deep, and an AI-ready real-world dataset for generalization evaluation,
OpenSWI-real. OpenSWI-shallow, derived from the 2-D OpenFWI geological model
dataset, contains over 22 million 1-D velocity profiles paired with
fundamental-mode phase and group velocity dispersion curves, spanning a wide
range of shallow geological structures (e.g., flat layers, faults, folds,
realistic stratigraphy). OpenSWI-deep, built from 14 global and regional 3-D
geological models, comprises 1.26 million high-fidelity 1-D velocity-dispersion
pairs for deep-Earth studies. OpenSWI-real, compiled from open-source projects,
contains two sets of observed dispersion curves with corresponding reference
models, serving as a benchmark for evaluating model generalization. To
demonstrate utility, we trained models on OpenSWI-shallow and -deep and
evaluated them on OpenSWI-real, demonstrating strong agreement between
predictions and references, which confirms the diversity and representativeness
of the dataset. To advance intelligent surface wave inversion, we release the
SWIDP toolbox, OpenSWI datasets, and trained models for the research community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着‘被遗忘权’需求的增加，机器遗忘成为提升信任和合规性的重要工具，但现有方法主要依赖模型权重调整，缺乏对数据层面调整的探索。

Method: 提出Water4MU框架，结合数字水印和双层优化（BLO），上层优化水印网络以减少遗忘难度，下层独立训练模型。

Result: 实验表明，Water4MU在图像分类和生成任务中均有效，尤其在‘挑战性遗忘’场景中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Water4MU通过数据水印实现了精确的机器遗忘，同时保持模型在无关任务中的实用性。

Abstract: With the increasing demand for the right to be forgotten, machine unlearning
(MU) has emerged as a vital tool for enhancing trust and regulatory compliance
by enabling the removal of sensitive data influences from machine learning (ML)
models. However, most MU algorithms primarily rely on in-training methods to
adjust model weights, with limited exploration of the benefits that data-level
adjustments could bring to the unlearning process. To address this gap, we
propose a novel approach that leverages digital watermarking to facilitate MU
by strategically modifying data content. By integrating watermarking, we
establish a controlled unlearning mechanism that enables precise removal of
specified data while maintaining model utility for unrelated tasks. We first
examine the impact of watermarked data on MU, finding that MU effectively
generalizes to watermarked data. Building on this, we introduce an
unlearning-friendly watermarking framework, termed Water4MU, to enhance
unlearning effectiveness. The core of Water4MU is a bi-level optimization (BLO)
framework: at the upper level, the watermarking network is optimized to
minimize unlearning difficulty, while at the lower level, the model itself is
trained independently of watermarking. Experimental results demonstrate that
Water4MU is effective in MU across both image classification and image
generation tasks. Notably, it outperforms existing methods in challenging MU
scenarios, known as "challenging forgets".

Abstract: The Algonauts 2025 Challenge just wrapped up a few weeks ago. It is a
biennial challenge in computational neuroscience in which teams attempt to
build models that predict human brain activity from carefully curated stimuli.
Previous editions (2019, 2021, 2023) focused on still images and short videos;
the 2025 edition, which concluded last month (late July), pushed the field
further by using long, multimodal movies. Teams were tasked with predicting
fMRI responses across 1,000 whole-brain parcels across four participants in the
dataset who were scanned while watching nearly 80 hours of naturalistic movie
stimuli. These recordings came from the CNeuroMod project and included 65 hours
of training data, about 55 hours of Friends (seasons 1-6) plus four feature
films (The Bourne Supremacy, Hidden Figures, Life, and The Wolf of Wall
Street). The remaining data were used for validation: Season 7 of Friends for
in-distribution tests, and the final winners for the Challenge were those who
could best predict brain activity for six films in their held-out
out-of-distribution (OOD) set. The winners were just announced and the top team
reports are now publicly available. As members of the MedARC team which placed
4th in the competition, we reflect on the approaches that worked, what they
reveal about the current state of brain encoding, and what might come next.

Result: 在视觉到fMRI编码性能上超越现有方法，适应新主体且提升数据有限的解码性能。

Conclusion: SynBrain揭示了跨试验和主体的功能一致性，并生成高质量fMRI信号。

Abstract: Deciphering how visual stimuli are transformed into cortical responses is a
fundamental challenge in computational neuroscience. This visual-to-neural
mapping is inherently a one-to-many relationship, as identical visual inputs
reliably evoke variable hemodynamic responses across trials, contexts, and
subjects. However, existing deterministic methods struggle to simultaneously
model this biological variability while capturing the underlying functional
consistency that encodes stimulus information. To address these limitations, we
propose SynBrain, a generative framework that simulates the transformation from
visual semantics to neural responses in a probabilistic and biologically
interpretable manner. SynBrain introduces two key components: (i) BrainVAE
models neural representations as continuous probability distributions via
probabilistic learning while maintaining functional consistency through visual
semantic constraints; (ii) A Semantic-to-Neural Mapper acts as a semantic
transmission pathway, projecting visual semantics into the neural response
manifold to facilitate high-fidelity fMRI synthesis. Experimental results
demonstrate that SynBrain surpasses state-of-the-art methods in
subject-specific visual-to-fMRI encoding performance. Furthermore, SynBrain
adapts efficiently to new subjects with few-shot data and synthesizes
high-quality fMRI signals that are effective in improving data-limited
fMRI-to-image decoding performance. Beyond that, SynBrain reveals functional
consistency across trials and subjects, with synthesized signals capturing
interpretable patterns shaped by biological neural variability. The code will
be made publicly available.

Conclusion: CAD-RL为自动化CAD建模提供了高效解决方案，并发布了ExeCAD数据集支持训练与基准测试。

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a vital role in engineering and
manufacturing, yet current CAD workflows require extensive domain expertise and
manual modeling effort. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have
made it possible to generate code from natural language, opening new
opportunities for automating parametric 3D modeling. However, directly
translating human design intent into executable CAD code remains highly
challenging, due to the need for logical reasoning, syntactic correctness, and
numerical precision. In this work, we propose CAD-RL, a multimodal
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) guided reinforcement learning post training framework
for CAD modeling code generation. Our method combines CoT-based Cold Start with
goal-driven reinforcement learning post training using three task-specific
rewards: executability reward, geometric accuracy reward, and external
evaluation reward. To ensure stable policy learning under sparse and
high-variance reward conditions, we introduce three targeted optimization
strategies: Trust Region Stretch for improved exploration, Precision Token Loss
for enhanced dimensions parameter accuracy, and Overlong Filtering to reduce
noisy supervision. To support training and benchmarking, we release ExeCAD, a
noval dataset comprising 16,540 real-world CAD examples with paired natural
language and structured design language descriptions, executable CADQuery
scripts, and rendered 3D models. Experiments demonstrate that CAD-RL achieves
significant improvements in reasoning quality, output precision, and code
executability over existing VLMs.

Abstract: The transnational ivory trade continues to drive the decline of elephant
populations across Africa, and trafficking networks remain difficult to
disrupt. Tusks seized by law enforcement officials carry forensic information
on the traffickers responsible for their export, including DNA evidence and
handwritten markings made by traffickers. For 20 years, analyses of tusk DNA
have identified where elephants were poached and established connections among
shipments of ivory. While the links established using genetic evidence are
extremely conclusive, genetic data is expensive and sometimes impossible to
obtain. But though handwritten markings are easy to photograph, they are rarely
documented or analyzed. Here, we present an AI-driven pipeline for extracting
and analyzing handwritten markings on seized elephant tusks, offering a novel,
scalable, and low-cost source of forensic evidence. Having collected 6,085
photographs from eight large seizures of ivory over a 6-year period
(2014-2019), we used an object detection model to extract over 17,000
individual markings, which were then labeled and described using
state-of-the-art AI tools. We identified 184 recurring "signature markings"
that connect the tusks on which they appear. 20 signature markings were
observed in multiple seizures, establishing forensic links between these
seizures through traffickers involved in both shipments. This work complements
other investigative techniques by filling in gaps where other data sources are
unavailable. The study demonstrates the transformative potential of AI in
wildlife forensics and highlights practical steps for integrating handwriting
analysis into efforts to disrupt organized wildlife crime.

Abstract: In healthcare, federated learning (FL) is a widely adopted framework that
enables privacy-preserving collaboration among medical institutions. With large
foundation models (FMs) demonstrating impressive capabilities, using FMs in FL
through cost-efficient adapter tuning has become a popular approach. Given the
rapidly evolving healthcare environment, it is crucial for individual clients
to quickly adapt to new tasks or diseases by tuning adapters while drawing upon
past experiences. In this work, we introduce Federated Knowledge-Enhanced
Initialization (FedKEI), a novel framework that leverages cross-client and
cross-task transfer from past knowledge to generate informed initializations
for learning new tasks with adapters. FedKEI begins with a global clustering
process at the server to generalize knowledge across tasks, followed by the
optimization of aggregation weights across clusters (inter-cluster weights) and
within each cluster (intra-cluster weights) to personalize knowledge transfer
for each new task. To facilitate more effective learning of the inter- and
intra-cluster weights, we adopt a bi-level optimization scheme that
collaboratively learns the global intra-cluster weights across clients and
optimizes the local inter-cluster weights toward each client's task objective.
Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets of different modalities,
including dermatology, chest X-rays, and retinal OCT, demonstrate FedKEI's
advantage in adapting to new diseases compared to state-of-the-art methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ReLU网络的梯度解释存在噪声且难以解释，现有方法（如GradCAM）通过生成代理模型平滑解释，但牺牲了忠实性。

Method: 引入光谱框架，系统分析平滑性和忠实性，量化ReLU网络对高频信息的贡献，并通过正则化识别权衡。

Result: 分析了代理平滑如何扭曲解释，提出了“解释差距”的定义和测量方法，并在不同设计、数据集和消融实验中验证了理论发现。

Conclusion: 光谱框架为解释的平滑性和忠实性提供了理论基础，揭示了现有方法的局限性，并提出了改进方向。

Abstract: ReLU networks, while prevalent for visual data, have sharp transitions,
sometimes relying on individual pixels for predictions, making vanilla
gradient-based explanations noisy and difficult to interpret. Existing methods,
such as GradCAM, smooth these explanations by producing surrogate models at the
cost of faithfulness. We introduce a unifying spectral framework to
systematically analyze and quantify smoothness, faithfulness, and their
trade-off in explanations. Using this framework, we quantify and regularize the
contribution of ReLU networks to high-frequency information, providing a
principled approach to identifying this trade-off. Our analysis characterizes
how surrogate-based smoothing distorts explanations, leading to an
``explanation gap'' that we formally define and measure for different post-hoc
methods. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings across different design
choices, datasets, and ablations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高对深度网络预测结果的信心，解决现有解释方法的可靠性问题。

Result: 揭示了梯度导致的谱偏差，验证了改进方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过理论分析和实验验证，为解释方法提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding the behavior of deep networks is crucial to increase our
confidence in their results. Despite an extensive body of work for explaining
their predictions, researchers have faced reliability issues, which can be
attributed to insufficient formalism. In our research, we adopt novel
probabilistic and spectral perspectives to formally analyze explanation
methods. Our study reveals a pervasive spectral bias stemming from the use of
gradient, and sheds light on some common design choices that have been
discovered experimentally, in particular, the use of squared gradient and input
perturbation. We further characterize how the choice of perturbation
hyperparameters in explanation methods, such as SmoothGrad, can lead to
inconsistent explanations and introduce two remedies based on our proposed
formalism: (i) a mechanism to determine a standard perturbation scale, and (ii)
an aggregation method which we call SpectralLens. Finally, we substantiate our
theoretical results through quantitative evaluations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用生成式AI（GenAI）预测土地覆盖变化的新方法，通过将土地覆盖变化预测视为基于历史和辅助数据的数据合成问题，展示了其可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 土地覆盖变化对地球系统过程有重要影响，但现有模型在预测土地覆盖变化方面的能力滞后。

Method: 采用扩散模型进行十年尺度的不透水面预测，并与无变化基线进行比较。

Result: 实验表明，在分辨率≥0.7×0.7km²时，模型的MAE低于基线，验证了生成模型能捕捉历史数据中的时空模式。

Conclusion: 生成式AI在土地覆盖变化预测中具有潜力，未来研究将结合地球物理属性和驱动变量以支持多场景模拟。

Abstract: Land cover, both present and future, has a significant effect on several
important Earth system processes. For example, impervious surfaces heat up and
speed up surface water runoff and reduce groundwater infiltration, with
concomitant effects on regional hydrology and flood risk. While regional Earth
System models have increasing skill at forecasting hydrologic and atmospheric
processes at high resolution in future climate scenarios, our ability to
forecast land-use and land-cover change (LULC), a critical input to risk and
consequences assessment for these scenarios, has lagged behind. In this paper,
we propose a new paradigm exploiting Generative AI (GenAI) for land cover
change forecasting by framing LULC forecasting as a data synthesis problem
conditioned on historical and auxiliary data-sources. We discuss desirable
properties of generative models that fundament our research premise, and
demonstrate the feasibility of our methodology through experiments on
imperviousness forecasting using historical data covering the entire
conterminous United States. Specifically, we train a diffusion model for
decadal forecasting of imperviousness and compare its performance to a baseline
that assumes no change at all. Evaluation across 12 metropolitan areas for a
year held-out during training indicate that for average resolutions $\geq
0.7\times0.7km^2$ our model yields MAE lower than such a baseline. This finding
corroborates that such a generative model can capture spatiotemporal patterns
from historical data that are significant for projecting future change.
Finally, we discuss future research to incorporate auxiliary information on
physical properties about the Earth, as well as supporting simulation of
different scenarios by means of driver variables.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ReconVLA是一种通过重建目标区域视觉注意力来改进Vision-Language-Action（VLA）模型的方法，解决了当前模型视觉注意力分散的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLA模型在视觉注意力分配上表现不佳，注意力分散，无法准确聚焦目标区域。

Method: 提出ReconVLA，利用扩散变换器重建图像中的目标区域（注视区域），引导模型学习细粒度表示并准确分配视觉注意力。

Result: 实验表明，ReconVLA在模拟和真实环境中均表现出精确操作和泛化能力。

Conclusion: ReconVLA通过隐式接地范式有效提升了VLA模型的视觉注意力分配和任务执行能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have enabled robotic
agents to integrate multimodal understanding with action execution. However,
our empirical analysis reveals that current VLAs struggle to allocate visual
attention to target regions. Instead, visual attention is always dispersed. To
guide the visual attention grounding on the correct target, we propose
ReconVLA, a reconstructive VLA model with an implicit grounding paradigm.
Conditioned on the model's visual outputs, a diffusion transformer aims to
reconstruct the gaze region of the image, which corresponds to the target
manipulated objects. This process prompts the VLA model to learn fine-grained
representations and accurately allocate visual attention, thus effectively
leveraging task-specific visual information and conducting precise
manipulation. Moreover, we curate a large-scale pretraining dataset comprising
over 100k trajectories and 2 million data samples from open-source robotic
datasets, further boosting the model's generalization in visual reconstruction.
Extensive experiments in simulation and the real world demonstrate the
superiority of our implicit grounding method, showcasing its capabilities of
precise manipulation and generalization. Our project page is

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Self-correction Flywheel的新范式，通过利用模型的错误轨迹生成自校正数据，持续提升视觉语言导航模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言导航模型在执行指令时容易偏离正确轨迹，且缺乏有效的错误校正能力。

Method: 利用模型的错误轨迹作为数据源，开发了识别偏差和自动生成自校正数据的技术，通过多次迭代提升模型性能。

Result: 在R2R-CE和RxR-CE基准测试中，CorrectNav模型分别达到65.1%和69.3%的成功率，显著优于之前的最佳模型。

Conclusion: Self-correction Flywheel范式有效提升了模型的错误校正能力和动态障碍物避障能力，适用于复杂环境中的长指令跟随。

Abstract: Existing vision-and-language navigation models often deviate from the correct
trajectory when executing instructions. However, these models lack effective
error correction capability, hindering their recovery from errors. To address
this challenge, we propose Self-correction Flywheel, a novel post-training
paradigm. Instead of considering the model's error trajectories on the training
set as a drawback, our paradigm emphasizes their significance as a valuable
data source. We have developed a method to identify deviations in these error
trajectories and devised innovative techniques to automatically generate
self-correction data for perception and action. These self-correction data
serve as fuel to power the model's continued training. The brilliance of our
paradigm is revealed when we re-evaluate the model on the training set,
uncovering new error trajectories. At this time, the self-correction flywheel
begins to spin. Through multiple flywheel iterations, we progressively enhance
our monocular RGB-based VLA navigation model CorrectNav. Experiments on R2R-CE
and RxR-CE benchmarks show CorrectNav achieves new state-of-the-art success
rates of 65.1% and 69.3%, surpassing prior best VLA navigation models by 8.2%
and 16.4%. Real robot tests in various indoor and outdoor environments
demonstrate \method's superior capability of error correction, dynamic obstacle
avoidance, and long instruction following.

for publicly free access and retain approximately 90% for potential commercial
access with revenue sharing to contributors.

Conclusion: We-Math 2.0通过综合知识驱动设计和数据空间建模，显著提升了多模态大语言模型的数学推理能力。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities across various tasks, but still struggle with complex mathematical
reasoning. Existing research primarily focuses on dataset construction and
method optimization, often overlooking two critical aspects: comprehensive
knowledge-driven design and model-centric data space modeling. In this paper,
we introduce We-Math 2.0, a unified system that integrates a structured
mathematical knowledge system, model-centric data space modeling, and a
reinforcement learning (RL)-based training paradigm to comprehensively enhance
the mathematical reasoning abilities of MLLMs. The key contributions of We-Math
2.0 are fourfold: (1) MathBook Knowledge System: We construct a five-level
hierarchical system encompassing 491 knowledge points and 1,819 fundamental
principles. (2) MathBook-Standard & Pro: We develop MathBook-Standard, a
dataset that ensures broad conceptual coverage and flexibility through dual
expansion. Additionally, we define a three-dimensional difficulty space and
generate 7 progressive variants per problem to build MathBook-Pro, a
challenging dataset for robust training. (3) MathBook-RL: We propose a
two-stage RL framework comprising: (i) Cold-Start Fine-tuning, which aligns the
model with knowledge-oriented chain-of-thought reasoning; and (ii) Progressive
Alignment RL, leveraging average-reward learning and dynamic data scheduling to
achieve progressive alignment across difficulty levels. (4) MathBookEval: We
introduce a comprehensive benchmark covering all 491 knowledge points with
diverse reasoning step distributions. Experimental results show that
MathBook-RL performs competitively with existing baselines on four widely-used
benchmarks and achieves strong results on MathBookEval, suggesting promising
generalization in mathematical reasoning.

Motivation: 图形设计评估通常需要综合多个专家的反馈，但现有方法缺乏系统性。本文旨在通过多代理协作的方式，提供更全面的设计评估和可操作的反馈。

Method: 提出AgenticDRS系统，利用图匹配和提示扩展方法使代理具备设计感知能力，并通过元代理协调多个代理的协作分析。

Result: 实验表明，AgenticDRS在DRS-BENCH基准上优于现有方法，并通过消融实验验证了其关键组件的有效性。

Conclusion: AgenticDRS为图形设计评估提供了一种有效的多代理协作框架，有望推动这一实用但研究不足的方向的发展。

Abstract: Evaluating graphic designs involves assessing it from multiple facets like
alignment, composition, aesthetics and color choices. Evaluating designs in a
holistic way involves aggregating feedback from individual expert reviewers.
Towards this, we propose an Agentic Design Review System (AgenticDRS), where
multiple agents collaboratively analyze a design, orchestrated by a meta-agent.
A novel in-context exemplar selection approach based on graph matching and a
unique prompt expansion method plays central role towards making each agent
design aware. Towards evaluating this framework, we propose DRS-BENCH
benchmark. Thorough experimental evaluation against state-of-the-art baselines
adapted to the problem setup, backed-up with critical ablation experiments
brings out the efficacy of Agentic-DRS in evaluating graphic designs and
generating actionable feedback. We hope that this work will attract attention
to this pragmatic, yet under-explored research direction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种高效的多参数映射序列，以提升定量成像的准确性和效率。

Method: 基于3D-QALAS，结合3D FLASH和多回波梯度回波模块，采用螺旋式笛卡尔轨迹和零样本自监督学习算法进行重建。

Result: MIMOSA在仿真和实验中表现出优于3D-QALAS的参数估计准确性，支持高达11.8倍的加速因子，并在3T和7T下实现高分辨率成像。

Conclusion: MIMOSA展示了高效多参数映射的潜力，适用于快速、高分辨率的定量成像。

Abstract: Purpose: To develop a new sequence, MIMOSA, for highly-efficient T1, T2, T2*,
proton density (PD), and source separation quantitative susceptibility mapping
(QSM). Methods: MIMOSA was developed based on 3D-quantification using an
interleaved Look-Locker acquisition sequence with T2 preparation pulse
(3D-QALAS) by combining 3D turbo Fast Low Angle Shot (FLASH) and multi-echo
gradient echo acquisition modules with a spiral-like Cartesian trajectory to
facilitate highly-efficient acquisition. Simulations were performed to optimize
the sequence. Multi-contrast/-slice zero-shot self-supervised learning
algorithm was employed for reconstruction. The accuracy of quantitative mapping
was assessed by comparing MIMOSA with 3D-QALAS and reference techniques in both
ISMRM/NIST phantom and in-vivo experiments. MIMOSA's acceleration capability
was assessed at R = 3.3, 6.5, and 11.8 in in-vivo experiments, with
repeatability assessed through scan-rescan studies. Beyond the 3T experiments,
mesoscale quantitative mapping was performed at 750 um isotropic resolution at
7T. Results: Simulations demonstrated that MIMOSA achieved improved parameter
estimation accuracy compared to 3D-QALAS. Phantom experiments indicated that
MIMOSA exhibited better agreement with the reference techniques than 3D-QALAS.
In-vivo experiments demonstrated that an acceleration factor of up to R =
11.8-fold can be achieved while preserving parameter estimation accuracy, with
intra-class correlation coefficients of 0.998 (T1), 0.973 (T2), 0.947 (T2*),
0.992 (QSM), 0.987 (paramagnetic susceptibility), and 0.977 (diamagnetic
susceptibility) in scan-rescan studies. Whole-brain T1, T2, T2*, PD, source
separation QSM were obtained with 1 mm isotropic resolution in 3 min at 3T and
750 um isotropic resolution in 13 min at 7T. Conclusion: MIMOSA demonstrated
potential for highly-efficient multi-parametric mapping.
