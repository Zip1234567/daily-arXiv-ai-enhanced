### [1] [Text-Driven 3D Hand Motion Generation from Sign Language Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15902)
*Léore Bensabath,Mathis Petrovich,Gül Varol*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了HandMDM，一个基于文本描述的3D手部动作生成扩散模型，通过大规模手语视频数据集和LLM生成的文本标注进行训练，在跨语言和非手语动作生成方面表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D手部动作生成模型缺乏大规模文本标注数据，难以实现基于自然语言描述的精细动作控制。本文旨在通过自动化构建大规模文本-动作配对数据来解决这一问题。

Method: 利用大规模手语视频数据集，通过LLM将伪标注的手语类别转换为详细的运动描述文本，结合运动脚本提示构建训练数据，然后训练文本条件化的手部动作扩散模型HandMDM。

Result: HandMDM模型在多个领域表现出强大的泛化能力，包括同一手语中未见过的类别、不同手语的手势以及非手语手部动作，实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法成功构建了大规模文本-动作配对数据集，训练的HandMDM模型在跨领域手部动作生成方面具有优异性能，为相关研究提供了重要基础。

Abstract: Our goal is to train a generative model of 3D hand motions, conditioned on
natural language descriptions specifying motion characteristics such as
handshapes, locations, finger/hand/arm movements. To this end, we automatically
build pairs of 3D hand motions and their associated textual labels with
unprecedented scale. Specifically, we leverage a large-scale sign language
video dataset, along with noisy pseudo-annotated sign categories, which we
translate into hand motion descriptions via an LLM that utilizes a dictionary
of sign attributes, as well as our complementary motion-script cues. This data
enables training a text-conditioned hand motion diffusion model HandMDM, that
is robust across domains such as unseen sign categories from the same sign
language, but also signs from another sign language and non-sign hand
movements. We contribute extensive experimental investigation of these
scenarios and will make our trained models and data publicly available to
support future research in this relatively new field.

### [2] [VT-LVLM-AR: A Video-Temporal Large Vision-Language Model Adapter for Fine-Grained Action Recognition in Long-Term Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15903)
*Kaining Li,Shuwei He,Zihan Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VT-LVLM-AR是一个新颖的框架，通过视频到事件映射器和LVLM动作推理模块，在长视频动作识别中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长视频动作识别中复杂背景、细微动作差异、计算开销大、难以捕捉长程时间依赖性和语义理解有限等挑战。

Method: 使用Video-to-Event Mapper将原始视频转换为紧凑的视觉事件序列，然后通过冻结的LLaVA-1.5模型和Prompt Tuning进行动作分类。

Result: 在NTU RGB+D和NTU RGB+D 120数据集上达到最先进性能（NTU RGB+D X-Sub准确率94.1%），消融研究验证了各组件的重要性。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了通过有效的视频到语言转换和高效模型适配，利用LVLMs实现鲁棒且可解释的视频动作理解的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Human action recognition in long-term videos, characterized by complex
backgrounds and subtle action differences, poses significant challenges for
traditional deep learning models due to computational overhead, difficulty in
capturing long-range temporal dependencies, and limited semantic understanding.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
have shown remarkable capabilities in multi-modal understanding and reasoning,
their direct application to continuous video streams for fine-grained action
recognition remains an open problem. This paper introduces VT-LVLM-AR
(Video-Temporal Large Vision-Language Model Adapter for Action Recognition), a
novel framework designed to bridge this gap. VT-LVLM-AR comprises a
Video-to-Event Mapper (VTEM) that efficiently transforms raw video into
compact, semantically rich, and temporally coherent "visual event sequences"
through lightweight spatio-temporal feature extraction, adaptive temporal
pooling, and conceptual quantization with an event coherence bias. These visual
event sequences are then fed into an LVLM-based Action Reasoning module,
specifically a frozen LLaVA-1.5 model, adapted using parameter-efficient Prompt
Tuning (P-Tuning v2) for action classification. Comprehensive evaluations on
the NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120 datasets demonstrate that VT-LVLM-AR
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing methods
(e.g., 94.1% accuracy on NTU RGB+D X-Sub). Ablation studies confirm the
critical contributions of VTEM's components and the efficacy of Prompt Tuning,
while human evaluations underscore the interpretability of our visual event
representations. This work highlights the immense potential of leveraging LVLMs
for robust and interpretable video action understanding through effective
video-to-language translation and efficient model adaptation.

*Dexuan He,Xiao Zhou,Wenbin Guan,Liyuan Zhang,Xiaoman Zhang,Sinuo Xu,Ge Wang,Lifeng Wang,Xiaojun Yuan,Xin Sun,Yanfeng Wang,Kun Sun,Ya Zhang,Weidi Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PathPT是一个针对罕见癌症诊断的新框架，通过空间感知视觉聚合和任务特定提示调优，充分利用病理视觉语言基础模型的潜力，在少样本设置下显著提升亚型分类准确性和癌变区域定位能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 罕见癌症占所有恶性肿瘤的20-25%，特别是在儿科肿瘤中占比超过70%，但由于专家资源有限面临重大诊断挑战。现有的多实例学习方法仅依赖视觉特征，忽视了跨模态知识且缺乏可解释性。

Method: 提出PathPT框架，通过空间感知视觉聚合和任务特定提示调优，将WSI级监督转换为细粒度切片级指导，利用VL模型的零样本能力保持癌变区域定位，并通过与组织病理学语义对齐的提示实现跨模态推理。

Result: 在8个罕见癌症数据集（56种亚型，2910个WSI）和3个常见癌症数据集上测试，PathPT在四种最先进VL模型和四种MIL框架下，在三种少样本设置中均表现出优越性能，显著提升亚型分类准确性和癌变区域定位能力。

Conclusion: PathPT推进了AI辅助罕见癌症诊断，为在专业专家资源有限的环境中提高亚型分类准确性提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Rare cancers comprise 20-25% of all malignancies but face major diagnostic
challenges due to limited expert availability-especially in pediatric oncology,
where they represent over 70% of cases. While pathology vision-language (VL)
foundation models show promising zero-shot capabilities for common cancer
subtyping, their clinical performance for rare cancers remains limited.
Existing multi-instance learning (MIL) methods rely only on visual features,
overlooking cross-modal knowledge and compromising interpretability critical
for rare cancer diagnosis. To address this limitation, we propose PathPT, a
novel framework that fully exploits the potential of vision-language pathology
foundation models through spatially-aware visual aggregation and task-specific
prompt tuning. Unlike conventional MIL, PathPT converts WSI-level supervision
into fine-grained tile-level guidance by leveraging the zero-shot capabilities
of VL models, thereby preserving localization on cancerous regions and enabling
cross-modal reasoning through prompts aligned with histopathological semantics.
We benchmark PathPT on eight rare cancer datasets(four adult and four
pediatric) spanning 56 subtypes and 2,910 WSIs, as well as three common cancer
datasets, evaluating four state-of-the-art VL models and four MIL frameworks
under three few-shot settings. Results show that PathPT consistently delivers
superior performance, achieving substantial gains in subtyping accuracy and
cancerous region grounding ability. This work advances AI-assisted diagnosis
for rare cancers, offering a scalable solution for improving subtyping accuracy
in settings with limited access to specialized expertise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有船舶检测方法难以捕获细粒度语义信息，在复杂场景中效果有限，需要开发能够理解语义信息的先进检测框架。

Method: 结合视觉语言模型(VLMs)和多尺度自适应滑动窗口策略，使用专门设计的ShipSem-VL视觉语言数据集来捕获细粒度船舶属性。

Result: 通过三个明确定义的任务进行评估，提供了全面的性能分析，从多个角度证明了该框架在语义感知船舶检测方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了现有方法在复杂场景中语义信息捕获不足的问题，为语义感知船舶检测提供了有效的解决方案，在多个评估任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Ship detection in remote sensing imagery is a critical task with wide-ranging
applications, such as maritime activity monitoring, shipping logistics, and
environmental studies. However, existing methods often struggle to capture
fine-grained semantic information, limiting their effectiveness in complex
scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel detection framework
that combines Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with a multi-scale adaptive sliding
window strategy. To facilitate Semantic-Aware Ship Detection (SASD), we
introduce ShipSem-VL, a specialized Vision-Language dataset designed to capture
fine-grained ship attributes. We evaluate our framework through three
well-defined tasks, providing a comprehensive analysis of its performance and
demonstrating its effectiveness in advancing SASD from multiple perspectives.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发了一个无需深度学习的手部自由奶牛识别系统，包含自动目录构建、奶牛识别和视频流检测三个模块


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前文献中缺乏能够实现手部自由奶牛自动识别和分类的系统，特别是在奶牛场环境中对自由活动的奶牛进行无标签视频分析

Method: 系统由三个部分组成：AutoCattloger（使用单段输入视频为每头奶牛建立目录）、eidetic cow recognizer（不使用深度学习技术识别奶牛）、CowFinder（在连续视频流中识别奶牛）

Result: 系统成功在奶牛挤奶厅等候区的无约束行走视频中识别出个体奶牛，这些视频未经标记和分割

Conclusion: 该系统为奶牛场提供了一种有效的自动化奶牛识别解决方案，能够在真实环境中处理未标记的视频数据

Abstract: Few automated video systems are described in the open literature that enable
hands-free cataloging and identification (ID) of cows in a dairy herd. In this
work, we describe our system, composed of an AutoCattloger, which builds a
Cattlog of dairy cows in a herd with a single input video clip per cow, an
eidetic cow recognizer which uses no deep learning to ID cows, and a CowFinder,
which IDs cows in a continuous stream of video. We demonstrate its value in
finding individuals in unlabeled, unsegmented videos of cows walking
unconstrained through the holding area of a milking parlor.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 评估SINR模型作为地理先验在iNaturalist物种视觉分类中的效果，分析不同配置和处理未训练物种的方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物种分布模型编码了物种出现的空间模式，当有位置信息时可以作为视觉物种分类的有效先验

Method: 使用各种空间隐式神经表示(SINR)模型作为地理先验，评估不同模型配置和处理未训练物种预测的方法

Result: 分析揭示了影响这些模型作为地理先验有效性的因素，这些因素可能与制作准确分布图的考量不同

Conclusion: SINR模型可以作为有效的视觉物种分类地理先验，但需要针对分类任务优化配置和处理策略

Abstract: Species distribution models encode spatial patterns of species occurrence
making them effective priors for vision-based species classification when
location information is available. In this study, we evaluate various SINR
(Spatial Implicit Neural Representations) models as a geographical prior for
visual classification of species from iNaturalist observations. We explore the
impact of different model configurations and adjust how we handle predictions
for species not included in Geo Prior training. Our analysis reveals factors
that contribute to the effectiveness of these models as Geo Priors, factors
that may differ from making accurate range maps.

### [7] [Representation Learning with Adaptive Superpixel Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15959)
*Mahmoud Khalil,Ahmad Khalil,Alioune Ngom*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于Transformer的自监督模型ASC，通过自适应超像素层动态调整图像内容分割，克服传统ViT固定尺寸patch分区的限制，在标准图像下游任务基准上表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习视觉模型通常针对特定模态设计，依赖领域特定假设（如网格结构）。现有Vision Transformers依赖固定尺寸和非自适应的patch分区，存在局限性

Method: 提出自适应超像素编码(ASC)模型，采用自适应超像素层动态适应底层图像内容，基于Transformer架构的自监督学习方法

Result: 在标准图像下游任务基准测试中，该方法超越了广泛使用的替代方案

Conclusion: 自适应超像素编码方法有效克服了传统ViT的固定分区限制，通过内容自适应分割提升了模型性能

Abstract: Deep learning vision models are typically tailored for specific modalities
and often rely on domain-specific assumptions, such as the grid structures used
by nearly all existing vision models. In this work, we propose a
self-supervised model based on Transformers, which we call Adaptive Superpixel
Coding (ASC). The key insight of our model is to overcome the limitations of
traditional Vision Transformers, which depend on fixed-size and non-adaptive
patch partitioning. Instead, ASC employs adaptive superpixel layers that
dynamically adjust to the underlying image content. We analyze key properties
of the approach that make it effective, and find that our method outperforms
widely-used alternatives on standard image downstream task benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了Glo-VLMs框架，探索在数据受限情况下如何有效适应视觉语言模型进行细粒度肾小球分类，在每类仅8个样本的少样本学习中取得了良好性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在数字病理学中显示出潜力，但在区分肾小球亚型等细粒度疾病分类任务中效果有限。由于亚型间形态学差异细微且视觉模式与临床术语对齐困难，肾病理学自动诊断具有挑战性。

Method: 提出Glo-VLMs系统框架，利用精选病理图像和临床文本提示进行联合图像-文本表示学习，评估不同VLM架构和适应策略在少样本学习范式下的表现。

Result: 微调后的VLM在每类仅8个样本的情况下取得了0.7416准确率、0.9045宏AUC和0.5277 F1分数，表明即使监督信息极其有限，基础模型也能有效适应细粒度医学图像分类。

Conclusion: 研究表明大型预训练模型在专业临床研究应用中具有实际潜力，即使在高度受限的监督条件下也能有效适应细粒度医学图像分类任务。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown considerable potential in digital
pathology, yet their effectiveness remains limited for fine-grained,
disease-specific classification tasks such as distinguishing between glomerular
subtypes. The subtle morphological variations among these subtypes, combined
with the difficulty of aligning visual patterns with precise clinical
terminology, make automated diagnosis in renal pathology particularly
challenging. In this work, we explore how large pretrained VLMs can be
effectively adapted to perform fine-grained glomerular classification, even in
scenarios where only a small number of labeled examples are available. In this
work, we introduce Glo-VLMs, a systematic framework designed to explore the
adaptation of VLMs to fine-grained glomerular classification in
data-constrained settings. Our approach leverages curated pathology images
alongside clinical text prompts to facilitate joint image-text representation
learning for nuanced renal pathology subtypes. By assessing various VLMs
architectures and adaptation strategies under a few-shot learning paradigm, we
explore how both the choice of method and the amount of labeled data impact
model performance in clinically relevant scenarios. To ensure a fair
comparison, we evaluate all models using standardized multi-class metrics,
aiming to clarify the practical requirements and potential of large pretrained
models for specialized clinical research applications. As a result, fine-tuning
the VLMs achieved 0.7416 accuracy, 0.9045 macro-AUC, and 0.5277 F1-score with
only 8 shots per class, demonstrating that even with highly limited
supervision, foundation models can be effectively adapted for fine-grained
medical image classification.

*Minh-Tan Pham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文总结了作者在标签高效学习领域的系列贡献，主要关注计算机视觉和遥感领域中如何利用有限标注数据和大量未标注数据进行有效学习的方法开发与适配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现实应用中标注数据稀缺的问题，特别是在遥感领域面临的多模态、空间分辨率变化和场景异质性等独特挑战，需要开发能够有效利用有限标注和大量未标注数据的学习方法。

Method: 提出了四个主要方法：1)基于异常感知表示的弱监督学习；2)多任务学习联合训练多个数据集；3)多模态数据的自监督和监督对比学习；4)显式和隐式类别层次建模的少样本学习。

Result: 在自然和遥感数据集上进行了广泛实验，验证了所提方法的有效性，反映了多个合作研究项目的成果。

Conclusion: 论文最后概述了正在进行和未来的研究方向，重点关注为现实应用扩展和增强标签高效学习能力。

Abstract: This manuscript presents a series of my selected contributions to the topic
of label-efficient learning in computer vision and remote sensing. The central
focus of this research is to develop and adapt methods that can learn
effectively from limited or partially annotated data, and can leverage abundant
unlabeled data in real-world applications. The contributions span both
methodological developments and domain-specific adaptations, in particular
addressing challenges unique to Earth observation data such as multi-modality,
spatial resolution variability, and scene heterogeneity. The manuscript is
organized around four main axes including (1) weakly supervised learning for
object discovery and detection based on anomaly-aware representations learned
from large amounts of background images; (2) multi-task learning that jointly
trains on multiple datasets with disjoint annotations to improve performance on
object detection and semantic segmentation; (3) self-supervised and supervised
contrastive learning with multimodal data to enhance scene classification in
remote sensing; and (4) few-shot learning for hierarchical scene classification
using both explicit and implicit modeling of class hierarchies. These
contributions are supported by extensive experimental results across natural
and remote sensing datasets, reflecting the outcomes of several collaborative
research projects. The manuscript concludes by outlining ongoing and future
research directions focused on scaling and enhancing label-efficient learning
for real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用基于实例分割和全景分割的CNN方法，提高海滩垃圾检测的准确性和鲁棒性，解决传统CNN在复杂沙滩环境中因反射、阴影等干扰导致的误检问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN模型在沙滩垃圾检测中容易受到沙子颜色反射、人类脚印、阴影、藻类、沙丘等多种干扰因素的影响，导致大量误判，需要更先进的图像分割方法来提高检测准确性。

Method: 采用基于实例分割和全景分割的CNN方法，这些方法即使在样本数量较少的情况下也能表现出良好的准确性，提高了模型对复杂沙滩环境的适应性。

Result: 提出的分割方法相比基础CNN模型表现出更好的准确性和鲁棒性，能够有效减少沙滩环境中各种干扰因素导致的误检测。

Conclusion: 基于实例分割和全景分割的CNN方法更适合于复杂沙滩环境下的海洋垃圾监测任务，为解决全球海洋垃圾问题提供了更有效的技术手段。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been used efficiently in several
fields, including environmental challenges. In fact, CNN can help with the
monitoring of marine litter, which has become a worldwide problem. UAVs have
higher resolution and are more adaptable in local areas than satellite images,
making it easier to find and count trash. Since the sand is heterogeneous, a
basic CNN model encounters plenty of inferences caused by reflections of sand
color, human footsteps, shadows, algae present, dunes, holes, and tire tracks.
For these types of images, other CNN models, such as CNN-based segmentation
methods, may be more appropriate. In this paper, we use an instance-based
segmentation method and a panoptic segmentation method that show good accuracy
with just a few samples. The model is more robust and less

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视网膜疾病分类中大型专家标注临床数据集稀缺的问题，利用新发布的SynFundus-1M合成数据集来克服患者隐私和高成本障碍。

Method: 开发端到端深度学习流程，训练6种现代架构（ConvNeXtV2、SwinV2、ViT、ResNet、EfficientNetV2、RETFound基础模型），采用5折多标签分层交叉验证策略，并使用XGBoost分类器堆叠开发元集成模型。

Result: 集成模型在内部验证集上达到0.9973宏平均AUC，在三个真实临床数据集上分别达到：DR数据集0.7972 AUC、AIROGS青光眼数据集0.9126 AUC、RFMiD多标签数据集0.8800宏AUC。

Conclusion: 为大规模合成数据集研究提供了稳健基准，证明仅使用合成数据训练的模型能够准确分类多种病理并有效泛化到真实临床图像，为眼科综合AI系统开发提供了可行路径。

Abstract: The development of multi-label deep learning models for retinal disease
classification is often hindered by the scarcity of large, expertly annotated
clinical datasets due to patient privacy concerns and high costs. The recent
release of SynFundus-1M, a high-fidelity synthetic dataset with over one
million fundus images, presents a novel opportunity to overcome these barriers.
To establish a foundational performance benchmark for this new resource, we
developed an end-to-end deep learning pipeline, training six modern
architectures (ConvNeXtV2, SwinV2, ViT, ResNet, EfficientNetV2, and the
RETFound foundation model) to classify eleven retinal diseases using a 5-fold
multi-label stratified cross-validation strategy. We further developed a
meta-ensemble model by stacking the out-of-fold predictions with an XGBoost
classifier. Our final ensemble model achieved the highest performance on the
internal validation set, with a macro-average Area Under the Receiver Operating
Characteristic Curve (AUC) of 0.9973. Critically, the models demonstrated
strong generalization to three diverse, real-world clinical datasets, achieving
an AUC of 0.7972 on a combined DR dataset, an AUC of 0.9126 on the AIROGS
glaucoma dataset and a macro-AUC of 0.8800 on the multi-label RFMiD dataset.
This work provides a robust baseline for future research on large-scale
synthetic datasets and establishes that models trained exclusively on synthetic
data can accurately classify multiple pathologies and generalize effectively to
real clinical images, offering a viable pathway to accelerate the development
of comprehensive AI systems in ophthalmology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于潜在扩散模型的手语生成新方法，通过显式建模非手动特征（面部表情）和手动特征（手部动作），在保持语言内容的同时实现多样化的逼真数字化身生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手语生成模型难以在保持视觉质量的同时捕捉多样性，特别是非手动属性（如情感表情）的建模存在不足。

Method: 使用潜在扩散模型从生成参考图像合成逼真数字化身，提出新颖的手语特征聚合模块分别建模非手动特征（面部）和手动特征（手部）。

Result: 在YouTube-SL-25数据集上实验表明，该方法在视觉质量上优于现有最先进方法，感知指标有显著提升，能够无缝使用不同种族背景的参考图像确保多样性。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了手语生成中多样性保持与视觉质量平衡的问题，特别是在非手动特征建模方面表现出色，为手语生成提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The diversity of sign representation is essential for Sign Language
Production (SLP) as it captures variations in appearance, facial expressions,
and hand movements. However, existing SLP models are often unable to capture
diversity while preserving visual quality and modelling non-manual attributes
such as emotions. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach that
leverages Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to synthesise photorealistic digital
avatars from a generated reference image. We propose a novel sign feature
aggregation module that explicitly models the non-manual features
(\textit{e.g.}, the face) and the manual features (\textit{e.g.}, the hands).
We show that our proposed module ensures the preservation of linguistic content
while seamlessly using reference images with different ethnic backgrounds to
ensure diversity. Experiments on the YouTube-SL-25 sign language dataset show
that our pipeline achieves superior visual quality compared to state-of-the-art
methods, with significant improvements on perceptual metrics.

Abstract: Recent advancements in computer vision and deep learning have enhanced
disaster-response capabilities, particularly in the rapid assessment of
earthquake-affected urban environments. Timely identification of accessible
entry points and structural obstacles is essential for effective
search-and-rescue (SAR) operations. To address this need, we introduce
DRespNeT, a high-resolution dataset specifically developed for aerial instance
segmentation of post-earthquake structural environments. Unlike existing
datasets, which rely heavily on satellite imagery or coarse semantic labeling,
DRespNeT provides detailed polygon-level instance segmentation annotations
derived from high-definition (1080p) aerial footage captured in disaster zones,
including the 2023 Turkiye earthquake and other impacted regions. The dataset
comprises 28 operationally critical classes, including structurally compromised
buildings, access points such as doors, windows, and gaps, multiple debris
levels, rescue personnel, vehicles, and civilian visibility. A distinctive
feature of DRespNeT is its fine-grained annotation detail, enabling
differentiation between accessible and obstructed areas, thereby improving
operational planning and response efficiency. Performance evaluations using
YOLO-based instance segmentation models, specifically YOLOv8-seg, demonstrate
significant gains in real-time situational awareness and decision-making. Our
optimized YOLOv8-DRN model achieves 92.7% mAP50 with an inference speed of 27
FPS on an RTX-4090 GPU for multi-target detection, meeting real-time
operational requirements. The dataset and models support SAR teams and robotic
systems, providing a foundation for enhancing human-robot collaboration,
streamlining emergency response, and improving survivor outcomes.

Abstract: How can we extract complete geometric models of objects that we encounter in
our daily life, without having access to commercial 3D scanners? In this paper
we present an automated system for generating geometric models of objects from
two or more videos. Our system requires the specification of one known point in
at least one frame of each video, which can be automatically determined using a
fiducial marker such as a checkerboard or Augmented Reality (AR) marker. The
remaining frames are automatically positioned in world space by using
Structure-from-Motion techniques. By using multiple videos and merging results,
a complete object mesh can be generated, without having to rely on hole
filling. Code for our system is available from

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 汽车FMCW雷达在恶劣天气下可靠，但稀疏噪声点云限制了3D目标检测性能，需要多车协作提升感知能力

Method: 发布21k帧多车协作数据集，提出中晚期融合框架，使用多分支PointNet编码器融合空间、多普勒和强度信息

Result: 中融合配合强度编码使mAP提升高达9倍（IoU 0.9）， consistently优于单车基线

Conclusion: 建立了首个可复现的多车FMCW雷达感知基准，证明经济型雷达共享显著提升检测鲁棒性

Abstract: Automotive FMCW radars remain reliable in rain and glare, yet their sparse,
noisy point clouds constrain 3-D object detection. We therefore release
CoVeRaP, a 21 k-frame cooperative dataset that time-aligns radar, camera, and
GPS streams from multiple vehicles across diverse manoeuvres. Built on this
data, we propose a unified cooperative-perception framework with middle- and
late-fusion options. Its baseline network employs a multi-branch PointNet-style
encoder enhanced with self-attention to fuse spatial, Doppler, and intensity
cues into a common latent space, which a decoder converts into 3-D bounding
boxes and per-point depth confidence. Experiments show that middle fusion with
intensity encoding boosts mean Average Precision by up to 9x at IoU 0.9 and
consistently outperforms single-vehicle baselines. CoVeRaP thus establishes the
first reproducible benchmark for multi-vehicle FMCW-radar perception and
demonstrates that affordable radar sharing markedly improves detection
robustness. Dataset and code are publicly available to encourage further
research.

*Cory Gardner,Byungseok Min,Tae-Hyuk Ahn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WE-PaDiM通过小波变换增强PaDiM方法，用结构化的小波特征选择替代随机通道选择，在MVTec AD数据集上取得了优异的异常检测和定位性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PaDiM方法通过随机通道选择降低维度，可能丢失结构化信息。需要一种更原则性的特征选择方法来提升工业图像异常检测的性能。

Method: 将离散小波变换(DWT)与多层CNN特征结合，对特征图应用2D DWT，选择特定频率子带，空间对齐后通道级联，再用PaDiM的多变量高斯框架建模。

Result: 在MVTec AD数据集上，使用ResNet-18和EfficientNet B0-B6骨干网络，平均达到99.32%图像AUC和92.10%像素AUC的优异性能。

Conclusion: WE-PaDiM为PaDiM提供了竞争性强且可解释的特征选择替代方案，适合工业检测应用，具有相当的效率。

Abstract: Anomaly detection and localization in industrial images are essential for
automated quality inspection. PaDiM, a prominent method, models the
distribution of normal image features extracted by pre-trained Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) but reduces dimensionality through random channel
selection, potentially discarding structured information. We propose
Wavelet-Enhanced PaDiM (WE-PaDiM), which integrates Discrete Wavelet Transform
(DWT) analysis with multi-layer CNN features in a structured manner. WE-PaDiM
applies 2D DWT to feature maps from multiple backbone layers, selects specific
frequency subbands (e.g., LL, LH, HL), spatially aligns them, and concatenates
them channel-wise before modeling with PaDiM's multivariate Gaussian framework.
This DWT-before-concatenation strategy provides a principled method for feature
selection based on frequency content relevant to anomalies, leveraging
multi-scale wavelet information as an alternative to random selection. We
evaluate WE-PaDiM on the challenging MVTec AD dataset with multiple backbones
(ResNet-18 and EfficientNet B0-B6). The method achieves strong performance in
anomaly detection and localization, yielding average results of 99.32%
Image-AUC and 92.10% Pixel-AUC across 15 categories with per-class optimized
configurations. Our analysis shows that wavelet choices affect performance
trade-offs: simpler wavelets (e.g., Haar) with detail subbands (HL or LH/HL/HH)
often enhance localization, while approximation bands (LL) improve image-level
detection. WE-PaDiM thus offers a competitive and interpretable alternative to
random feature selection in PaDiM, achieving robust results suitable for
industrial inspection with comparable efficiency.

TL;DR: 提出Expandable Residual Approximation (ERA)方法，通过多分支残差网络分解残差知识，结合教师权重集成策略，显著提升知识蒸馏性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决教师模型与学生模型之间学习能力差距导致的知识传递不足问题

Method: 基于Stone-Weierstrass定理的渐进逼近原理，使用多分支残差网络(MBRNet)分解残差知识，引入教师权重集成(TWI)策略重用教师头部权重

Result: 在ImageNet分类基准上Top-1准确率提升1.41%，在MS COCO目标检测基准上AP提升1.40，在计算机视觉任务中达到领先性能

Conclusion: ERA方法通过分解残差知识和重用教师权重，有效缓解了师生模型能力差距问题，显著提升了知识蒸馏效果

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) aims to transfer knowledge from a large-scale
teacher model to a lightweight one, significantly reducing computational and
storage requirements. However, the inherent learning capacity gap between the
teacher and student often hinders the sufficient transfer of knowledge,
motivating numerous studies to address this challenge. Inspired by the
progressive approximation principle in the Stone-Weierstrass theorem, we
propose Expandable Residual Approximation (ERA), a novel KD method that
decomposes the approximation of residual knowledge into multiple steps,
reducing the difficulty of mimicking the teacher's representation through a
divide-and-conquer approach. Specifically, ERA employs a Multi-Branched
Residual Network (MBRNet) to implement this residual knowledge decomposition.
Additionally, a Teacher Weight Integration (TWI) strategy is introduced to
mitigate the capacity disparity by reusing the teacher's head weights.
Extensive experiments show that ERA improves the Top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet
classification benchmark by 1.41% and the AP on the MS COCO object detection
benchmark by 1.40, as well as achieving leading performance across computer
vision tasks. Codes and models are available at

Abstract: Reconstructing the 3D geometry, pose, and motion of animals is a
long-standing problem, which has a wide range of applications, from biology,
livestock management, and animal conservation and welfare to content creation
in digital entertainment and Virtual/Augmented Reality (VR/AR). Traditionally,
3D models of real animals are obtained using 3D scanners. These, however, are
intrusive, often prohibitively expensive, and difficult to deploy in the
natural environment of the animals. In recent years, we have seen a significant
surge in deep learning-based techniques that enable the 3D reconstruction, in a
non-intrusive manner, of the shape and motion of dynamic objects just from
their RGB image and/or video observations. Several papers have explored their
application and extension to various types of animals. This paper surveys the
latest developments in this emerging and growing field of research. It
categorizes and discusses the state-of-the-art methods based on their input
modalities, the way the 3D geometry and motion of animals are represented, the
type of reconstruction techniques they use, and the training mechanisms they
adopt. It also analyzes the performance of some key methods, discusses their
strengths and limitations, and identifies current challenges and directions for
future research.

Motivation: 现有的Transformer和SSM模型在点云检测中由于体素表示的串行处理限制，缺乏卷积操作提供的空间扩散能力，显著影响检测精度

Method: 设计VDM模块，包含稀疏3D卷积、子流形稀疏卷积和残差连接，将特征图下采样至原始分辨率的1/4，用于扩散前景体素特征和聚合细粒度空间信息

Result: VDM-SSMs在Waymo达到74.7 mAPH(L2)，nuScenes达到72.9 NDS，Argoverse 2达到42.3 mAP，ONCE达到67.6 mAP，在所有数据集上创下新SOTA

Conclusion: VDM能够无缝集成到主流Transformer或SSM检测模型中，显著提升检测精度，证明了方法的通用性和有效性

Abstract: Recent advances in point cloud object detection have increasingly adopted
Transformer-based and State Space Models (SSMs), demonstrating strong
performance. However, voxelbased representations in these models require strict
consistency in input and output dimensions due to their serialized processing,
which limits the spatial diffusion capability typically offered by
convolutional operations. This limitation significantly affects detection
accuracy. Inspired by CNN-based object detection architectures, we propose a
novel Voxel Diffusion Module (VDM) to enhance voxel-level representation and
diffusion in point cloud data. VDM is composed of sparse 3D convolutions,
submanifold sparse convolutions, and residual connections. To ensure
computational efficiency, the output feature maps are downsampled to one-fourth
of the original input resolution. VDM serves two primary functions: (1)
diffusing foreground voxel features through sparse 3D convolutions to enrich
spatial context, and (2) aggregating fine-grained spatial information to
strengthen voxelwise feature representation. The enhanced voxel features
produced by VDM can be seamlessly integrated into mainstream Transformer- or
SSM-based detection models for accurate object classification and localization,
highlighting the generalizability of our method. We evaluate VDM on several
benchmark datasets by embedding it into both Transformerbased and SSM-based
models. Experimental results show that our approach consistently improves
detection accuracy over baseline models. Specifically, VDM-SSMs achieve 74.7
mAPH (L2) on Waymo, 72.9 NDS on nuScenes, 42.3 mAP on Argoverse 2, and 67.6 mAP
on ONCE, setting new stateof-the-art performance across all datasets. Our code
will be made publicly available.

Motivation: 现有的病理学基础模型在不同数据集上使用不同策略训练，导致性能不一致和泛化能力有限，需要一种统一的集成解决方案。

Method: 采用集成学习方法整合五个最先进的病理学基础模型，生成统一的切片级表示，特别适用于数据有限的临床场景。

Conclusion: 集成学习对病理学基础模型具有强大效果，ELF可作为推进AI辅助精准肿瘤学的可扩展和通用化解决方案。

Abstract: Histopathology is essential for disease diagnosis and treatment
decision-making. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled
the development of pathology foundation models that learn rich visual
representations from large-scale whole-slide images (WSIs). However, existing
models are often trained on disparate datasets using varying strategies,
leading to inconsistent performance and limited generalizability. Here, we
introduce ELF (Ensemble Learning of Foundation models), a novel framework that
integrates five state-of-the-art pathology foundation models to generate
unified slide-level representations. Trained on 53,699 WSIs spanning 20
anatomical sites, ELF leverages ensemble learning to capture complementary
information from diverse models while maintaining high data efficiency. Unlike
traditional tile-level models, ELF's slide-level architecture is particularly
advantageous in clinical contexts where data are limited, such as therapeutic
response prediction. We evaluated ELF across a wide range of clinical
applications, including disease classification, biomarker detection, and
response prediction to major anticancer therapies, cytotoxic chemotherapy,
targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, across multiple cancer types. ELF
consistently outperformed all constituent foundation models and existing
slide-level models, demonstrating superior accuracy and robustness. Our results
highlight the power of ensemble learning for pathology foundation models and
suggest ELF as a scalable and generalizable solution for advancing AI-assisted
precision oncology.

Abstract: Although diffusion model has made good progress in the field of image
generation, GAN\cite{huang2023adaptive} still has a large development space due
to its unique advantages, such as WGAN\cite{liu2021comparing},
SSGAN\cite{guibas2021adaptive} \cite{zhang2022vsa} \cite{zhou2024adapt} and so

effectively improves the robustness and training stability of the model and
reduces the training cost. 3) : We propose a globally connected two-flow

improve the training efficiency and greatly improve the generalization ability,
with stronger flexibility. 4) : We propose a new dynamic embedded attention

Motivation: 解决无监督域自适应中分布偏移问题，旨在创建对输入扰动具有鲁棒性的域不变特征空间，而不需要目标域标签或复杂的训练目标。

Method: 结合三个关键组件：1）使用未标记目标数据适应批归一化统计；2）从源训练模型进行特征蒸馏；3）假设转移。通过在统计和表示层面对齐特征分布来实现。

Result: 在CIFAR10-C、CIFAR100-C、MNIST-C和PatchCamelyon-C等基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在抗腐蚀鲁棒性方面优于先前方法。理论和实证分析显示实现了改进的特征对齐、增加域间互信息和降低对输入扰动的敏感性。

Conclusion: DAFR2提供了一个简单而有效的解决方案，通过统计和表示层面的特征分布对齐，成功实现了跨相似域的鲁棒泛化，无需目标标签、复杂架构或复杂训练目标。

Abstract: We propose Domain Adaptation via Feature Refinement (DAFR2), a simple yet
effective framework for unsupervised domain adaptation under distribution
shift. The proposed method synergistically combines three key components:
adaptation of Batch Normalization statistics using unlabeled target data,
feature distillation from a source-trained model and hypothesis transfer. By
aligning feature distributions at the statistical and representational levels,
DAFR2 produces robust and domain-invariant feature spaces that generalize
across similar domains without requiring target labels, complex architectures
or sophisticated training objectives. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets, including CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, MNIST-C and PatchCamelyon-C,

Abstract: Conventional computed tomography (CT) lacks the ability to capture dynamic,
weight-bearing joint motion. Functional evaluation, particularly after surgical
intervention, requires four-dimensional (4D) imaging, but current methods are
limited by excessive radiation exposure or incomplete spatial information from
2D techniques. We propose an integrated 4D joint analysis platform that
combines: (1) a dual robotic arm cone-beam CT (CBCT) system with a
programmable, gantry-free trajectory optimized for upright scanning; (2) a
hybrid imaging pipeline that fuses static 3D CBCT with dynamic 2D X-rays using
deep learning-based preprocessing, 3D-2D projection, and iterative
optimization; and (3) a clinically validated framework for quantitative
kinematic assessment. In simulation studies, the method achieved sub-voxel
accuracy (0.235 mm) with a 99.18 percent success rate, outperforming
conventional and state-of-the-art registration approaches. Clinical evaluation
further demonstrated accurate quantification of tibial plateau motion and
medial-lateral variance in post-total knee arthroplasty (TKA) patients. This 4D

Abstract: Automatic detection of abnormal cervical cells from Thinprep Cytologic Test
(TCT) images is a critical component in the development of intelligent
computer-aided diagnostic systems. However, existing algorithms typically fail
to effectively model the correlations of visual features, while these spatial
correlation features actually contain critical diagnostic information.
Furthermore, no detection algorithm has the ability to integrate
inter-correlation features of cells with intra-discriminative features of
cells, lacking a fusion strategy for the end-to-end detection model. In this
work, we propose a hypergraph-based cell detection network that effectively
fuses different types of features, combining spatial correlation features and
deep discriminative features. Specifically, we use a Multi-level Fusion
Sub-network (MLF-SNet) to enhance feature extractioncapabilities. Then we
introduce a Cross-level Feature Fusion Strategy with Hypergraph Computation
module (CLFFS-HC), to integrate mixed features. Finally, we conducted
experiments on three publicly available datasets, and the results demonstrate
that our method significantly improves the performance of cervical abnormal
cell detection.

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently shown promise in
detecting anomalies. However, previous approaches are fundamentally limited by
their reliance on human-designed prompts and the lack of accessible anomaly
samples, leading to significant gaps in context-specific anomaly understanding.
In this paper, we propose \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{T}uning
with semantic alignment for anomaly detection (APT), a groundbreaking prior
knowledge-free, few-shot framework and overcomes the limitations of traditional
prompt-based approaches. APT uses self-generated anomaly samples with noise
perturbations to train learnable prompts that capture context-dependent
anomalies in different scenarios. To prevent overfitting to synthetic noise, we
propose a Self-Optimizing Meta-prompt Guiding Scheme (SMGS) that iteratively
aligns the prompts with general anomaly semantics while incorporating diverse
synthetic anomaly. Our system not only advances pixel-wise anomaly detection,
but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets
without requiring prior knowledge for prompt crafting, establishing a robust
and versatile solution for real-world anomaly detection.

Conclusion: RAGSR方法通过显式提取局部细粒度信息和有效编码，提供了对文本和图像信息集成的更精细控制，有效克服了传统SISR技术的限制

Abstract: The rich textual information of large vision-language models (VLMs) combined
with the powerful generative prior of pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion
models has achieved impressive performance in single-image super-resolution
(SISR). However, existing methods still face significant challenges in
generating clear and accurate regional details, particularly in scenarios
involving multiple objects. This challenge primarily stems from a lack of
fine-grained regional descriptions and the models' insufficient ability to
capture complex prompts. To address these limitations, we propose a Regional
Attention Guided Super-Resolution (RAGSR) method that explicitly extracts
localized fine-grained information and effectively encodes it through a novel
regional attention mechanism, enabling both enhanced detail and overall
visually coherent SR results. Specifically, RAGSR localizes object regions in
an image and assigns fine-grained caption to each region, which are formatted
as region-text pairs as textual priors for T2I models. A regional guided
attention is then leveraged to ensure that each region-text pair is properly
considered in the attention process while preventing unwanted interactions
between unrelated region-text pairs. By leveraging this attention mechanism,
our approach offers finer control over the integration of text and image
information, thereby effectively overcoming limitations faced by traditional
SISR techniques. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
our approach exhibits superior performance in generating perceptually authentic
visual details while maintaining contextual consistency compared to existing
approaches.

Abstract: Meta-learning aims to uniformly sample homogeneous support-query pairs,
characterized by the same categories and similar attributes, and extract useful
inductive biases through identical network architectures. However, this
identical network design results in over-semantic homogenization. To address
this, we propose a novel homologous but heterogeneous network. By treating
support-query pairs as dual perspectives, we introduce heterogeneous visual
aggregation (HA) modules to enhance complementarity while preserving semantic
commonality. To further reduce semantic noise and amplify the uniqueness of
heterogeneous semantics, we design a heterogeneous transfer (HT) module.
Finally, we propose heterogeneous CLIP (HC) textual information to enhance the
generalization capability of multimodal models. In the weakly-supervised
few-shot semantic segmentation (WFSS) task, with only 1/24 of the parameters of
existing state-of-the-art models, TLG achieves a 13.2\% improvement on
Pascal-5\textsuperscript{i} and a 9.7\% improvement on
COCO-20\textsuperscript{i}. To the best of our knowledge, TLG is also the first
weakly supervised (image-level) model that outperforms fully supervised
(pixel-level) models under the same backbone architectures. The code is

TL;DR: FTIO是一个后处理框架，通过频繁时间集成对象来解决无监督视频目标分割中的目标选择和时间不一致性问题，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无监督视频目标分割面临初始分割质量影响整个流程、小目标和复杂结构目标容易失败、形变和快速运动导致时间不一致性等挑战。

Method: 提出两个关键组件：1) 组合准则改进目标选择，提取频繁出现的显著目标；2) 三阶段方法通过集成缺失目标掩码区域来校正时间不一致性。

Result: 实验结果表明FTIO在多目标无监督视频目标分割任务中达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: FTIO框架有效解决了无监督视频目标分割中的目标选择和时间一致性问题，为实际应用提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Predicting and tracking objects in real-world scenarios is a critical
challenge in Video Object Segmentation (VOS) tasks. Unsupervised VOS (UVOS) has
the additional challenge of finding an initial segmentation of salient objects,
which affects the entire process and keeps a permanent uncertainty about the
object proposals. Moreover, deformation and fast motion can lead to temporal
inconsistencies. To address these problems, we propose Frequent Temporally
Integrated Objects (FTIO), a post-processing framework with two key components.
First, we introduce a combined criterion to improve object selection,
mitigating failures common in UVOS--particularly when objects are small or
structurally complex--by extracting frequently appearing salient objects.
Second, we present a three-stage method to correct temporal inconsistencies by
integrating missing object mask regions. Experimental results demonstrate that
FTIO achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-object UVOS. Code is

TL;DR: SpecVLM是一个针对视频大语言模型的无训练推测解码框架，通过两阶段视频token剪枝实现高达2.68倍的解码加速，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型依赖密集视频token表示，导致内存和计算开销巨大，特别是在预填充和解码阶段。现有token缩减方法存在信息丢失问题，需要无损加速解码过程。

Method: 提出基于推测解码的SpecVLM框架，包含两阶段视频token剪枝：第一阶段通过验证器注意力信号选择高信息量token，第二阶段以空间均匀方式剪枝冗余token。利用发现的新现象——草稿模型推测对视频token剪枝不敏感。

Result: 在四个视频理解基准测试中验证有效性，实现LLaVA-OneVision-72B模型2.68倍解码加速和Qwen2.5-VL-32B模型2.11倍加速，可剪枝高达90%视频token而不损失准确性。

Conclusion: SpecVLM通过创新的两阶段token剪枝和推测解码技术，成功解决了视频大语言模型的计算效率问题，为实际应用提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Video large language models (Vid-LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in
understanding video content. However, their reliance on dense video token
representations introduces substantial memory and computational overhead in
both prefilling and decoding. To mitigate the information loss of recent video
token reduction methods and accelerate the decoding stage of Vid-LLMs
losslessly, we introduce SpecVLM, a training-free speculative decoding (SD)
framework tailored for Vid-LLMs that incorporates staged video token pruning.
Building on our novel finding that the draft model's speculation exhibits low
sensitivity to video token pruning, SpecVLM prunes up to 90% of video tokens,
enabling efficient speculation without sacrificing accuracy. To achieve this,
it performs a two-stage pruning process: Stage I selects highly informative
tokens guided by attention signals from the verifier (target model), while
Stage II prunes remaining redundant ones in a spatially uniform manner.
Extensive experiments on four video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of SpecVLM, which achieves up to 2.68$\times$
decoding speedup for LLaVA-OneVision-72B and 2.11$\times$ speedup for
Qwen2.5-VL-32B.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出T-Mask方法，通过时间token掩码和动态区域强调，在单视角训练下提升基础模型在驾驶员监控中的跨视角泛化能力，无需额外参数即可显著提升准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 驾驶员监控中相机视角变化是常见挑战，现有基础模型在未见视角下的鲁棒性研究不足，需要探索轻量级适应方法来实现跨视角泛化。

Method: 提出T-Mask图像到视频探测方法，利用时间token掩码技术强调视频中更动态的区域，在DINOv2和CLIP基础模型上进行线性探测和参数高效微调对比。

Result: 在Drive&Act数据集上，T-Mask相比强基线提升跨视角top-1准确率1.23%，比PEFT方法提升8.0%，对次要活动识别提升显著（训练视角+5.42%，跨视角+1.36%）。

Conclusion: 轻量级探测方法如T-Mask在细粒度驾驶员观察中具有强大潜力，特别是在跨视角和低数据设置下，时间token选择对构建鲁棒监控系统至关重要。

Abstract: Changes of camera perspective are a common obstacle in driver monitoring.
While deep learning and pretrained foundation models show strong potential for
improved generalization via lightweight adaptation of the final layers
('probing'), their robustness to unseen viewpoints remains underexplored. We
study this challenge by adapting image foundation models to driver monitoring
using a single training view, and evaluating them directly on unseen
perspectives without further adaptation. We benchmark simple linear probes,
advanced probing strategies, and compare two foundation models (DINOv2 and
CLIP) against parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) and full fine-tuning.
Building on these insights, we introduce \textsc{T-Mask} -- a new
image-to-video probing method that leverages temporal token masking and
emphasizes more dynamic video regions. Benchmarked on the public Drive\&Act
dataset, \textsc{T-Mask} improves cross-view top-1 accuracy by $+1.23\%$ over
strong probing baselines and $+8.0\%$ over PEFT methods, without adding any
parameters. It proves particularly effective for underrepresented secondary
activities, boosting recognition by $+5.42\%$ under the trained view and
$+1.36\%$ under cross-view settings. This work provides encouraging evidence
that adapting foundation models with lightweight probing methods like
\textsc{T-Mask} has strong potential in fine-grained driver observation,
especially in cross-view and low-data settings. These results highlight the
importance of temporal token selection when leveraging foundation models to
build robust driver monitoring systems. Code and models will be made available
at https://github.com/th-nesh/T-MASK to support ongoing research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FoCa方法通过将特征缓存视为特征ODE求解问题，在保持高质量的同时显著加速扩散变换器的推理速度，在多个任务上实现近无损的5-6倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有特征缓存方法在高加速比下难以保持生成质量，预测误差会因长步预测的不稳定性而急剧增加，需要更鲁棒的历史特征整合策略。

Method: 从ODE视角建模隐藏特征序列，将层表示视为特征ODE，提出FoCa（Forecast-then-Calibrate）方法，将特征缓存作为特征ODE求解问题处理。

Result: 在图像合成、视频生成和超分辨率任务上，FoCa实现了显著加速：FLUX 5.50倍、HunyuanVideo 6.45倍、Inf-DiT 3.17倍、DiT 4.53倍，且保持高质量。

Conclusion: FoCa通过ODE视角有效解决了特征缓存在高加速比下的质量退化问题，实现了近无损的推理加速，无需额外训练即可在各种扩散变换器模型上获得显著性能提升。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in
high-fidelity image and video generation. To reduce their substantial
computational costs, feature caching techniques have been proposed to
accelerate inference by reusing hidden representations from previous timesteps.
However, current methods often struggle to maintain generation quality at high
acceleration ratios, where prediction errors increase sharply due to the
inherent instability of long-step forecasting. In this work, we adopt an
ordinary differential equation (ODE) perspective on the hidden-feature
sequence, modeling layer representations along the trajectory as a feature-ODE.
We attribute the degradation of existing caching strategies to their inability
to robustly integrate historical features under large skipping intervals. To
address this, we propose FoCa (Forecast-then-Calibrate), which treats feature
caching as a feature-ODE solving problem. Extensive experiments on image
synthesis, video generation, and super-resolution tasks demonstrate the
effectiveness of FoCa, especially under aggressive acceleration. Without
additional training, FoCa achieves near-lossless speedups of 5.50 times on
FLUX, 6.45 times on HunyuanVideo, 3.17 times on Inf-DiT, and maintains high
quality with a 4.53 times speedup on DiT.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniCache是一种无需训练的加速方法，通过分析扩散模型的采样轨迹和全局冗余性，在去噪过程中智能分布缓存重用，并动态过滤噪声影响，显著提升采样速度同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散Transformer模型虽然性能强大，但由于采样步骤多、计算复杂，计算成本高昂，难以实现实时部署。现有缓存方法基于步骤间相似性，倾向于重用后期采样步骤，效率有限。

Method: 从DIT模型的采样角度出发，系统分析模型采样轨迹，在整个采样过程中战略性分布缓存重用。在缓存重用期间动态估计并过滤相应噪声，减少对采样方向的影响。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在保持竞争力的生成质量的同时，显著加速了采样过程。

Conclusion: OmniCache为基于扩散的生成模型的高效部署提供了一个有前景且实用的解决方案，通过全局视角的缓存策略有效利用了扩散轨迹中的计算冗余。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for generative tasks
such as image synthesis and video generation, with Transformer architectures
further enhancing performance. However, the high computational cost of
diffusion Transformers-stemming from a large number of sampling steps and
complex per-step computations-presents significant challenges for real-time
deployment. In this paper, we introduce OmniCache, a training-free acceleration
method that exploits the global redundancy inherent in the denoising process.
Unlike existing methods that determine caching strategies based on inter-step
similarities and tend to prioritize reusing later sampling steps, our approach
originates from the sampling perspective of DIT models. We systematically
analyze the model's sampling trajectories and strategically distribute cache
reuse across the entire sampling process. This global perspective enables more
effective utilization of cached computations throughout the diffusion
trajectory, rather than concentrating reuse within limited segments of the
sampling procedure.In addition, during cache reuse, we dynamically estimate the
corresponding noise and filter it out to reduce its impact on the sampling
direction.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach accelerates the
sampling process while maintaining competitive generative quality, offering a
promising and practical solution for efficient deployment of diffusion-based
generative models.

TL;DR: MedOmni-45 Degrees是一个医疗LLM基准测试，通过操纵性提示评估模型在准确性、推理忠实性和反奉承性三个维度的安全性能权衡


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在医疗决策支持中的广泛应用，需要评估其推理的可靠性而不仅仅是最终答案，现有基准往往将脆弱性简化为单一准确度分数

Method: 构建包含1,804个医疗问题的基准，涵盖6个专业和3种任务类型，每个问题配以7种操纵性提示类型和无提示基线，共产生约27K输入，评估7个LLM的准确性、推理忠实性和反奉承性三个指标

Result: 结果显示所有模型都存在安全性能权衡，没有模型能超越对角线，开源模型QwQ-32B表现最接近(43.81度)，在安全性和准确性之间取得平衡但都不是最优

Conclusion: MedOmni-45 Degrees提供了一个专注于暴露医疗LLM推理脆弱性的基准，可指导更安全的模型开发

Abstract: With the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in medical
decision-support, it is essential to evaluate not only their final answers but
also the reliability of their reasoning. Two key risks are Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) faithfulness -- whether reasoning aligns with responses and medical facts
-- and sycophancy, where models follow misleading cues over correctness.
Existing benchmarks often collapse such vulnerabilities into single accuracy
scores. To address this, we introduce MedOmni-45 Degrees, a benchmark and
workflow designed to quantify safety-performance trade-offs under manipulative
hint conditions. It contains 1,804 reasoning-focused medical questions across
six specialties and three task types, including 500 from MedMCQA. Each question
is paired with seven manipulative hint types and a no-hint baseline, producing
about 27K inputs. We evaluate seven LLMs spanning open- vs. closed-source,
general-purpose vs. medical, and base vs. reasoning-enhanced models, totaling
over 189K inferences. Three metrics -- Accuracy, CoT-Faithfulness, and
Anti-Sycophancy -- are combined into a composite score visualized with a 45
Degrees plot. Results show a consistent safety-performance trade-off, with no
model surpassing the diagonal. The open-source QwQ-32B performs closest (43.81
Degrees), balancing safety and accuracy but not leading in both. MedOmni-45
Degrees thus provides a focused benchmark for exposing reasoning
vulnerabilities in medical LLMs and guiding safer model development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型的成功使得高质量图像修改变得容易，但同时也带来了被恶意滥用的风险。先前的研究依赖图像级不一致性，存在根本性局限，无法有效处理文本提示的影响。

Method: 利用跨注意力机制，识别并针对提示中不变且语义无信息的共享标记，注入对抗性噪声来抑制采样过程。注入的噪声作为跨注意力诱饵，分散模型对有意义提示-图像对齐的关注。

Result: 在EditBench数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在各种指标上达到最先进性能，同时显著减少计算开销和GPU内存使用。

Conclusion: PromptFlare是一种强大且高效的防护方法，能够有效防止未经授权的图像操作。

Abstract: The success of diffusion models has enabled effortless, high-quality image
modifications that precisely align with users' intentions, thereby raising
concerns about their potential misuse by malicious actors. Previous studies
have attempted to mitigate such misuse through adversarial attacks. However,
these approaches heavily rely on image-level inconsistencies, which pose
fundamental limitations in addressing the influence of textual prompts. In this
paper, we propose PromptFlare, a novel adversarial protection method designed
to protect images from malicious modifications facilitated by diffusion-based
inpainting models. Our approach leverages the cross-attention mechanism to
exploit the intrinsic properties of prompt embeddings. Specifically, we
identify and target shared token of prompts that is invariant and semantically
uninformative, injecting adversarial noise to suppress the sampling process.
The injected noise acts as a cross-attention decoy, diverting the model's focus
away from meaningful prompt-image alignments and thereby neutralizing the
effect of prompt. Extensive experiments on the EditBench dataset demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across various metrics
while significantly reducing computational overhead and GPU memory usage. These
findings highlight PromptFlare as a robust and efficient protection against
unauthorized image manipulations. The code is available at

Abstract: Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) are becoming ubiquitous in computer vision,
powering systems for diverse tasks such as object detection, image
classification, segmentation, pose estimation, and motion tracking. VFMs are
capitalizing on seminal innovations in deep learning models, such as LeNet-5,
AlexNet, ResNet, VGGNet, InceptionNet, DenseNet, YOLO, and ViT, to deliver
superior performance across a range of critical computer vision applications.
These include security-sensitive domains like biometric verification,
autonomous vehicle perception, and medical image analysis, where robustness is
essential to fostering trust between technology and the end-users. This article
investigates network robustness requirements crucial in computer vision systems
to adapt effectively to dynamic environments influenced by factors such as
lighting, weather conditions, and sensor characteristics. We examine the
prevalent empirical defenses and robust training employed to enhance vision
network robustness against real-world challenges such as distributional shifts,
noisy and spatially distorted inputs, and adversarial attacks. Subsequently, we
provide a comprehensive analysis of the challenges associated with these
defense mechanisms, including network properties and components to guide
ablation studies and benchmarking metrics to evaluate network robustness.

Conclusion: FlexMUSE成功解决了多模态创意写作中的语义对齐和创意提升问题，为这一新兴领域提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-modal creative writing (MMCW) aims to produce illustrated articles.
Unlike common multi-modal generative (MMG) tasks such as storytelling or
caption generation, MMCW is an entirely new and more abstract challenge where
textual and visual contexts are not strictly related to each other. Existing
methods for related tasks can be forcibly migrated to this track, but they
require specific modality inputs or costly training, and often suffer from
semantic inconsistencies between modalities. Therefore, the main challenge lies
in economically performing MMCW with flexible interactive patterns, where the
semantics between the modalities of the output are more aligned. In this work,
we propose FlexMUSE with a T2I module to enable optional visual input. FlexMUSE
promotes creativity and emphasizes the unification between modalities by
proposing the modality semantic alignment gating (msaGate) to restrict the
textual input. Besides, an attention-based cross-modality fusion is proposed to
augment the input features for semantic enhancement. The modality semantic
creative direct preference optimization (mscDPO) within FlexMUSE is designed by
extending the rejected samples to facilitate the writing creativity. Moreover,
to advance the MMCW, we expose a dataset called ArtMUSE which contains with
around 3k calibrated text-image pairs. FlexMUSE achieves promising results,
demonstrating its consistency, creativity and coherence.

Abstract: Quantitative microstructural characterization is fundamental to materials
science, where electron micrograph (EM) provides indispensable high-resolution
insights. However, progress in deep learning-based EM characterization has been
hampered by the scarcity of large-scale, diverse, and expert-annotated
datasets, due to acquisition costs, privacy concerns, and annotation
complexity. To address this issue, we introduce UniEM-3M, the first large-scale
and multimodal EM dataset for instance-level understanding. It comprises 5,091
high-resolution EMs, about 3 million instance segmentation labels, and
image-level attribute-disentangled textual descriptions, a subset of which will
be made publicly available. Furthermore, we are also releasing a text-to-image
diffusion model trained on the entire collection to serve as both a powerful
data augmentation tool and a proxy for the complete data distribution. To
establish a rigorous benchmark, we evaluate various representative instance
segmentation methods on the complete UniEM-3M and present UniEM-Net as a strong
baseline model. Quantitative experiments demonstrate that this flow-based model
outperforms other advanced methods on this challenging benchmark. Our
multifaceted release of a partial dataset, a generative model, and a

Method: 提出IAML训练范式，包含基于IoU的坐标采样数据增强管道，考虑与真实坐标的接近程度，用于微调MLLMs

Result: 通过大量实验证明IAML训练方法优于传统训练范式

Conclusion: IAML训练范式有效解决了MLLMs在GUI坐标生成中的挑战，提高了性能

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as pivotal tools in
enhancing human-computer interaction. In this paper we focus on the application
of MLLMs in the field of graphical user interface (GUI) elements structuring,
where they assist in processing user instructions based on screen contents.
Despite the promise of MLLMs, their performance in precisely generating UI
element coordinates, a critical aspect of GUI understanding, is hindered by the
nature of next-token prediction training. This challenge arises from the
semantic void surrounding numerical UI coordinates in language representation
spaces, necessitating a substantial and diverse dataset to bolster visual
module capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce an
IoU-Augmented Maximum Likelihood (IAML) training paradigm. Specifically, our
approach involves a novel pipeline for IoU-based coordinate sampling to augment
the training data, which considers the proximity to ground truth coordinates.
This data augmentation strategy is then employed to fine-tune MLLMs under the
IAML paradigm, which is designed to mitigate the exposure bias problem inherent
in traditional maximum likelihood estimation. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate the superior performance of our IAML training approach over
traditional training paradigms.

Abstract: With the enhancement of remote sensing image resolution and the rapid
advancement of deep learning, land cover mapping is transitioning from
pixel-level segmentation to object-based vector modeling. This shift demands
more from deep learning models, requiring precise object boundaries and
topological consistency. However, existing datasets face three main challenges:
limited class annotations, small data scale, and lack of spatial structural
information. To overcome these issues, we introduce IRSAMap, the first global
remote sensing dataset for large-scale, high-resolution, multi-feature land
cover vector mapping. IRSAMap offers four key advantages: 1) a comprehensive
vector annotation system with over 1.8 million instances of 10 typical objects
(e.g., buildings, roads, rivers), ensuring semantic and spatial accuracy; 2) an
intelligent annotation workflow combining manual and AI-based methods to
improve efficiency and consistency; 3) global coverage across 79 regions in six
continents, totaling over 1,000 km; and 4) multi-task adaptability for tasks
like pixel-level classification, building outline extraction, road centerline
extraction, and panoramic segmentation. IRSAMap provides a standardized
benchmark for the shift from pixel-based to object-based approaches, advancing
geographic feature automation and collaborative modeling. It is valuable for
global geographic information updates and digital twin construction. The

Abstract: This paper tackles the challenging problem of detecting methane plumes, a
potent greenhouse gas, using Sentinel-2 imagery. This contributes to the
mitigation of rapid climate change. We propose a novel deep learning solution
based on U-Net with a ResNet34 encoder, integrating dual spectral enhancement
techniques (Varon ratio and Sanchez regression) to optimise input features for
heightened sensitivity. A key achievement is the ability to detect small plumes
down to 400 m2 (i.e., for a single pixel at 20 m resolution), surpassing
traditional methods limited to larger plumes. Experiments show our approach
achieves a 78.39% F1-score on the validation set, demonstrating superior
performance in sensitivity and precision over existing remote sensing
techniques for automated methane monitoring, especially for small plumes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出双流Mamba金字塔网络，分别处理花样滑冰的技术分(TES)和节目内容分(PCS)评估，通过分离视觉特征和音视频特征流，解决了现有方法的三个主要挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在三个主要问题：1)未考虑评分标准差异，将视频和音频特征混用；2)未对每个技术动作单独评分；3)难以处理长视频的远距离上下文依赖。

Method: 采用双流架构：视觉特征流用于TES评估，音视频融合流用于PCS评估。使用多级融合机制和多尺度Mamba金字塔处理不同时间尺度的动作元素，利用Mamba的线性计算复杂度处理长视频。

Result: 在FineFS基准测试中达到了最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: 该方法与真实评分标准对齐，能有效处理花样滑冰视频的长距离依赖和多尺度动作评估问题，为动作质量评估提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Technical Element Score (TES) and Program Component Score (PCS) evaluations
in figure skating demand precise assessment of athletic actions and artistic
interpretation, respectively. Existing methods face three major challenges.
Firstly, video and audio cues are regarded as common features for both TES and
PCS predictions in previous works without considering the prior evaluation
criterion of figure skating. Secondly, action elements in competitions are
separated in time, TES should be derived from each element's score, but
existing methods try to give an overall TES prediction without evaluating each
action element. Thirdly, lengthy competition videos make it difficult and
inefficient to handle long-range contexts. To address these challenges, we
propose a two-stream Mamba pyramid network that aligns with actual judging
criteria to predict TES and PCS by separating visual-feature based TES
evaluation stream from audio-visual-feature based PCS evaluation stream. In the
PCS evaluation stream, we introduce a multi-level fusion mechanism to guarantee
that video-based features remain unaffected when assessing TES, and enhance PCS
estimation by fusing visual and auditory cues across each contextual level of
the pyramid. In the TES evaluation stream, the multi-scale Mamba pyramid and
TES head we proposed effectively address the challenges of localizing and
evaluating action elements with various temporal scales and give score
predictions. With Mamba's superior ability to capture long-range dependencies
and its linear computational complexity, our method is ideal for handling
lengthy figure skating videos. Comprehensive experimentation demonstrates that
our framework attains state-of-the-art performance on the FineFS benchmark. Our

Abstract: The digitization of handwritten marksheets presents huge challenges due to
the different styles of handwriting and complex table structures in such
documents like marksheets. This work introduces a hybrid method that integrates
OpenCV for table detection and PaddleOCR for recognizing sequential handwritten
text. The image processing capabilities of OpenCV efficiently detects rows and
columns which enable computationally lightweight and accurate table detection.
Additionally, YOLOv8 and Modified YOLOv8 are implemented for handwritten text
recognition within the detected table structures alongside PaddleOCR which
further enhance the system's versatility. The proposed model achieves high
accuracy on our custom dataset which is designed to represent different and
diverse handwriting styles and complex table layouts. Experimental results
demonstrate that YOLOv8 Modified achieves an accuracy of 92.72 percent,
outperforming PaddleOCR 91.37 percent and the YOLOv8 model 88.91 percent. This
efficiency reduces the necessity for manual work which makes this a practical
and fast solution for digitizing academic as well as administrative documents.
This research serves the field of document automation, particularly handwritten
document understanding, by providing operational and reliable methods to scale,
enhance, and integrate the technologies involved.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MM-ORIENT框架，通过跨模态关系图和分层交互注意力机制，在不进行显式模态交互的情况下获得多模态表示，减少噪声影响并保留单模态判别信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习中存在单模态噪声问题，传统融合方法可能忽视单模态的判别信息，需要一种既能减少噪声影响又能保留重要特征的方法。

Method: 使用跨模态关系图重构单模态特征来获取多模态表示，基于不同模态特征决定邻域关系；提出分层交互单模态注意力(HIMA)机制来关注模态内重要信息。

Result: 在三个数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法能有效理解多模态内容并适用于多任务。

Conclusion: MM-ORIENT框架通过非显式交互的跨模态关系学习和分层注意力机制，成功解决了多模态学习中的噪声问题和信息保留挑战。

Abstract: A major challenge in multimodal learning is the presence of noise within
individual modalities. This noise inherently affects the resulting multimodal
representations, especially when these representations are obtained through
explicit interactions between different modalities. Moreover, the multimodal
fusion techniques while aiming to achieve a strong joint representation, can
neglect valuable discriminative information within the individual modalities.
To this end, we propose a Multimodal-Multitask framework with crOss-modal
Relation and hIErarchical iNteractive aTtention (MM-ORIENT) that is effective
for multiple tasks. The proposed approach acquires multimodal representations
cross-modally without explicit interaction between different modalities,
reducing the noise effect at the latent stage. To achieve this, we propose
cross-modal relation graphs that reconstruct monomodal features to acquire
multimodal representations. The features are reconstructed based on the node
neighborhood, where the neighborhood is decided by the features of a different
modality. We also propose Hierarchical Interactive Monomadal Attention (HIMA)
to focus on pertinent information within a modality. While cross-modal relation
graphs help comprehend high-order relationships between two modalities, HIMA
helps in multitasking by learning discriminative features of individual
modalities before late-fusing them. Finally, extensive experimental evaluation
on three datasets demonstrates that the proposed approach effectively
comprehends multimodal content for multiple tasks.

TL;DR: 提出EAM方法，通过分析注意力图的熵值来识别冗余信息，冻结低熵注意力图并用低精度量化，在保持精度的同时减少计算和内存需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型的多头自注意力机制计算复杂且内存需求高，阻碍了在边缘设备上的部署。研究发现低熵的注意力头贡献信息较少，存在冗余，为针对性压缩提供了动机。

Method: 使用香农熵量化每个注意力头的信息量，识别低熵注意力图，冻结其权重并用低精度量化以避免冗余重计算。

Result: 在ImageNet-1k上验证，EAM在注意力图稀疏度≤20%时达到相似或更高精度，在更高稀疏度下仍保持竞争力，适用于DeiT和Swin Transformer模型。

Conclusion: 基于熵分析的注意力图压缩策略能有效减少计算和内存开销，同时保持模型性能，为边缘部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Transformer models rely on Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) mechanisms, where
each attention head contributes to the final representation. However, their
computational complexity and high memory demands due to MHSA hinders their
deployment at the edge. In this work, we analyze and exploit information
redundancy in attention maps to accelerate model inference. By quantifying the
information captured by each attention head using Shannon entropy, our analysis
reveals that attention heads with lower entropy, i.e., exhibiting more
deterministic behavior, tend to contribute less information, motivating
targeted compression strategies. Relying on these insights, we propose Entropy
Attention Maps (EAM), a model that freezes the weights of low-entropy attention
maps and quantizes these values to low precision to avoid redundant
re-computation. Empirical validation on ImageNet-1k shows that EAM achieves
similar or higher accuracy at $\leq$20\% sparsity in attention maps and
competitive performance beyond this level for the DeiT and Swin Transformer
models.

<details>

Motivation: 受生物视觉效率行为的启发，现代视觉编码器在处理大量视觉数据时缺乏效率，需要根据任务动态分配有限的计算资源。

Method: 提出图像大小无关和任务驱动的视觉编码器概念，并为图像分类任务提供了概念验证解决方案。

Result: 证明了该方法的可行性和潜力，尽管分类任务并不能完全代表所要实现的目标。

Conclusion: 下一代视觉编码器应该采用动态计算复杂度方案，根据任务需求调整计算资源分配，而非固定地依赖图像大小。

Abstract: This position paper argues that the next generation of vision encoders should
be image size agnostic and task driven. The source of our inspiration is
biological. Not a structural aspect of biological vision, but a behavioral
trait -- efficiency. We focus on a couple of ways in which vision in nature is
efficient, but modern vision encoders not. We -- humans and animals -- deal
with vast quantities of visual data, and need to be smart where we focus our
limited energy -- it depends on the task. It is our belief that vision encoders
should be dynamic and the computational complexity should depend on the task at
hand rather than the size of the image. We, also, provide concrete first steps
towards our vision -- a proof-of-concept solution for image classification.
Despite classification being not very representative for what we are trying to
achieve, it shows that our approach is feasible and promising.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示Randomized Time Warping (RTW)与自注意力机制的相似性，探索两者在序列模式处理中的内在联系

Method: 将RTW解释为自注意力机制，分析两者的权重模式相似性，比较全局注意力与局部注意力的差异

Result: RTW与自注意力权重模式高度相似（平均相关性0.80），RTW在Something-Something V2数据集上性能提升5%

Conclusion: RTW可视为一种全局自注意力机制，相比Transformer的局部注意力具有性能优势

Abstract: This paper reveals that we can interpret the fundamental function of
Randomized Time Warping (RTW) as a type of self-attention mechanism, a core
technology of Transformers in motion recognition. The self-attention is a
mechanism that enables models to identify and weigh the importance of different
parts of an input sequential pattern. On the other hand, RTW is a general
extension of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), a technique commonly used for matching
and comparing sequential patterns. In essence, RTW searches for optimal
contribution weights for each element of the input sequential patterns to
produce discriminative features. Although the two approaches look different,
these contribution weights can be interpreted as self-attention weights. In
fact, the two weight patterns look similar, producing a high average
correlation of 0.80 across the ten smallest canonical angles. However, they
work in different ways: RTW attention operates on an entire input sequential
pattern, while self-attention focuses on only a local view which is a subset of
the input sequential pattern because of the computational costs of the
self-attention matrix. This targeting difference leads to an advantage of RTW
against Transformer, as demonstrated by the 5\% performance improvement on the
Something-Something V2 dataset.

Conclusion: GMBINet在保持竞争力的准确率同时实现了实时性能，展示了在工业视觉应用中超越表面缺陷检测的潜力，为资源受限环境提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Real-time surface defect detection is critical for maintaining product
quality and production efficiency in the steel manufacturing industry. Despite
promising accuracy, existing deep learning methods often suffer from high
computational complexity and slow inference speeds, which limit their
deployment in resource-constrained industrial environments. Recent lightweight
approaches adopt multibranch architectures based on depthwise separable
convolution (DSConv) to capture multiscale contextual information. However,
these methods often suffer from increased computational overhead and lack
effective cross-scale feature interaction, limiting their ability to fully
leverage multiscale representations. To address these challenges, we propose
GMBINet, a lightweight framework that enhances multiscale feature extraction
and interaction through novel Group Multiscale Bidirectional Interactive (GMBI)
modules. The GMBI adopts a group-wise strategy for multiscale feature
extraction, ensuring scale-agnostic computational complexity. It further
integrates a Bidirectional Progressive Feature Interactor (BPFI) and a
parameter-free Element-Wise Multiplication-Summation (EWMS) operation to
enhance cross-scale interaction without introducing additional computational
overhead. Experiments on SD-Saliency-900 and NRSD-MN datasets demonstrate that
GMBINet delivers competitive accuracy with real-time speeds of 1048 FPS on GPU
and 16.53 FPS on CPU at 512 resolution, using only 0.19 M parameters.
Additional evaluations on the NEU-CLS defect classification dataset further
confirm the strong generalization ability of our method, demonstrating its
potential for broader industrial vision applications beyond surface defect
detection. The dataset and code are publicly available at:

Abstract: Multimodal sensor fusion is an essential capability for autonomous robots,
enabling object detection and decision-making in the presence of failing or
uncertain inputs. While recent fusion methods excel in normal environmental
conditions, these approaches fail in adverse weather, e.g., heavy fog, snow, or
obstructions due to soiling. We introduce a novel multi-sensor fusion approach
tailored to adverse weather conditions. In addition to fusing RGB and LiDAR
sensors, which are employed in recent autonomous driving literature, our sensor
fusion stack is also capable of learning from NIR gated camera and radar
modalities to tackle low light and inclement weather. We fuse multimodal sensor
data through attentive, depth-based blending schemes, with learned refinement
on the Bird's Eye View (BEV) plane to combine image and range features
effectively. Our detections are predicted by a transformer decoder that weighs
modalities based on distance and visibility. We demonstrate that our method
improves the reliability of multimodal sensor fusion in autonomous vehicles
under challenging weather conditions, bridging the gap between ideal conditions
and real-world edge cases. Our approach improves average precision by 17.2 AP
compared to the next best method for vulnerable pedestrians in long distances

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如DUSt3R和MASt3R主要针对静态室外场景，难以处理以人为中心的场景，需要开发能够同时重建人体和场景的3D重建方法。

Method: 使用DUNE图像编码器（融合MASt3R和multi-HMR编码器），添加网络头进行人体分割、DensePose密集对应关系估计和深度预测，生成包含人体语义信息的密集3D点云。

Conclusion: HAMSt3R填补了人体与场景理解之间的空白，提供完全前馈的高效解决方案，适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: Recovering the 3D geometry of a scene from a sparse set of uncalibrated
images is a long-standing problem in computer vision. While recent
learning-based approaches such as DUSt3R and MASt3R have demonstrated
impressive results by directly predicting dense scene geometry, they are
primarily trained on outdoor scenes with static environments and struggle to
handle human-centric scenarios. In this work, we introduce HAMSt3R, an
extension of MASt3R for joint human and scene 3D reconstruction from sparse,
uncalibrated multi-view images. First, we exploit DUNE, a strong image encoder
obtained by distilling, among others, the encoders from MASt3R and from a
state-of-the-art Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) model, multi-HMR, for a better
understanding of scene geometry and human bodies. Our method then incorporates
additional network heads to segment people, estimate dense correspondences via
DensePose, and predict depth in human-centric environments, enabling a more
comprehensive 3D reconstruction. By leveraging the outputs of our different
heads, HAMSt3R produces a dense point map enriched with human semantic
information in 3D. Unlike existing methods that rely on complex optimization
pipelines, our approach is fully feed-forward and efficient, making it suitable
for real-world applications. We evaluate our model on EgoHumans and EgoExo4D,
two challenging benchmarks con taining diverse human-centric scenarios.
Additionally, we validate its generalization to traditional multi-view stereo
and multi-view pose regression tasks. Our results demonstrate that our method
can reconstruct humans effectively while preserving strong performance in
general 3D reconstruction tasks, bridging the gap between human and scene
understanding in 3D vision.

Abstract: Hand-object 3D reconstruction has become increasingly important for
applications in human-robot interaction and immersive AR/VR experiences. A
common approach for object-agnostic hand-object reconstruction from RGB
sequences involves a two-stage pipeline: hand-object 3D tracking followed by
multi-view 3D reconstruction. However, existing methods rely on keypoint
detection techniques, such as Structure from Motion (SfM) and hand-keypoint
optimization, which struggle with diverse object geometries, weak textures, and
mutual hand-object occlusions, limiting scalability and generalization. As a
key enabler to generic and seamless, non-intrusive applicability, we propose in
this work a robust, keypoint detector-free approach to estimating hand-object
3D transformations from monocular motion video/images. We further integrate
this with a multi-view reconstruction pipeline to accurately recover
hand-object 3D shape. Our method, named HOSt3R, is unconstrained, does not rely
on pre-scanned object templates or camera intrinsics, and reaches
state-of-the-art performance for the tasks of object-agnostic hand-object 3D
transformation and shape estimation on the SHOWMe benchmark. We also experiment
on sequences from the HO3D dataset, demonstrating generalization to unseen
object categories.

Motivation: 现有3DGS超分辨率方法只能处理固定尺度因子，无法适应资源受限场景。直接渲染任意尺度会引入混叠伪影，而添加后处理上采样器会降低渲染效率。

Method: 构建集成框架，包含尺度感知渲染、生成先验引导优化和渐进式超分辨率技术，支持整数和非整数尺度渲染。

Conclusion: 该方法为3D高斯泼溅提供了灵活高效的任意尺度超分辨率解决方案，在保持渲染效率的同时显著提升图像质量。

Abstract: Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) super-resolution methods typically
perform high-resolution (HR) rendering of fixed scale factors, making them
impractical for resource-limited scenarios. Directly rendering arbitrary-scale
HR views with vanilla 3DGS introduces aliasing artifacts due to the lack of
scale-aware rendering ability, while adding a post-processing upsampler for
3DGS complicates the framework and reduces rendering efficiency. To tackle
these issues, we build an integrated framework that incorporates scale-aware
rendering, generative prior-guided optimization, and progressive
super-resolving to enable 3D Gaussian super-resolution of arbitrary scale
factors with a single 3D model. Notably, our approach supports both integer and
non-integer scale rendering to provide more flexibility. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in rendering high-quality
arbitrary-scale HR views (6.59 dB PSNR gain over 3DGS) with a single model. It
preserves structural consistency with LR views and across different scales,
while maintaining real-time rendering speed (85 FPS at 1080p).

Result: 微调使模型优先考虑表面真实感而非动态准确性，持续学习策略能在保持空间准确性的同时维持良好视觉质量

Conclusion: 驾驶场景的特殊性导致视频生成微调中的权衡问题，需要开发平衡视觉质量和动态准确性的方法

Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation have substantially improved visual
quality and temporal coherence, making these models increasingly appealing for
applications such as autonomous driving, particularly in the context of driving
simulation and so-called "world models". In this work, we investigate the
effects of existing fine-tuning video generation approaches on structured
driving datasets and uncover a potential trade-off: although visual fidelity
improves, spatial accuracy in modeling dynamic elements may degrade. We
attribute this degradation to a shift in the alignment between visual quality
and dynamic understanding objectives. In datasets with diverse scene structures
within temporal space, where objects or perspective shift in varied ways, these
objectives tend to highly correlated. However, the very regular and repetitive
nature of driving scenes allows visual quality to improve by modeling dominant
scene motion patterns, without necessarily preserving fine-grained dynamic
behavior. As a result, fine-tuning encourages the model to prioritize
surface-level realism over dynamic accuracy. To further examine this
phenomenon, we show that simple continual learning strategies, such as replay

Motivation: 计算机视觉领域长期以来形成了高度专业化的细分领域，随着各任务的成功和研究进展，需要将这些日益复杂的感知任务进行整合和统一。

Method: 通过系统性的文献综述，从基础视觉子领域的历史出发，涵盖关键概念、方法论和数据集，分析从显著性检测、前景/背景分离到开放世界目标检测等多个子领域的重叠与融合趋势。

Abstract: For decades, Computer Vision has aimed at enabling machines to perceive the
external world. Initial limitations led to the development of highly
specialized niches. As success in each task accrued and research progressed,
increasingly complex perception tasks emerged. This survey charts the
convergence of these tasks and, in doing so, introduces Open World Detection
(OWD), an umbrella term we propose to unify class-agnostic and generally
applicable detection models in the vision domain. We start from the history of
foundational vision subdomains and cover key concepts, methodologies and
datasets making up today's state-of-the-art landscape. This traverses topics
starting from early saliency detection, foreground/background separation, out
of distribution detection and leading up to open world object detection,
zero-shot detection and Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs). We explore the
overlap between these subdomains, their increasing convergence, and their
potential to unify into a singular domain in the future, perception.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MV-RAG是一个新颖的文本到3D生成管道，通过检索相关2D图像并基于这些图像条件化多视角扩散模型，显著改善了OOD/罕见概念的3D一致性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到3D生成方法在处理域外(OOD)或罕见概念时往往产生不一致或不准确的结果，需要一种能够利用真实世界2D图像数据来提升3D生成质量的方法。

Method: 提出MV-RAG管道：1）从大规模2D图像数据库中检索相关图像；2）训练检索条件化的多视角扩散模型；3）采用混合训练策略，结合多视角数据和真实2D图像集；4）使用保持视角预测目标来从2D数据推断3D一致性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在OOD/罕见概念上显著改善了3D一致性、照片真实感和文本遵循度，同时在标准基准测试中保持竞争力。

Conclusion: MV-RAG通过有效利用检索到的2D图像信息，成功解决了文本到3D生成中OOD概念的挑战，为3D内容生成提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-3D generation approaches have advanced significantly by leveraging
pretrained 2D diffusion priors, producing high-quality and 3D-consistent
outputs. However, they often fail to produce out-of-domain (OOD) or rare
concepts, yielding inconsistent or inaccurate results. To this end, we propose
MV-RAG, a novel text-to-3D pipeline that first retrieves relevant 2D images
from a large in-the-wild 2D database and then conditions a multiview diffusion
model on these images to synthesize consistent and accurate multiview outputs.
Training such a retrieval-conditioned model is achieved via a novel hybrid
strategy bridging structured multiview data and diverse 2D image collections.
This involves training on multiview data using augmented conditioning views
that simulate retrieval variance for view-specific reconstruction, alongside
training on sets of retrieved real-world 2D images using a distinctive held-out
view prediction objective: the model predicts the held-out view from the other
views to infer 3D consistency from 2D data. To facilitate a rigorous OOD
evaluation, we introduce a new collection of challenging OOD prompts.
Experiments against state-of-the-art text-to-3D, image-to-3D, and
personalization baselines show that our approach significantly improves 3D
consistency, photorealism, and text adherence for OOD/rare concepts, while
maintaining competitive performance on standard benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了RFSQ框架解决FSQ在残差量化中的信号衰减问题，通过可学习缩放因子和可逆LayerNorm两种条件策略，显著提升了量化性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FSQ在残差量化框架中存在残差幅度衰减问题，后续FSQ层接收的信号逐渐减弱，限制了其有效性

Method: 提出了Robust Residual Finite Scalar Quantization (RFSQ)框架，包含两种新颖的条件策略：可学习缩放因子和可逆层归一化

Result: 在ImageNet上的实验显示，RFSQ变体显著优于VQ-EMA、FSQ和LFQ等基线方法，感知损失改善45%，L1重建误差降低28.7%

Conclusion: RFSQ在保持FSQ简单性的同时实现了有效的多阶段残差量化，LayerNorm策略在不同配置下表现最一致，成为神经压缩的优越量化方法

Abstract: Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ) has emerged as a promising alternative to
Vector Quantization (VQ) in neural compression, offering simplified training
and improved stability. However, naive application of FSQ in residual
quantization frameworks suffers from the \textbf{residual magnitude decay
problem}, where subsequent FSQ layers receive progressively weaker signals,
severely limiting their effectiveness. We propose \textbf{Robust Residual
Finite Scalar Quantization (RFSQ)}, a general framework that addresses this
fundamental limitation through two novel conditioning strategies: learnable
scaling factors and invertible layer normalization. Our approach maintains the
simplicity of FSQ while enabling effective multi-stage residual quantization.
Comprehensive experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that RFSQ variants
significantly outperform strong baselines including VQ-EMA, FSQ, and LFQ,
achieving up to 45\% improvement in perceptual loss and 28.7\% reduction in L1
reconstruction error. The proposed LayerNorm strategy shows the most consistent
improvements across different configurations, establishing RFSQ as a superior
quantization method for neural compression.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 将BOGA方法从梯度回波序列扩展到TSE序列，在7T MRI上使用并行发射系统获得均匀的T1、T2和质子密度加权图像，消除场不均匀性影响


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决7T高场MRI中存在的发射和接收场不均匀性问题，这些不均匀性会影响TSE序列的图像对比度质量

Method: 采用并行发射系统获取具有互补RF模式和扫描参数的多组TSE图像作为输入，通过BOGA方法处理不同数据子集来生成均匀对比度图像

Result: 成功获得了均匀的T1、T2和质子密度加权图像，消除了场不均匀性效应，同时解决了TSE采集的混合对比效应

Conclusion: BOGA方法的TSE应用能够在7T下获得均匀的对比度图像，无需任何先验数据采集即可消除不均匀性影响

Abstract: Purpose: Bilateral Orthogonality Generative Acquisitions (BOGA) method, which
was initially implemented for T_2^* contrast via gradient echo acquisitions, is
adapted for TSE imaging at 7T using parallel transmission (pTx) system for
obtaining homogeneous T_1, T_2 and proton density weighted images. Theory and
Methods: Multiple TSE images with complimentary RF modes and scan parameters
are acquired as input images for the BOGA method where RF modes have
complimentary transmit and receive field inhomogeneity patterns and scan
parameters have varying echo and repetition times. With the application of the
BOGA method using different subsets of the data acquisitions for each contrast,
homogeneous T_1, T_2 and proton density contrast in the final images obtained.
Furthermore, to demonstrate the effect of the TSE factor, two TSE factors are
used individually. Normalized intensity profiles and signal to noise ratio maps
are utilized for the comparison of the CP mode images and the TSE factors
respectively.
  Results: Homogeneous T_1, T_2 and proton density weighted images are obtained
with the TSE implementation of the BOGA method without the transmit and receive
field inhomogeneity effects. Furthermore, mixed contrast effects of the TSE
acquisition are simultaneously resolved independently of the TSE factor.
  Conclusion: TSE application of BOGA method results in homogeneous T_1, T_2
and proton density contrasts at 7T, as the inhomogeneity effects are removed
from the final contrast without any prior data acquisitions.

Abstract: Understanding the dynamic organization and homeostasis of living tissues
requires high-resolution, time-resolved imaging coupled with methods capable of
extracting interpretable, predictive insights from complex datasets. Here, we
present the Vision Transformer Digital Twin Surrogate Network (VT-DTSN), a deep
learning framework for predictive modeling of 3D+T imaging data from biological
tissue. By leveraging Vision Transformers pretrained with DINO
(Self-Distillation with NO Labels) and employing a multi-view fusion strategy,
VT-DTSN learns to reconstruct high-fidelity, time-resolved dynamics of a
Drosophila midgut while preserving morphological and feature-level integrity
across imaging depths. The model is trained with a composite loss prioritizing
pixel-level accuracy, perceptual structure, and feature-space alignment,
ensuring biologically meaningful outputs suitable for in silico experimentation
and hypothesis testing. Evaluation across layers and biological replicates
demonstrates VT-DTSN's robustness and consistency, achieving low error rates
and high structural similarity while maintaining efficient inference through
model optimization. This work establishes VT-DTSN as a feasible, high-fidelity
surrogate for cross-timepoint reconstruction and for studying tissue dynamics,
enabling computational exploration of cellular behaviors and homeostasis to
complement time-resolved imaging studies in biological research.

Abstract: Supervised learning techniques have proven their efficacy in many
applications with abundant data. However, applying these methods to medical
imaging is challenging due to the scarcity of data, given the high acquisition
costs and intricate data characteristics of those images, thereby limiting the
full potential of deep neural networks. To address the lack of data,
augmentation techniques leverage geometry, color, and the synthesis ability of
generative models (GMs). Despite previous efforts, gaps in the generation
process limit the impact of data augmentation to improve understanding of
medical images, e.g., the highly structured nature of some domains, such as
X-ray images, is ignored. Current GMs rely solely on the network's capacity to
blindly synthesize augmentations that preserve semantic relationships of chest
X-ray images, such as anatomical restrictions, representative structures, or
structural similarities consistent across datasets. In this paper, we introduce
a novel GM that leverages the structural resemblance of medical images by
learning a latent graph representation (LGR). We design an end-to-end model to
learn (i) a LGR that captures the intrinsic structure of X-ray images and (ii)
a graph convolutional network (GCN) that reconstructs the X-ray image from the
LGR. We employ adversarial training to guide the generator and discriminator
models in learning the distribution of the learned LGR. Using the learned GCN,
our approach generates structure-preserving synthetic images by mapping
generated LGRs to X-ray. Additionally, we evaluate the learned graph
representation for other tasks, such as X-ray image classification and
segmentation. Numerical experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our approach,
increasing performance up to $3\%$ and $2\%$ for classification and
segmentation, respectively.

Conclusion: CAMP框架能改善MRI数据解读，为胶质母细胞瘤患者提供更个性化的治疗策略，展示了在医学影像分析中的重要应用潜力

Abstract: Glioblastomas, constituting over 50% of malignant brain tumors, are highly
aggressive brain tumors that pose substantial treatment challenges due to their
rapid progression and resistance to standard therapies. The methylation status
of the O-6-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase (MGMT) gene is a critical
biomarker for predicting patient response to treatment, particularly with the
alkylating agent temozolomide. However, accurately predicting MGMT methylation
status using non-invasive imaging techniques remains challenging due to the
complex and heterogeneous nature of glioblastomas, that includes, uneven
contrast, variability within lesions, and irregular enhancement patterns. This
study introduces the Convolutional Autoencoders for MGMT Methylation Status
Prediction (CAMP) framework, which is based on adaptive sparse penalties to
enhance predictive accuracy. The CAMP framework operates in two phases: first,
generating synthetic MRI slices through a tailored autoencoder that effectively
captures and preserves intricate tissue and tumor structures across different
MRI modalities; second, predicting MGMT methylation status using a
convolutional neural network enhanced by adaptive sparse penalties. The
adaptive sparse penalty dynamically adjusts to variations in the data, such as
contrast differences and tumor locations in MR images. Our method excels in MRI
image synthesis, preserving brain tissue, fat, and individual tumor structures
across all MRI modalities. Validated on benchmark datasets, CAMP achieved an
accuracy of 0.97, specificity of 0.98, and sensitivity of 0.97, significantly
outperforming existing methods. These results demonstrate the potential of the
CAMP framework to improve the interpretation of MRI data and contribute to more
personalized treatment strategies for glioblastoma patients.

Abstract: Histopathology remains the gold standard for cancer diagnosis and prognosis.
With the advent of transcriptome profiling, multi-modal learning combining
transcriptomics with histology offers more comprehensive information. However,
existing multi-modal approaches are challenged by intrinsic multi-modal
heterogeneity, insufficient multi-scale integration, and reliance on paired
data, restricting clinical applicability. To address these challenges, we
propose a disentangled multi-modal framework with four contributions: 1) To
mitigate multi-modal heterogeneity, we decompose WSIs and transcriptomes into
tumor and microenvironment subspaces using a disentangled multi-modal fusion
module, and introduce a confidence-guided gradient coordination strategy to
balance subspace optimization. 2) To enhance multi-scale integration, we
propose an inter-magnification gene-expression consistency strategy that aligns
transcriptomic signals across WSI magnifications. 3) To reduce dependency on
paired data, we propose a subspace knowledge distillation strategy enabling
transcriptome-agnostic inference through a WSI-only student model. 4) To
improve inference efficiency, we propose an informative token aggregation
module that suppresses WSI redundancy while preserving subspace semantics.
Extensive experiments on cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and survival prediction
demonstrate our superiority over state-of-the-art methods across multiple
settings. Code is available at

Conclusion: TADSR方法通过时间感知机制有效解决了固定时间步的限制，在Real-ISR任务中实现了更好的性能和对生成结果的可控性

Abstract: Diffusion-based real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) methods have
demonstrated impressive performance. To achieve efficient Real-ISR, many works
employ Variational Score Distillation (VSD) to distill pre-trained
stable-diffusion (SD) model for one-step SR with a fixed timestep. However, due
to the different noise injection timesteps, the SD will perform different
generative priors. Therefore, a fixed timestep is difficult for these methods
to fully leverage the generative priors in SD, leading to suboptimal
performance. To address this, we propose a Time-Aware one-step Diffusion
Network for Real-ISR (TADSR). We first introduce a Time-Aware VAE Encoder,
which projects the same image into different latent features based on
timesteps. Through joint dynamic variation of timesteps and latent features,
the student model can better align with the input pattern distribution of the
pre-trained SD, thereby enabling more effective utilization of SD's generative
capabilities. To better activate the generative prior of SD at different
timesteps, we propose a Time-Aware VSD loss that bridges the timesteps of the
student model and those of the teacher model, thereby producing more consistent
generative prior guidance conditioned on timesteps. Additionally, though
utilizing the generative prior in SD at different timesteps, our method can
naturally achieve controllable trade-offs between fidelity and realism by
changing the timestep condition. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method achieves both state-of-the-art performance and controllable SR results
with only a single step.

Abstract: The non-invasive assessment of increasingly incidentally discovered renal
masses is a critical challenge in urologic oncology, where diagnostic
uncertainty frequently leads to the overtreatment of benign or indolent tumors.
In this study, we developed and validated RenalCLIP using a dataset of 27,866
CT scans from 8,809 patients across nine Chinese medical centers and the public
TCIA cohort, a visual-language foundation model for characterization, diagnosis
and prognosis of renal mass. The model was developed via a two-stage
pre-training strategy that first enhances the image and text encoders with
domain-specific knowledge before aligning them through a contrastive learning
objective, to create robust representations for superior generalization and
diagnostic precision. RenalCLIP achieved better performance and superior
generalizability across 10 core tasks spanning the full clinical workflow of
kidney cancer, including anatomical assessment, diagnostic classification, and
survival prediction, compared with other state-of-the-art general-purpose CT
foundation models. Especially, for complicated task like recurrence-free
survival prediction in the TCIA cohort, RenalCLIP achieved a C-index of 0.726,
representing a substantial improvement of approximately 20% over the leading
baselines. Furthermore, RenalCLIP's pre-training imparted remarkable data
efficiency; in the diagnostic classification task, it only needs 20% training
data to achieve the peak performance of all baseline models even after they
were fully fine-tuned on 100% of the data. Additionally, it achieved superior
performance in report generation, image-text retrieval and zero-shot diagnosis
tasks. Our findings establish that RenalCLIP provides a robust tool with the
potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy, refine prognostic stratification, and
personalize the management of patients with kidney cancer.

Abstract: Brightfield microscopy imaging of unstained live cells remains a persistent
challenge due to low contrast, temporal changes in specimen phenotypes,
irregular illumination, and the absence of training labels. While deep learning
(DL) methods (e.g., Cellpose 3.0) achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance,
they require extensive labeled data and heavy computational resources, and they
often fail under uneven illumination. We present the first unsupervised
segmentation framework combining spatial standard deviation from local mean
(SSDLM), fuzzy logic, adjusted variograms, Moran's I, and cumulative squared
shift of nodal intensity (CSSNI) to address these limitations. Unlike deep
learning models, our approach requires no annotations or retraining and
operates through a user-friendly GUI tailored for non-programming users. The
robustness and generality were validated on three datasets, including
cross-domain data. We benchmark our method against 2023--2024 SOTA models,
including Cellpose 3.0 and StarDist, using a dataset of unstained myoblast
images. Our method achieves a significant improvement in segmentation
performance, with an IoU increase of up to 48\% and statistically validated
superiority ($p < 0.01$, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Expert evaluation from two
biologists further supports the segmentation quality (Cohen's $\kappa > 0.75$).
The proposed algorithm is lightweight, interpretable, and computationally
efficient, offering a practical and effective alternative for cell segmentation
in label-free microscopy. The code, the dataset, and the results are available
for reproducibility*.

Abstract: A precise assessment of the risk of breast lesions can greatly lower it and
assist physicians in choosing the best course of action. To categorise breast
lesions, the majority of current computer-aided systems only use
characteristics from mammograms. Although this method is practical, it does not
completely utilise clinical reports' valuable information to attain the best
results. When compared to utilising mammography alone, will clinical features
greatly enhance the categorisation of breast lesions? How may clinical features
and mammograms be combined most effectively? In what ways may explainable AI
approaches improve the interpretability and reliability of models used to
diagnose breast cancer? To answer these basic problems, a comprehensive
investigation is desperately needed. In order to integrate mammography and
categorical clinical characteristics, this study examines a number of
multimodal deep networks grounded on feature concatenation, co-attention, and
cross-attention. The model achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.98, accuracy of 0.96,
F1-score of 0.94, precision of 0.92, and recall of 0.95 when tested on publicly

Abstract: Stroke is among the top three causes of death worldwide, and accurate
identification of ischemic stroke lesion boundaries from imaging is critical
for diagnosis and treatment. The main imaging modalities used include magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI), particularly diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), and
computed tomography (CT)-based techniques such as non-contrast CT (NCCT),
contrast-enhanced CT angiography (CTA), and CT perfusion (CTP). DWI is the gold
standard for the identification of lesions but has limited applicability in
low-resource settings due to prohibitive costs. CT-based imaging is currently
the most practical imaging method in low-resource settings due to low costs and
simplified logistics, but lacks the high specificity of MRI-based methods in
monitoring ischemic insults. Supervised deep learning methods are the leading
solution for automated ischemic stroke lesion segmentation and provide an
opportunity to improve diagnostic quality in low-resource settings by
incorporating insights from DWI when segmenting from CT. Here, we develop a
series of models which use CT images taken upon arrival as inputs to predict
follow-up lesion volumes annotated from DWI taken 2-9 days later. Furthermore,
we implement clinically motivated preprocessing steps and show that the
proposed pipeline results in a 38% improvement in Dice score over 10 folds
compared to a nnU-Net model trained with the baseline preprocessing. Finally,
we demonstrate that through additional preprocessing of CTA maps to extract
vessel segmentations, we further improve our best model by 21% over 5 folds.

TL;DR: 通过SVD分解将3D LUT分解为低维度LUT的线性组合，减少参数数量和运行时间，同时保持空间感知能力和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统3D LUT方法缺乏空间信息的问题，以及现有空间感知方法参数多、运行时间长的缺点。

Method: 使用奇异值分解(SVD)将3D LUT分解为低维度LUT的线性组合，并改进空间特征融合模块的缓存效率。

Result: 实验结果显示方法能够有效减少参数数量和运行时间，同时保持空间感知能力和性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过LUT分解和缓存效率优化，在保持图像增强性能的同时大幅提升了效率。

Abstract: The image enhancement methods based on 3D lookup tables (3D LUTs) efficiently
reduce both model size and runtime by interpolating pre-calculated values at
the vertices. However, the 3D LUT methods have a limitation due to their lack
of spatial information, as they convert color values on a point-by-point basis.
Although spatial-aware 3D LUT methods address this limitation, they introduce
additional modules that require a substantial number of parameters, leading to
increased runtime as image resolution increases. To address this issue, we
propose a method for generating image-adaptive LUTs by focusing on the
redundant parts of the tables. Our efficient framework decomposes a 3D LUT into
a linear sum of low-dimensional LUTs and employs singular value decomposition
(SVD). Furthermore, we enhance the modules for spatial feature fusion to be
more cache-efficient. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our model
effectively decreases both the number of parameters and runtime while
maintaining spatial awareness and performance.

Motivation: 传统方法在粒子分割中遇到形态变异性和粒子接触的挑战，而有监督深度学习需要耗时的手动标注

Method: 提出自验证学习框架，利用隐式边界检测和重新扩敌扫描来迭代精炼训练集，减少噪声偏标签的影响

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模多粒子样品的无损三维成像提供了高效、准确的分割解决方案，已集成到Biomedisa平台

Abstract: Non-destructive 3D imaging of large multi-particulate samples is essential
for quantifying particle-level properties, such as size, shape, and spatial
distribution, across applications in mining, materials science, and geology.
However, accurate instance segmentation of particles in tomographic data
remains challenging due to high morphological variability and frequent particle
contact, which limit the effectiveness of classical methods like watershed
algorithms. While supervised deep learning approaches offer improved
performance, they rely on extensive annotated datasets that are
labor-intensive, error-prone, and difficult to scale. In this work, we propose
self-validated learning, a novel self-training framework for particle instance
segmentation that eliminates the need for manual annotations. Our method
leverages implicit boundary detection and iteratively refines the training set
by identifying particles that can be consistently matched across reshuffled
scans of the same sample. This self-validation mechanism mitigates the impact
of noisy pseudo-labels, enabling robust learning from unlabeled data. After
just three iterations, our approach accurately segments over 97% of the total
particle volume and identifies more than 54,000 individual particles in
tomographic scans of quartz fragments. Importantly, the framework also enables
fully autonomous model evaluation without the need for ground truth
annotations, as confirmed through comparisons with state-of-the-art instance
segmentation techniques. The method is integrated into the Biomedisa image
analysis platform (https://github.com/biomedisa/biomedisa/).

TL;DR: 使用DDPM去噪扩散概率模型提升介入室FDCT图像质量，使其接近MDCT水平，减少患者移动需求


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 介入室FDCT图像质量较低且存在伪影，而使用FDCT单独成像可避免患者移动至MDCT室，提高诊疗效率

Method: 采用去噪扩散概率模型(DDPM)对FDCT扫描进行图像质量增强处理

Result: DDPM消除了大部分伪影，提高了解剖结构可见度，且不影响出血检测能力（前提是输入FDCT图像质量不过低）

Conclusion: DDPM能有效提升FDCT图像质量，使其在诊断价值上接近MDCT，为临床仅使用FDCT进行术前术后评估提供了可行性

Abstract: Patients undergoing a mechanical thrombectomy procedure usually have a
multi-detector CT (MDCT) scan before and after the intervention. The image
quality of the flat panel detector CT (FDCT) present in the intervention room
is generally much lower than that of a MDCT due to significant artifacts.
However, using only FDCT images could improve patient management as the patient
would not need to be moved to the MDCT room. Several studies have evaluated the
potential use of FDCT imaging alone and the time that could be saved by
acquiring the images before and/or after the intervention only with the FDCT.
This study proposes using a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to
improve the image quality of FDCT scans, making them comparable to MDCT scans.
Clinicans evaluated FDCT, MDCT, and our model's predictions for diagnostic
purposes using a questionnaire. The DDPM eliminated most artifacts and improved
anatomical visibility without reducing bleeding detection, provided that the
input FDCT image quality is not too low. Our code can be found on github.

TL;DR: 本文探索在神经超分辨率渲染中使用小波空间特征分解，通过小波域表示分离低高频细节，在保持结构一致性的同时更好地保留细腻纹理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RGB空间回归在保留细腻纹理方面有限，需要一种更有效的方法来提升神经超分辨率的感知质量。

Method: 基于DFASR框架，引入小波域表示，使用稳态小波变换(SWT)避免空间下采样，模型预测条件于空间G缓冲区和时间扭曲历史帧的小波系数，然后通过逆小波合成重组。

Result: 经过完整的剪除研究，结果显示采用SWT可以将PSNR提高至1.5dB，平均降低LPIPS 17%，计算开销仅增加24ms。虽然绝对运行时间较高，但在高端GPU上仍可以实现实时能力。

Conclusion: 小波域表示是一种有理论基础且高效的方法，能够显著提升图形应用中神经缩放的感知质量。

Abstract: We investigate the use of wavelet-space feature decomposition in neural
super-resolution for rendering pipelines. Building on the DFASR framework, we
introduce a wavelet-domain representation that separates low- and
high-frequency details before reconstruction, enabling the network to better
preserve fine textures while maintaining structural consistency. Unlike
RGB-space regression, our approach leverages the stationary wavelet transform
(SWT) to avoid spatial down-sampling, ensuring alignment across subbands and
preserving shift invariance. The model predicts wavelet coefficients
conditioned on spatial G-buffers and temporally warped history frames, which
are then recombined through inverse wavelet synthesis. We conduct a
comprehensive ablation study across wavelet families, transform types, and
architectural variants, showing that incorporating SWT improves PSNR by up to
1.5 dB and reduces LPIPS by 17% on average, at a computational overhead of
roughly +24 ms compared to out DFASR baseline. While absolute runtimes on our
RTX 3050 mobile GPU are higher ( 141ms) than the original DFASR report on RTX
4090( 11ms), the relative overhead remains modest, suggesting that on
higher-end GPUs our method would also remain real-time capable. Taken together,
our results suggest that wavelet-domain representations are a principled and
effective way to enhance perceptual quality in neural upscaling for graphics
applications.

Abstract: Creating immersive 3D visual experiences typically requires expensive and
specialized hardware such as VR headsets, autostereoscopic displays, or active

3D visualization technologies in resource-constrained settings. To address
this, we propose a low-cost system that enables real-time 3D light-field
viewing using only a standard 2D monitor, a conventional RGB webcam, and
red-cyan anaglyph glasses. The system integrates real-time eye-tracking to
dynamically adapt the displayed light-field image to the user's head position
with a lightweight rendering pipeline that selects and composites stereoscopic
views from pre-captured light-field data. The resulting anaglyph image is
updated in real-time, creating a more immersive and responsive 3D experience.
The system operates entirely on CPU and maintains a stable frame rate of 30
FPS, confirming its feasibility on typical consumer-grade hardware. All of
these highlight the potential of our approach as an accessible platform for
interactive 3D applications in education, digital media, and beyond.

Abstract: Micromobility systems, which include lightweight and low-speed vehicles such
as bicycles, e-bikes, and e-scooters, have become an important part of urban
transportation and are used to solve problems such as traffic congestion, air
pollution, and high transportation costs. Successful utilisation of
micromobilities requires optimisation of complex systems for efficiency,
environmental impact mitigation, and overcoming technical challenges for user
safety. Machine Learning (ML) methods have been crucial to support these
advancements and to address their unique challenges. However, there is
insufficient literature addressing the specific issues of ML applications in

comprehensive review of datasets, ML techniques, and their specific
applications in micromobilities. Specifically, we collect and analyse various
micromobility-related datasets and discuss them in terms of spatial, temporal,

of ML models applied in micromobilities, introducing their advantages,
challenges, and specific use cases. Furthermore, we explore multiple ML

Result: 在形状分类、重建和轮廓回归等任务中证明了RotaTouille的有效性。

Conclusion: RotaTouille框架成功实现了对轮廓数据的旋转和循环平移等变性，为处理此类数据提供了有效的深度学习解决方案。

Abstract: Contours or closed planar curves are common in many domains. For example,
they appear as object boundaries in computer vision, isolines in meteorology,
and the orbits of rotating machinery. In many cases when learning from contour
data, planar rotations of the input will result in correspondingly rotated
outputs. It is therefore desirable that deep learning models be rotationally
equivariant. In addition, contours are typically represented as an ordered
sequence of edge points, where the choice of starting point is arbitrary. It is
therefore also desirable for deep learning methods to be equivariant under
cyclic shifts. We present RotaTouille, a deep learning framework for learning
from contour data that achieves both rotation and cyclic shift equivariance
through complex-valued circular convolution. We further introduce and
characterize equivariant non-linearities, coarsening layers, and global pooling
layers to obtain invariant representations for downstream tasks. Finally, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of RotaTouille through experiments in shape
classification, reconstruction, and contour regression.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) exhibit remarkable generalization but require
adaptation to downstream tasks, particularly in privacy-sensitive applications.
Due to data privacy regulations, cloud-based FMs cannot directly access private
edge data, limiting their adaptation. Federated learning (FL) provides a
privacy-aware alternative, but existing FL approaches overlook the constraints
imposed by edge devices -- namely, limited computational resources and the
scarcity of labeled data. To address these challenges, we introduce Practical
Semi-Supervised Federated Learning (PSSFL), where edge devices hold only
unlabeled, low-resolution data, while the server has limited labeled,
high-resolution data. In this setting, we propose the Federated Mixture of
Experts (FedMox), a novel framework that enhances FM adaptation in FL. FedMox
tackles computational and resolution mismatch challenges via a sparse
Mixture-of-Experts architecture, employing a spatial router to align features
across resolutions and a Soft-Mixture strategy to stabilize semi-supervised
learning. We take object detection as a case study, and experiments on
real-world autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that FedMox effectively
adapts FMs under PSSFL, significantly improving performance with constrained
memory costs on edge devices. Our work paves the way for scalable and
privacy-preserving FM adaptation in federated scenarios.

Motivation: 传统6D姿态估计依赖CAD模型，但获取成本高且不实用。现有方法要么需要额外训练，要么产生幻觉几何。需要开发无需模型、零样本的高精度姿态估计方法。

Method: 从单视图RGB-D图像开始，使用多视图扩散模型估计初始3D高斯泼溅模型和不确定性。随着新观测加入，基于不确定性指导增量优化3D模型，并通过位姿图优化确保全局一致性。

Result: 大量实验表明，UnPose在6D姿态估计精度和3D重建质量上显著优于现有方法，并在真实机器人操作任务中展示了实际应用价值。

Conclusion: UnPose成功实现了无需CAD模型的零样本6D姿态估计和重建，通过扩散模型的3D先验和不确定性指导的多视图融合，为机器人视觉提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Estimating the 6D pose of novel objects is a fundamental yet challenging
problem in robotics, often relying on access to object CAD models. However,
acquiring such models can be costly and impractical. Recent approaches aim to
bypass this requirement by leveraging strong priors from foundation models to
reconstruct objects from single or multi-view images, but typically require
additional training or produce hallucinated geometry. To this end, we propose
UnPose, a novel framework for zero-shot, model-free 6D object pose estimation
and reconstruction that exploits 3D priors and uncertainty estimates from a
pre-trained diffusion model. Specifically, starting from a single-view RGB-D
frame, UnPose uses a multi-view diffusion model to estimate an initial 3D model
using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation, along with pixel-wise
epistemic uncertainty estimates. As additional observations become available,
we incrementally refine the 3DGS model by fusing new views guided by the
diffusion model's uncertainty, thereby continuously improving the pose
estimation accuracy and 3D reconstruction quality. To ensure global
consistency, the diffusion prior-generated views and subsequent observations
are further integrated in a pose graph and jointly optimized into a coherent
3DGS field. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UnPose significantly
outperforms existing approaches in both 6D pose estimation accuracy and 3D
reconstruction quality. We further showcase its practical applicability in
real-world robotic manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Accurately perceiving an object's pose and shape is essential for precise
grasping and manipulation. Compared to common vision-based methods, tactile
sensing offers advantages in precision and immunity to occlusion when tracking
and reconstructing objects in contact. This makes it particularly valuable for
in-hand and other high-precision manipulation tasks. In this work, we present
GelSLAM, a real-time 3D SLAM system that relies solely on tactile sensing to
estimate object pose over long periods and reconstruct object shapes with high
fidelity. Unlike traditional point cloud-based approaches, GelSLAM uses
tactile-derived surface normals and curvatures for robust tracking and loop
closure. It can track object motion in real time with low error and minimal
drift, and reconstruct shapes with submillimeter accuracy, even for low-texture
objects such as wooden tools. GelSLAM extends tactile sensing beyond local
contact to enable global, long-horizon spatial perception, and we believe it
will serve as a foundation for many precise manipulation tasks involving
interaction with objects in hand. The video demo is available on our website:

which is measured with labels. However, existing KD approaches usually use the
teacher with its original distribution, neglecting the potential of incorrect
prediction. This may contradict the motivation of hard-label learning through
cross-entropy loss, which may lead to sub-optimal knowledge distillation on
certain samples. To address this issue, we propose a novel logit processing
scheme via a sorting mechanism. Specifically, our method has a two-fold goal:
(1) fixing the incorrect prediction of the teacher based on the labels and (2)
reordering the distribution in a natural way according to priority rank at
once. As an easy-to-use, plug-and-play pre-processing, our sort method can be
effectively applied to existing logit-based KD methods. Extensive experiments
on the CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method.

### [81] [Harmonious Color Pairings: Insights from Human Preference and Natural Hue Statistics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15777)
*Ortensia Forni,Alexandre Darmon,Michael Benzaquen*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 通过量化实验研究色彩搭配偏好，发现偏好高度依赖色相，平均偏好模式与自然景观色彩分布相一致


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统色彩和谐研究基于定性见解或有限数据集，缺乏明确共识，需要量化、数据驱动的方法来研究色彩搭配偏好

Method: 使用HSL色彩空间的受控色调调色板，让参与者评估13种不同色相的组合，构建偏好矩阵并定义每种颜色的可搭配指数

Result: 偏好强度高度依赖于色相，挖成了文献中普遍和谐规则的假设；平均后出现统计意义上的美学偏好模式，某些色相间隔被认为更和谐，这些模式与自然景观的色彩分布相一致

Conclusion: 研究提供了量化研究色彩和谐的框架，并指出人类色彩偏好与自然色彩结构存在统计对应关系，揭示了色彩和谐的感知和生态基础

Abstract: While color harmony has long been studied in art and design, a clear
consensus remains elusive, as most models are grounded in qualitative insights
or limited datasets. In this work, we present a quantitative, data-driven study
of color pairing preferences using controlled hue-based palettes in the HSL
color space. Participants evaluated combinations of thirteen distinct hues,
enabling us to construct a preference matrix and define a combinability index
for each color. Our results reveal that preferences are highly hue dependent,
challenging the assumption of universal harmony rules proposed in the
literature. Yet, when averaged over hues, statistically meaningful patterns of
aesthetic preference emerge, with certain hue separations perceived as more
harmonious. Strikingly, these patterns align with hue distributions found in
natural landscapes, pointing to a statistical correspondence between human
color preferences and the structure of color in nature. Together, these
findings offer a quantitative framework for studying color harmony and its
potential perceptual and ecological underpinnings.

TL;DR: 提出了首个孟加拉手语指令生成数据集BdSLIG，并设计了融合手语参数（SPI）的提示方法，提升视觉语言模型在资源匮乏手语任务上的零样本性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决孟加拉手语等资源匮乏手语在AI领域缺乏支持的问题，促进聋哑人士与非手语使用者之间的双向交流

Method: 创建BdSLIG数据集，提出Sign Parameter-Infused (SPI)提示方法，将手形、动作、方向等标准手语参数融入文本提示

Result: SPI提示方法比自由文本提示产生更结构化、可重现的指令，提升了视觉语言模型在长尾视觉概念上的零样本性能

Conclusion: 该工作促进了资源匮乏社区手语学习系统的包容性和发展，为其他低资源手语提供了可借鉴的方法

Abstract: Sign Language (SL) enables two-way communication for the deaf and
hard-of-hearing community, yet many sign languages remain under-resourced in
the AI space. Sign Language Instruction Generation (SLIG) produces step-by-step
textual instructions that enable non-SL users to imitate and learn SL gestures,
promoting two-way interaction. We introduce BdSLIG, the first Bengali SLIG
dataset, used to evaluate Vision Language Models (VLMs) (i) on under-resourced
SLIG tasks, and (ii) on long-tail visual concepts, as Bengali SL is unlikely to
appear in the VLM pre-training data. To enhance zero-shot performance, we
introduce Sign Parameter-Infused (SPI) prompting, which integrates standard SL
parameters, like hand shape, motion, and orientation, directly into the textual
prompts. Subsuming standard sign parameters into the prompt makes the
instructions more structured and reproducible than free-form natural text from
vanilla prompting. We envision that our work would promote inclusivity and
advancement in SL learning systems for the under-resourced communities.

TL;DR: ComTree是一个考虑可理解性的码率自适应算法生成框架，通过生成满足性能要求的决策树集合，并利用大语言模型评估开发者可理解性，最终选择最便于人类理解和增强的解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习算法的黑盒特性使开发者难以理解决策过程和针对特定应用场景进行优化，现有研究通过决策树转换提高了可解释性，但可解释性并不等同于开发者的主观可理解性。

Method: 首先生成满足性能要求的完整决策树集合，然后利用大语言模型评估这些决策树对开发者的可理解性，最终选择最便于人类理解和增强的解决方案。

Result: 实验结果表明，ComTree在保持竞争力的性能的同时显著提高了可理解性，显示出进一步发展的潜力。

Conclusion: ComTree框架成功解决了深度学习算法在视频流自适应中的可理解性问题，为开发者提供了更易理解和优化的解决方案，具有重要的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Over the past decade, adaptive video streaming technology has witnessed
significant advancements, particularly driven by the rapid evolution of deep
learning techniques. However, the black-box nature of deep learning algorithms
presents challenges for developers in understanding decision-making processes
and optimizing for specific application scenarios. Although existing research
has enhanced algorithm interpretability through decision tree conversion,
interpretability does not directly equate to developers' subjective
comprehensibility. To address this challenge, we introduce \texttt{ComTree},
the first bitrate adaptation algorithm generation framework that considers
comprehensibility. The framework initially generates the complete set of
decision trees that meet performance requirements, then leverages large
language models to evaluate these trees for developer comprehensibility,
ultimately selecting solutions that best facilitate human understanding and
enhancement. Experimental results demonstrate that \texttt{ComTree}
significantly improves comprehensibility while maintaining competitive
performance, showing potential for further advancement. The source code is
available at https://github.com/thu-media/ComTree.

TL;DR: LingXi是一个基于用户体验的大规模个性化自适应视频流系统，通过分析用户参与度和退出率来动态优化算法参数，在快手平台上实现了观看时间、码率和卡顿时间的显著改善。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于系统级QoS指标的优化方法在现代大规模流媒体系统中已接近性能极限，如何将用户级QoE与算法优化目标对齐仍是一个未解决的挑战。

Method: 使用退出率作为关键指标，基于生产环境日志分析QoS指标与退出率的相关性，开发个性化退出率预测器，通过蒙特卡洛采样和在线贝叶斯优化迭代确定最优参数。

Result: 在快手平台8%流量的大规模A/B测试中，LingXi实现了总观看时间增加0.15%、码率提升0.1%、所有用户卡顿时间减少1.3%，低带宽用户的卡顿时间更是减少了15%。

Conclusion: LingXi是首个基于用户级体验的大规模部署个性化自适应视频流系统，通过将用户体验指标与算法优化目标对齐，显著提升了流媒体服务质量。

Abstract: Traditional optimization methods based on system-wide Quality of Service
(QoS) metrics have approached their performance limitations in modern
large-scale streaming systems. However, aligning user-level Quality of
Experience~(QoE) with algorithmic optimization objectives remains an unresolved
challenge. Therefore, we propose \texttt{LingXi}, the first large-scale
deployed system for personalized adaptive video streaming based on user-level
experience. \texttt{LingXi} dynamically optimizes the objectives of adaptive
video streaming algorithms by analyzing user engagement. Utilizing exit rate as
a key metric, we investigate the correlation between QoS indicators and exit
rates based on production environment logs, subsequently developing a
personalized exit rate predictor. Through Monte Carlo sampling and online
Bayesian optimization, we iteratively determine optimal parameters. Large-scale
A/B testing utilizing 8\% of traffic on Kuaishou, one of the largest short
video platforms, demonstrates \texttt{LingXi}'s superior performance.
\texttt{LingXi} achieves a 0.15\% increase in total viewing time, a 0.1\%
improvement in bitrate, and a 1.3\% reduction in stall time across all users,
with particularly significant improvements for low-bandwidth users who
experience a 15\% reduction in stall time.

TL;DR: 基于深度学习的虚拟多重免疫组化技术，通过无标记组织切片的自发荧光图像，同时生成ERG、PanCK和H&E虚拟染色，用于甲状腺癌血管侵犯的准确检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统免疫组化技术需要多个组织切片、存在切片间变异性、成本高且操作繁琐。多重免疫组化技术虽然能在单张切片上同时染色多种抗体，但操作更复杂且未在常规病理实验室普及。

Method: 开发深度学习框架，利用无标记组织切片的自发荧光显微镜图像，虚拟生成ERG、PanCK和H&E染色图像，实现血管侵犯的精确定位和解释。

Result: 虚拟多重免疫组化染色与化学染色结果高度一致，经认证病理学家盲评证实能准确突出上皮细胞和内皮细胞。在同一组织切片上成功识别和定位小血管侵犯。

Conclusion: 这种多重虚拟免疫组化方法可显著提高血管侵犯组织病理学评估的诊断准确性和效率，可能消除传统染色方案的需求，并缓解组织丢失和异质性相关问题。

Abstract: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) has transformed clinical pathology by enabling the
visualization of specific proteins within tissue sections. However, traditional
IHC requires one tissue section per stain, exhibits section-to-section
variability, and incurs high costs and laborious staining procedures. While
multiplexed IHC (mIHC) techniques enable simultaneous staining with multiple
antibodies on a single slide, they are more tedious to perform and are
currently unavailable in routine pathology laboratories. Here, we present a
deep learning-based virtual multiplexed immunostaining framework to
simultaneously generate ERG and PanCK, in addition to H&E virtual staining,
enabling accurate localization and interpretation of vascular invasion in
thyroid cancers. This virtual mIHC technique is based on the autofluorescence
microscopy images of label-free tissue sections, and its output images closely
match the histochemical staining counterparts (ERG, PanCK and H&E) of the same
tissue sections. Blind evaluation by board-certified pathologists demonstrated
that virtual mIHC staining achieved high concordance with the histochemical
staining results, accurately highlighting epithelial cells and endothelial
cells. Virtual mIHC conducted on the same tissue section also allowed the
identification and localization of small vessel invasion. This multiplexed
virtual IHC approach can significantly improve diagnostic accuracy and
efficiency in the histopathological evaluation of vascular invasion,
potentially eliminating the need for traditional staining protocols and
mitigating issues related to tissue loss and heterogeneity.

TL;DR: MoDER方法通过模块化框架训练多个文本专家，在推理时组合专家来合成改进的原型，增强视觉语言模型的零样本能力，在14个数据集上验证有效


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有持续学习方法主要关注保持视觉语言模型的零样本能力，本文旨在将这种保持转变为增强，当下游任务与预训练领域差异较大时，微调仍然必要

Method: 提出MoDular Embedding Recomposition (MoDER)方法，训练多个文本专家（每个专家专注于一个已见类别），存储在基础中心中。推理时对未见类别查询中心并组合检索到的专家来合成改进的分类原型

Result: 在两个流行的零样本增量协议（Class-IL和MTIL）上验证有效性，涵盖总共14个数据集

Conclusion: MoDER方法成功地将零样本能力的保持转变为增强，通过模块化专家组合的方式提升了视觉语言模型在持续学习中的性能

Abstract: The advent of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has significantly
transformed Continual Learning (CL), mainly due to their zero-shot
classification abilities. Such proficiency makes VLMs well-suited for
real-world applications, enabling robust performance on novel unseen classes
without requiring adaptation. However, fine-tuning remains essential when
downstream tasks deviate significantly from the pre-training domain. Prior CL
approaches primarily focus on preserving the zero-shot capabilities of VLMs
during incremental fine-tuning on a downstream task. We take a step further by
devising an approach that transforms preservation into enhancement of the
zero-shot capabilities of VLMs. Our approach, named MoDular Embedding
Recomposition (MoDER), introduces a modular framework that trains multiple
textual experts, each specialized in a single seen class, and stores them in a
foundational hub. At inference time, for each unseen class, we query the hub
and compose the retrieved experts to synthesize a refined prototype that
improves classification. We show the effectiveness of our method across two
popular zero-shot incremental protocols, Class-IL and MTIL, comprising a total
of 14 datasets. The codebase is available at

Result: 在ABCD青少年队列中，NeuroKoop优于相关基线方法，揭示了显著的结构-功能连接，提高了产前药物暴露状态的分类性能

Conclusion: NeuroKoop框架通过融合多模态脑网络数据，增强了对产前药物暴露神经发育影响的理解，提供了更稳健的分类和生物学洞察

Abstract: Understanding how prenatal exposure to psychoactive substances such as
cannabis shapes adolescent brain organization remains a critical challenge,
complicated by the complexity of multimodal neuroimaging data and the
limitations of conventional analytic methods. Existing approaches often fail to
fully capture the complementary features embedded within structural and
functional connectomes, constraining both biological insight and predictive
performance. To address this, we introduced NeuroKoop, a novel graph neural
network-based framework that integrates structural and functional brain
networks utilizing neural Koopman operator-driven latent space fusion. By
leveraging Koopman theory, NeuroKoop unifies node embeddings derived from
source-based morphometry (SBM) and functional network connectivity (FNC) based
brain graphs, resulting in enhanced representation learning and more robust
classification of prenatal drug exposure (PDE) status. Applied to a large
adolescent cohort from the ABCD dataset, NeuroKoop outperformed relevant
baselines and revealed salient structural-functional connections, advancing our
understanding of the neurodevelopmental impact of PDE.

TL;DR: 论文提出了PediatricsMQA基准测试，揭示LLM和VLM在儿科医学任务中存在显著年龄偏见，性能随患者年龄降低而下降，需要开发年龄感知方法来确保AI在儿科护理中的公平性。


<details>

Motivation: 大型语言模型和视觉增强语言模型在医疗信息学中表现出系统性年龄偏见，特别是在儿科任务上性能较差，这反映了医学研究中儿科研究资金和代表性不足的问题。

Method: 开发了多模态儿科问答基准PediatricsMQA，包含3,417个文本多选题和2,067个视觉多选题，覆盖131个儿科主题和7个发育阶段，采用混合手动-自动流水线构建。

Result: 评估最先进的开源模型发现，在年轻群体中性能显著下降，凸显了年龄偏见问题的严重性。

Conclusion: 需要开发年龄感知方法来确保AI在儿科护理中的公平性和可靠性，以解决现有模型在儿科医疗任务中的系统性偏见问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and vision-augmented LLMs (VLMs) have
significantly advanced medical informatics, diagnostics, and decision support.
However, these models exhibit systematic biases, particularly age bias,
compromising their reliability and equity. This is evident in their poorer
performance on pediatric-focused text and visual question-answering tasks. This
bias reflects a broader imbalance in medical research, where pediatric studies
receive less funding and representation despite the significant disease burden
in children. To address these issues, a new comprehensive multi-modal pediatric
question-answering benchmark, PediatricsMQA, has been introduced. It consists
of 3,417 text-based multiple-choice questions (MCQs) covering 131 pediatric
topics across seven developmental stages (prenatal to adolescent) and 2,067
vision-based MCQs using 634 pediatric images from 67 imaging modalities and 256
anatomical regions. The dataset was developed using a hybrid manual-automatic
pipeline, incorporating peer-reviewed pediatric literature, validated question
banks, existing benchmarks, and existing QA resources. Evaluating
state-of-the-art open models, we find dramatic performance drops in younger
cohorts, highlighting the need for age-aware methods to ensure equitable AI
support in pediatric care.
