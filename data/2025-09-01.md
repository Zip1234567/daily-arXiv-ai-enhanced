Abstract: As the computer vision community advances autonomous driving algorithms,
integrating vision-based insights with sensor data remains essential for
improving perception, decision making, planning, prediction, simulation, and
control. Yet we must ask: Why don't we have entirely safe self-driving cars
yet? A key part of the answer lies in addressing novel scenarios, one of the
most critical barriers to real-world deployment. Our 2COOOL workshop provides a
dedicated forum for researchers and industry experts to push the state of the
art in novelty handling, including out-of-distribution hazard detection,
vision-language models for hazard understanding, new benchmarking and
methodologies, and safe autonomous driving practices. The 2nd Workshop on the
Challenge of Out-of-Label Hazards in Autonomous Driving (2COOOL) will be held
at the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 2025 in Honolulu,
Hawaii, on October 19, 2025. We aim to inspire the development of new
algorithms and systems for hazard avoidance, drawing on ideas from anomaly
detection, open-set recognition, open-vocabulary modeling, domain adaptation,
and related fields. Building on the success of its inaugural edition at the
Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV) 2025, the workshop
will feature a mix of academic and industry participation.

### [2] [Advanced Deep Learning Techniques for Classifying Dental Conditions Using Panoramic X-Ray Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21088)
*Alireza Golkarieh,Kiana Kiashemshaki,Sajjad Rezvani Boroujeni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估了三种深度学习方法对全景X射线图像中四种牙科状况的自动分类，发现CNN与随机森林的混合模型效果最佳，准确率达85.4%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发自动化牙科诊断支持系统，提高牙科X光图像分析的准确性和效率，减轻专家工作负担

Method: 使用1,512张全景X射线图像数据集，评估三种方法：自定义CNN、CNN特征提取+传统分类器的混合模型、微调预训练架构，采用5折交叉验证

Result: 混合CNN-随机森林模型表现最佳（85.4%准确率），优于自定义CNN基线（74.3%）；预训练模型中VGG16表现最好（82.3%准确率）

Conclusion: CNN特征提取与集成分类器结合是自动化牙科诊断支持的实用路径，但需要更大数据集和进一步临床验证

Abstract: This study investigates deep learning methods for automated classification of
dental conditions in panoramic X-ray images. A dataset of 1,512 radiographs
with 11,137 expert-verified annotations across four conditions fillings,
cavities, implants, and impacted teeth was used. After preprocessing and class
balancing, three approaches were evaluated: a custom convolutional neural
network (CNN), hybrid models combining CNN feature extraction with traditional
classifiers, and fine-tuned pre-trained architectures. Experiments employed 5
fold cross validation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score as
evaluation metrics. The hybrid CNN Random Forest model achieved the highest
performance with 85.4% accuracy, surpassing the custom CNN baseline of 74.3%.
Among pre-trained models, VGG16 performed best at 82.3% accuracy, followed by
Xception and ResNet50. Results show that hybrid models improve discrimination
of morphologically similar conditions and provide efficient, reliable
performance. These findings suggest that combining CNN-based feature extraction
with ensemble classifiers offers a practical path toward automated dental
diagnostic support, while also highlighting the need for larger datasets and
further clinical validation.

### [3] [Q-Align: Alleviating Attention Leakage in Zero-Shot Appearance Transfer via Query-Query Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21090)
*Namu Kim,Wonbin Kweon,Minsoo Kim,Hwanjo Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Q-Align通过Query-Query对齐解决注意力泄漏问题，在零样本外观迁移中实现了更好的语义对齐和外观保真度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模图像生成模型在零样本外观迁移中存在注意力泄漏问题，这是由于Query-Key对齐导致的语义映射挑战

Method: 提出Q-Align方法，包含三个核心贡献：1) Query-Query对齐实现精细空间语义映射；2) Key-Value重排增强特征对应；3) 使用重排后的键值进行注意力精化保持语义一致性

Result: 通过大量实验验证，Q-Align在外观保真度方面优于最先进方法，同时保持竞争力的结构保持能力

Conclusion: Q-Align有效解决了注意力泄漏问题，为零样本外观迁移提供了更好的语义对齐解决方案

Abstract: We observe that zero-shot appearance transfer with large-scale image
generation models faces a significant challenge: Attention Leakage. This
challenge arises when the semantic mapping between two images is captured by
the Query-Key alignment. To tackle this issue, we introduce Q-Align, utilizing
Query-Query alignment to mitigate attention leakage and improve the semantic
alignment in zero-shot appearance transfer. Q-Align incorporates three core
contributions: (1) Query-Query alignment, facilitating the sophisticated
spatial semantic mapping between two images; (2) Key-Value rearrangement,
enhancing feature correspondence through realignment; and (3) Attention
refinement using rearranged keys and values to maintain semantic consistency.
We validate the effectiveness of Q-Align through extensive experiments and
analysis, and Q-Align outperforms state-of-the-art methods in appearance
fidelity while maintaining competitive structure preservation.

### [4] [ERTACache: Error Rectification and Timesteps Adjustment for Efficient Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21091)
*Xurui Peng,Hong Liu,Chenqian Yan,Rui Ma,Fangmin Chen,Xing Wang,Zhihua Wu,Songwei Liu,Mingbao Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ERTACache是一个针对扩散模型的缓存加速框架，通过分析缓存误差的两个主要来源（特征偏移误差和步长放大误差），采用离线残差分析、轨迹感知校正和残差线性化模型，实现2倍推理加速同时保持甚至提升视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型由于迭代推理过程导致计算开销巨大，虽然特征缓存可以加速，但简单的重用会导致明显的质量下降。需要解决缓存引入的累积误差问题。

Method: 提出ERTACache框架：1）离线残差分析识别可重用步骤；2）通过轨迹感知校正系数动态调整积分间隔；3）使用闭式残差线性化模型近似缓存误差。联合校正特征偏移误差和步长放大误差。

Result: 在标准图像和视频生成基准测试中，ERTACache实现高达2倍推理加速，同时保持甚至改善视觉质量。在Wan2.1视频扩散模型上，2倍加速下VBench指标退化最小，有效保持基准保真度。

Conclusion: ERTACache提供了一个原则性的缓存框架，能够在激进缓存重用下实现准确高效的采样，显著提升扩散模型推理效率而不牺牲质量。

Abstract: Diffusion models suffer from substantial computational overhead due to their
inherently iterative inference process. While feature caching offers a
promising acceleration strategy by reusing intermediate outputs across
timesteps, naive reuse often incurs noticeable quality degradation. In this
work, we formally analyze the cumulative error introduced by caching and
decompose it into two principal components: feature shift error, caused by
inaccuracies in cached outputs, and step amplification error, which arises from
error propagation under fixed timestep schedules. To address these issues, we
propose ERTACache, a principled caching framework that jointly rectifies both
error types. Our method employs an offline residual profiling stage to identify
reusable steps, dynamically adjusts integration intervals via a
trajectory-aware correction coefficient, and analytically approximates
cache-induced errors through a closed-form residual linearization model.
Together, these components enable accurate and efficient sampling under
aggressive cache reuse. Extensive experiments across standard image and video
generation benchmarks show that ERTACache achieves up to 2x inference speedup
while consistently preserving or even improving visual quality. Notably, on the
state-of-the-art Wan2.1 video diffusion model, ERTACache delivers 2x
acceleration with minimal VBench degradation, effectively maintaining baseline
fidelity while significantly improving efficiency. The code is available at
https://github.com/bytedance/ERTACache.

### [5] [Video-LLMs with Temporal Visual Screening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21094)
*Zheyu Fan,Jiateng Liu,Yuji Zhang,Zihan Wang,Yi R.,Fung,Manling Li,Heng Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了时间视觉筛选(TVS)方法，通过保留关键视频段落和重构查询来改善视频大语言模型的时间语义理解能力，在训练和推理阶段都取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频大语言模型因为帧采样稀疏和帧间推理监督不充而无法抓取细粒度的时间语义，需要一种方法来模仿人类的时间筛选行为。

Method: 提出TVS方法：(1)保留重点关键视频段落，(2)同步重构查询保持答案一致性，(3)保持答案的不变性。这是一个模块化的前端适配器任务，可集成到视频指令循环和问答管道中。

Result: 实验结果显示TVS在训练阶段获得7.33%的相对提升，在推理阶段获得34.6%的相对提升。ReSimplifyIt基线模型在视频剪辑任务上比之前方法提高了0.47的F-1分数。

Conclusion: TVS通过时间信息筛选有效改善了视频-语言理解能力，优化了计算负荷分布，在训练和推理阶段都取得了显著成效。

Abstract: Humans naturally perform temporal screening by dragging the progress bar and
focusing on salient temporal segments, but current Video Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs) struggle to capture fine-grained temporal semantics due to sparse
frame sampling and insufficient inter-frame reasoning supervision during their
training. To address this, Inspired by well-established cognitive science
principles, we propose Temporal Visual Screening (TVS), a new task that
universally pre-processes video question answering and instruction tuning data
by: (1) retaining focus-critical video segments, (2) synchronously
reconstructing queries to their most direct form while preserving answer
consistency, and (3) keeping the invariance and consistency for any possible
answer. TVS is formulated as a modular front-end adapter task that can be
seamlessly integrated into both Video Instruction Tuning (training) and Video
Question Answering (inference) pipelines. TVS optimizes distribution of
reasoning burden and cognitive load; during training, it aligns queries with
focus-critical visual information; at inference, it enables query-aware segment
focus and streamlined query representations. In particular, we curate the first
benchmark for TVS and propose ReSimplifyIt, a baseline outperforming prior
approaches on seemingly similar tasks by 0.47 in F-1 score on video trimming
while achieving competitive query rewriting performance. Experiments
demonstrate that incorporating TVS yields relative gains of 7.33% (training)
and 34.6% (inference), demonstrating the effectiveness of temporal information
screening for improving video-language understanding.

### [6] [ROBUST-MIPS: A Combined Skeletal Pose and Instance Segmentation Dataset for Laparoscopic Surgical Instruments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21096)
*Zhe Han,Charlie Budd,Gongyu Zhang,Huanyu Tian,Christos Bergeles,Tom Vercauteren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了ROBUST-MIPS数据集，将手术工具的姿态标注作为比分割标注更高效的标注方式，并通过基准测试验证了姿态标注在手术工具定位中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于深度学习的手术工具定位方法依赖于分割标注，但这类标注数据稀缺且标注成本高。作者认为姿态标注在语义信息丰富度和标注效率之间取得了更好平衡，能够加速标注数据的增长。

Method: 基于现有的ROBUST-MIS数据集，创建了ROBUST-MIPS数据集，包含工具姿态和实例分割两种标注。使用流行的姿态估计方法建立简单基准，评估姿态标注的有效性。

Result: 实验观察到高质量的姿态估计结果，证明了姿态标注对于手术工具定位的充分性。

Conclusion: 姿态标注是手术工具定位的一种高效标注方式，新发布的ROBUST-MIPS数据集和配套软件将促进该标注方式的采用和相关研究的发展。

Abstract: Localisation of surgical tools constitutes a foundational building block for
computer-assisted interventional technologies. Works in this field typically
focus on training deep learning models to perform segmentation tasks.
Performance of learning-based approaches is limited by the availability of
diverse annotated data. We argue that skeletal pose annotations are a more
efficient annotation approach for surgical tools, striking a balance between
richness of semantic information and ease of annotation, thus allowing for
accelerated growth of available annotated data. To encourage adoption of this
annotation style, we present, ROBUST-MIPS, a combined tool pose and tool
instance segmentation dataset derived from the existing ROBUST-MIS dataset. Our
enriched dataset facilitates the joint study of these two annotation styles and
allow head-to-head comparison on various downstream tasks. To demonstrate the
adequacy of pose annotations for surgical tool localisation, we set up a simple
benchmark using popular pose estimation methods and observe high-quality
results. To ease adoption, together with the dataset, we release our benchmark
models and custom tool pose annotation software.

### [7] [Entropy-Based Non-Invasive Reliability Monitoring of Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21715)
*Amirhossein Nazeri,Wael Hafez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过监测CNN激活向量的熵值变化，无需修改模型结构即可检测对抗性干扰，检测准确率达90%，偏差率低于20%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对抗性检测方法需要昂贵的重新训练、修改网络结构或影响清洁输入性能，需要一种无需修改原始模型的实用检测方法

Method: 采用并行熵值监测技术，在VGG-16模型的早期卷积层监测激活向量的熵值变化，对抗性干扰导致激活熵值产生7%的明显偏移

Result: 对抗性输入在早期卷积层导致激活熵值一致性偏移7%，实现90%检测准确率，偏差率和死律率均低于20%，清洁和对抗性输入的熵值分布完全分离

Conclusion: CNN模型在激活模式中本质地编码了数据分布偏移，通过激活熵值单独即可评估模型可靠性，实现了无需修改原始模型性能的实时对抗性输入检测

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the foundation of modern
computer vision, achieving unprecedented accuracy across diverse image
recognition tasks. While these networks excel on in-distribution data, they
remain vulnerable to adversarial perturbations imperceptible input
modifications that cause misclassification with high confidence. However,
existing detection methods either require expensive retraining, modify network
architecture, or degrade performance on clean inputs. Here we show that
adversarial perturbations create immediate, detectable entropy signatures in
CNN activations that can be monitored without any model modification. Using
parallel entropy monitoring on VGG-16, we demonstrate that adversarial inputs
consistently shift activation entropy by 7% in early convolutional layers,
enabling 90% detection accuracy with false positives and false negative rates
below 20%. The complete separation between clean and adversarial entropy
distributions reveals that CNNs inherently encode distribution shifts in their
activation patterns. This work establishes that CNN reliability can be assessed
through activation entropy alone, enabling practical deployment of
self-diagnostic vision systems that detect adversarial inputs in real-time
without compromising original model performance.

### [8] [Safe-Control: A Safety Patch for Mitigating Unsafe Content in Text-to-Image Generation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21099)
*Xiangtao Meng,Yingkai Dong,Ning Yu,Li Wang,Zheng Li,Shanqing Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Safe-Control是一个即插即用的安全补丁，通过数据驱动策略和安全感知条件，在锁定T2I模型中注入安全控制信号，有效减少不安全内容生成，同时保持良性图像质量和文本对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的T2I模型安全机制在分布偏移下容易被规避，或者需要大量模型特定调整，存在局限性。

Method: 使用数据驱动策略和安全感知条件，以补丁方式向锁定的T2I模型注入安全控制信号，支持构建多种安全补丁并灵活合并。

Result: 在6个不同T2I模型上评估显示，Safe-Control将不安全内容生成概率降至7%，显著优于其他7种最先进安全机制（约20%），同时保持良性图像质量和文本对齐。

Conclusion: Safe-Control是一种有效的即插即用安全解决方案，能够显著减少T2I模型的不安全内容生成，具有良好的适应性和兼容性。

Abstract: Despite the advancements in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models, their
potential for misuse or even abuse raises serious safety concerns. Model
developers have made tremendous efforts to introduce safety mechanisms that can
address these concerns in T2I models. However, the existing safety mechanisms,
whether external or internal, either remain susceptible to evasion under
distribution shifts or require extensive model-specific adjustments. To address
these limitations, we introduce Safe-Control, an innovative plug-and-play
safety patch designed to mitigate unsafe content generation in T2I models.
Using data-driven strategies and safety-aware conditions, Safe-Control injects
safety control signals into the locked T2I model, acting as an update in a
patch-like manner. Model developers can also construct various safety patches
to meet the evolving safety requirements, which can be flexibly merged into a
single, unified patch. Its plug-and-play design further ensures adaptability,
making it compatible with other T2I models of similar denoising architecture.
We conduct extensive evaluations on six diverse and public T2I models.
Empirical results highlight that Safe-Control is effective in reducing unsafe
content generation across six diverse T2I models with similar generative
architectures, yet it successfully maintains the quality and text alignment of
benign images. Compared to seven state-of-the-art safety mechanisms, including
both external and internal defenses, Safe-Control significantly outperforms all
baselines in reducing unsafe content generation. For example, it reduces the
probability of unsafe content generation to 7%, compared to approximately 20%
for most baseline methods, under both unsafe prompts and the latest adversarial
attacks.

### [9] [GENNAV: Polygon Mask Generation for Generalized Referring Navigable Regions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21102)
*Kei Katsumata,Yui Iioka,Naoki Hosomi,Teruhisa Misu,Kentaro Yamada,Komei Sugiura*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GENNAV是一个用于从自然语言指令和前置摄像头图像中识别目标区域位置的新方法，特别擅长处理边界模糊的stuff-type目标区域，并在多目标和无目标情况下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理stuff-type目标区域（边界模糊）以及无目标或多目标情况时表现不佳，需要一种能够同时预测目标存在性和生成分割掩码的解决方案。

Method: 提出GENNAV方法，能够预测目标存在性并为多个stuff-type目标区域生成分割掩码。构建了GRiN-Drive基准数据集，包含无目标、单目标和多目标三种样本类型。

Result: GENNAV在标准评估指标上优于基线方法。在四个汽车、五个不同地理区域的真实世界实验中，展示了零样本迁移性能的优越性和跨环境鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GENNAV在目标区域定位任务中表现出色，特别是在处理stuff-type目标、多目标和无目标场景方面具有显著优势，并在真实世界环境中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: We focus on the task of identifying the location of target regions from a
natural language instruction and a front camera image captured by a mobility.
This task is challenging because it requires both existence prediction and
segmentation, particularly for stuff-type target regions with ambiguous
boundaries. Existing methods often underperform in handling stuff-type target
regions, in addition to absent or multiple targets. To overcome these
limitations, we propose GENNAV, which predicts target existence and generates
segmentation masks for multiple stuff-type target regions. To evaluate GENNAV,
we constructed a novel benchmark called GRiN-Drive, which includes three
distinct types of samples: no-target, single-target, and multi-target. GENNAV
achieved superior performance over baseline methods on standard evaluation
metrics. Furthermore, we conducted real-world experiments with four automobiles
operated in five geographically distinct urban areas to validate its zero-shot
transfer performance. In these experiments, GENNAV outperformed baseline
methods and demonstrated its robustness across diverse real-world environments.

### [10] [R-4B: Incentivizing General-Purpose Auto-Thinking Capability in MLLMs via Bi-Mode Annealing and Reinforce Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21113)
*Jie Jiang,Qi Yang,Bolin Ni,Shiming Xiang,Han Hu,Houwen Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: R-4B是一个自适应思考的多模态大语言模型，能够根据问题复杂度自动决定是否需要思考过程，在保持高性能的同时降低计算成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在处理简单问题时也会进行冗余的逐步思考过程，导致计算效率低下，需要一种能够自适应决定是否思考的模型

Method: 采用双模式退火训练和双模式策略优化(BPO)，首先在精心策划的数据集上训练模型，然后在改进的GRPO框架下进行第二阶段训练，强制模型为每个输入生成两种模式的响应

Result: 在25个具有挑战性的基准测试中达到最先进性能，在大多数任务中超越Qwen2.5-VL-7B，在推理密集型基准上与更大的16B模型性能相当但计算成本更低

Conclusion: R-4B通过自适应思考机制成功解决了多模态大语言模型在处理简单问题时的计算效率问题，实现了性能与效率的平衡

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) equipped with step-by-step thinking
capabilities have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning
problems. However, this thinking process is redundant for simple problems
solvable without complex reasoning. To address this inefficiency, we propose
R-4B, an auto-thinking MLLM, which can adaptively decide when to think based on
problem complexity. The central idea of R-4B is to empower the model with both
thinking and non-thinking capabilities using bi-mode annealing, and apply
Bi-mode Policy Optimization~(BPO) to improve the model's accuracy in
determining whether to activate the thinking process. Specifically, we first
train the model on a carefully curated dataset spanning various topics, which
contains samples from both thinking and non-thinking modes. Then it undergoes a
second phase of training under an improved GRPO framework, where the policy
model is forced to generate responses from both modes for each input query.
Experimental results show that R-4B achieves state-of-the-art performance
across 25 challenging benchmarks. It outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-7B in most tasks
and achieves performance comparable to larger models such as
Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506 (16B) on reasoning-intensive benchmarks with lower
computational cost.

*Harris Song,Tuan-Anh Vu,Sanjith Menon,Sriram Narasimhan,M. Khalid Jawed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiddenObject是一个基于Mamba的RGB、热成像和深度数据融合框架，用于在遮挡、伪装等复杂条件下检测隐藏或部分遮蔽的目标，在多个基准数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RGB检测方法在遮挡、伪装和光照变化等恶劣条件下性能受限，需要更鲁棒的模态无关方法来检测隐藏或部分遮蔽的目标。

Method: 提出基于Mamba的融合机制，整合RGB、热成像和深度数据，捕获跨模态的互补信号，识别模态特定特征并在统一表示中进行融合。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上验证，相比现有方法达到最先进或具有竞争力的性能，证明了融合设计的有效性。

Conclusion: 基于Mamba的融合架构能显著推进多模态目标检测领域发展，特别是在视觉退化或复杂条件下，暴露了当前单模态和简单融合策略的关键局限性。

Abstract: Detecting hidden or partially concealed objects remains a fundamental
challenge in multimodal environments, where factors like occlusion, camouflage,
and lighting variations significantly hinder performance. Traditional RGB-based
detection methods often fail under such adverse conditions, motivating the need
for more robust, modality-agnostic approaches. In this work, we present
HiddenObject, a fusion framework that integrates RGB, thermal, and depth data
using a Mamba-based fusion mechanism. Our method captures complementary signals
across modalities, enabling enhanced detection of obscured or camouflaged
targets. Specifically, the proposed approach identifies modality-specific
features and fuses them in a unified representation that generalizes well
across challenging scenarios. We validate HiddenObject across multiple
benchmark datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art or competitive performance
compared to existing methods. These results highlight the efficacy of our
fusion design and expose key limitations in current unimodal and na\"ive fusion
strategies. More broadly, our findings suggest that Mamba-based fusion
architectures can significantly advance the field of multimodal object
detection, especially under visually degraded or complex conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RadGS-Reg是一个新颖的框架，通过联合3D辐射高斯重建和3D/3D配准，实现椎体级别的CT/X-ray配准，在噪声X射线条件下表现出优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统"渲染比较"方法在CT/X-ray配准中的空间信息丢失和域差距问题，以及现有双平面X射线3D重建方法对密集视图要求和噪声处理的局限性。

Method: 提出RadGS-Reg框架，包含基于学习的辐射高斯重建模块和反事实注意力学习机制，采用患者特异性预训练策略从模拟数据逐步适应到真实数据。

Result: 在内部数据集上的实验显示，该方法在两个任务上都达到了最先进的性能，超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: RadGS-Reg框架有效解决了CT/X-ray配准中的关键挑战，为图像引导导航提供了高精度和实时性能的解决方案。

Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT)/X-ray registration in image-guided navigation
remains challenging because of its stringent requirements for high accuracy and
real-time performance. Traditional "render and compare" methods, relying on
iterative projection and comparison, suffer from spatial information loss and
domain gap. 3D reconstruction from biplanar X-rays supplements spatial and
shape information for 2D/3D registration, but current methods are limited by
dense-view requirements and struggles with noisy X-rays. To address these
limitations, we introduce RadGS-Reg, a novel framework for vertebral-level
CT/X-ray registration through joint 3D Radiative Gaussians (RadGS)
reconstruction and 3D/3D registration. Specifically, our biplanar X-rays
vertebral RadGS reconstruction module explores learning-based RadGS
reconstruction method with a Counterfactual Attention Learning (CAL) mechanism,
focusing on vertebral regions in noisy X-rays. Additionally, a patient-specific
pre-training strategy progressively adapts the RadGS-Reg from simulated to real
data while simultaneously learning vertebral shape prior knowledge. Experiments
on in-house datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance for both
tasks, surpassing existing methods. The code is available at:

Abstract: 3D building models are critical for applications in architecture, energy
simulation, and navigation. Yet, generating accurate and semantically rich 3D
buildings automatically remains a major challenge due to the lack of
large-scale annotated datasets in the public domain. Inspired by the success of
synthetic data in computer vision, we introduce SYNBUILD-3D, a large, diverse,
and multi-modal dataset of over 6.2 million synthetic 3D residential buildings
at Level of Detail (LoD) 4. In the dataset, each building is represented
through three distinct modalities: a semantically enriched 3D wireframe graph
at LoD 4 (Modality I), the corresponding floor plan images (Modality II), and a

*Mårten Wadenbäck,Marcus Valtonen Örnhag,Johan Edstedt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一的方法来同时估计单应性变换和径向畸变，解决了三种不同的畸变配置情况，并开发了快速、稳定、准确的最小求解器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在计算机视觉中，单应性估计是许多任务的关键步骤，但相机镜头引起的几何畸变（特别是径向畸变）会影响估计精度。现有方法分别处理不同的畸变配置，缺乏统一的解决方案。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的统一方法，能够同时处理三种径向畸变配置：（i）仅一幅图像有畸变，（ii）两幅图像有相同畸变，（iii）两幅图像有独立畸变。基于此方法构建了快速、稳定、准确的最小求解器。

Result: 在所有三种情况下，提出的求解器都比现有最先进方法更快，同时保持相似的精度。在包括鱼眼相机图像在内的标准基准测试中表现良好。

Conclusion: 该方法为径向畸变单应性估计提供了一个统一的框架，所开发的求解器在速度和准确性方面都优于现有方法，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Homographies are among the most prevalent transformations occurring in
geometric computer vision and projective geometry, and homography estimation is
consequently a crucial step in a wide assortment of computer vision tasks. When
working with real images, which are often afflicted with geometric distortions
caused by the camera lens, it may be necessary to determine both the homography
and the lens distortion-particularly the radial component, called radial
distortion-simultaneously to obtain anything resembling useful estimates. When
considering a homography with radial distortion between two images, there are
three conceptually distinct configurations for the radial distortion; (i)
distortion in only one image, (ii) identical distortion in the two images, and
(iii) independent distortion in the two images. While these cases have been
addressed separately in the past, the present paper provides a novel and
unified approach to solve all three cases. We demonstrate how the proposed
approach can be used to construct new fast, stable, and accurate minimal
solvers for radially distorted homographies. In all three cases, our proposed
solvers are faster than the existing state-of-the-art solvers while maintaining
similar accuracy. The solvers are tested on well-established benchmarks
including images taken with fisheye cameras. The source code for our solvers
will be made available in the event our paper is accepted for publication.

*Zhenghao He,Sanchit Sinha,Guangzhi Xiong,Aidong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了全局概念激活向量（GCAV）框架，通过对比学习和注意力融合机制统一不同层的CAV表示，解决了跨层概念不一致性问题，提高了概念归因的稳定性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的概念激活向量（CAVs）在不同层独立计算时存在不一致性，导致跨层比较不可靠，需要一种统一的方法来确保概念表示的语义一致性。

Method: 使用对比学习对齐跨层概念表示，并采用基于注意力的融合机制构建全局集成的GCAV，同时提出了TGCAV方法来评估GCAV表示的效果。

Result: 实验表明GCAV显著降低了TCAV分数的方差，保持了概念相关性，有效缓解了跨层概念不一致性，增强了概念定位能力，并提高了对抗扰动的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GCAV通过整合跨层信息提供了一个更全面、可解释的框架，帮助理解深度学习模型如何编码人类定义的概念，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) provide a powerful approach for
interpreting deep neural networks by quantifying their sensitivity to
human-defined concepts. However, when computed independently at different
layers, CAVs often exhibit inconsistencies, making cross-layer comparisons
unreliable. To address this issue, we propose the Global Concept Activation
Vector (GCAV), a novel framework that unifies CAVs into a single, semantically
consistent representation. Our method leverages contrastive learning to align
concept representations across layers and employs an attention-based fusion
mechanism to construct a globally integrated CAV. By doing so, our method
significantly reduces the variance in TCAV scores while preserving concept
relevance, ensuring more stable and reliable concept attributions. To evaluate
the effectiveness of GCAV, we introduce Testing with Global Concept Activation
Vectors (TGCAV) as a method to apply TCAV to GCAV-based representations. We
conduct extensive experiments on multiple deep neural networks, demonstrating
that our method effectively mitigates concept inconsistency across layers,
enhances concept localization, and improves robustness against adversarial
perturbations. By integrating cross-layer information into a coherent
framework, our method offers a more comprehensive and interpretable
understanding of how deep learning models encode human-defined concepts. Code
and models are available at https://github.com/Zhenghao-He/GCAV.

### [16] [Generalizable Object Re-Identification via Visual In-Context Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21222)
*Zhizhong Huang,Xiaoming Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VICP是一个无需参数调整的视觉上下文提示框架，通过结合LLM和视觉基础模型，使模型能够直接从已见类别泛化到未见类别，仅需少量上下文示例作为提示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前ReID方法需要针对特定领域训练模型，缺乏泛化能力且需要大量标注数据。自监督学习虽然减少标注需求，但难以捕捉身份敏感特征。

Method: VICP框架利用LLM从少量正负样本对中推断语义身份规则，通过任务特定提示指导视觉基础模型（如DINO）提取身份判别特征，使用动态视觉提示对齐LLM语义概念与VFM预训练先验。

Result: 在ShopID10K数据集和多个ReID基准测试中，VICP在未见类别上明显优于基线方法。

Conclusion: VICP通过LLM和VFM的协同作用，实现了对未见类别的零样本泛化，消除了数据集特定重新训练的需求，为跨类别ReID提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Current object re-identification (ReID) methods train domain-specific models
(e.g., for persons or vehicles), which lack generalization and demand costly
labeled data for new categories. While self-supervised learning reduces
annotation needs by learning instance-wise invariance, it struggles to capture
\textit{identity-sensitive} features critical for ReID. This paper proposes
Visual In-Context Prompting~(VICP), a novel framework where models trained on
seen categories can directly generalize to unseen novel categories using only
\textit{in-context examples} as prompts, without requiring parameter
adaptation. VICP synergizes LLMs and vision foundation models~(VFM): LLMs infer
semantic identity rules from few-shot positive/negative pairs through
task-specific prompting, which then guides a VFM (\eg, DINO) to extract
ID-discriminative features via \textit{dynamic visual prompts}. By aligning
LLM-derived semantic concepts with the VFM's pre-trained prior, VICP enables
generalization to novel categories, eliminating the need for dataset-specific
retraining. To support evaluation, we introduce ShopID10K, a dataset of 10K
object instances from e-commerce platforms, featuring multi-view images and
cross-domain testing. Experiments on ShopID10K and diverse ReID benchmarks
demonstrate that VICP outperforms baselines by a clear margin on unseen
categories. Code is available at https://github.com/Hzzone/VICP.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究使用SegResNet模型在MRI基础的脱腰脾虫医学挑战中进行自动分割，结果显示了在小数据集下的挑战性，不同MRI序列导致性能差异，但仍为自动分割提供了潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脱腰脾虫的准确划分对诊断、治疗规划和结果评估至关重要，但自动分割因解剖变异性和数据集有限而面临挑战。

Method: 使用SegResNet模型（Auto3DSeg架构的一部分），在脱腰脾虫分割挑战的两个MRI任务上进行训练和评估，采用5折交叉验证和STAPLE集成技术，关注解剖相关的关键区域。

Result: 任务1（T1加强MRI）的DSC为0.56，5 mm DSC为0.73，HD95为41.1 mm；任务2（T2加强MRI）的DSC为0.33，5 mm DSC为0.50，HD95为20.1 mm，性能有所下降。

Conclusion: 研究结果显示了在小数据集上进行MRI基础脱腰脾虫分割的挑战性，不同MRI序列导致性能差异，但仍为自动分割提供了潜力，强调需要更大、标准化的MRI数据集来提升模型稳健性和临床应用价值。

Abstract: Accurate delineation of pancreatic tumors is critical for diagnosis,
treatment planning, and outcome assessment, yet automated segmentation remains
challenging due to anatomical variability and limited dataset availability. In
this study, SegResNet models, as part of the Auto3DSeg architecture, were
trained and evaluated on two MRI-based pancreatic tumor segmentation tasks as
part of the 2025 PANTHER Challenge. Algorithm methodology included 5-fold
cross-validation with STAPLE ensembling after focusing on an anatomically
relevant region-of-interest. The Pancreatic Tumor Segmentation on Diagnostic
MRI task 1 training set included 91 T1-weighted arterial contrast-enhanced MRI
with expert annotated pancreas and tumor labels. The Pancreatic Tumor
Segmentation on MR-Linac task 2 training set used 50 T2-weighted MR-Linac cases
with expert annotated pancreas and tumor labels. Algorithm-automated
segmentation performance of pancreatic tumor was assessed using Dice Similarity
Coefficient (DSC), 5 mm DSC, 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95), Mean
Average Surface Distance (MASD), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). For Task 1,
the algorithm achieved a DSC of 0.56, 5 mm DSC of 0.73, HD95 of 41.1 mm, MASD
of 26.0 mm, and RMSE of 5164 mm. For Task 2, performance decreased, with a DSC
of 0.33, 5 mm DSC of 0.50, HD95 of 20.1 mm, MASD of 7.2 mm, and RMSE of 17,203
mm. These findings illustrate the challenges of MRI-based pancreatic tumor
segmentation with small datasets, highlighting variability introduced by
different MRI sequences. Despite modest performance, the results demonstrate
potential for automated delineation and emphasize the need for larger,
standardized MRI datasets to improve model robustness and clinical utility.

*Yidong Zhao,Peter Kellman,Hui Xue,Tongyun Yang,Yi Zhang,Yuchi Han,Orlando Simonetti,Qian Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Reverse Imaging是一种基于物理原理的心脏MRI数据增强方法，通过逆向推断底层自旋属性来解决不同成像序列间的泛化问题，显著提升了分割模型的跨域性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的心脏MRI预训练分割模型难以在不同成像序列间泛化，主要原因是图像对比度的显著差异。虽然成像协议不同，但所有图像都由相同的自旋属性（质子密度、T1、T2值）控制。

Method: 提出Reverse Imaging方法：1）通过解决非线性逆问题从观测图像逆向推断底层自旋属性；2）使用扩散模型学习mSASHA数据集中的自旋先验分布；3）基于推断的自旋属性合成任意新序列的图像。

Result: 该方法能够从MRI图像中获得近似但有意义的自旋属性估计，作为可解释的潜在变量，实现高度灵活的图像合成。实验表明，Reverse Imaging能够在差异极大的图像对比度和成像协议间实现高度准确的分割。

Conclusion: Reverse Imaging从根本上解决了心脏MRI分割的泛化问题，实现了宽谱泛化能力，为跨域医学图像分析提供了新的物理驱动解决方案。

Abstract: Pretrained segmentation models for cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
struggle to generalize across different imaging sequences due to significant
variations in image contrast. These variations arise from changes in imaging
protocols, yet the same fundamental spin properties, including proton density,
T1, and T2 values, govern all acquired images. With this core principle, we
introduce Reverse Imaging, a novel physics-driven method for cardiac MRI data
augmentation and domain adaptation to fundamentally solve the generalization
problem. Our method reversely infers the underlying spin properties from
observed cardiac MRI images, by solving ill-posed nonlinear inverse problems
regularized by the prior distribution of spin properties. We acquire this "spin
prior" by learning a generative diffusion model from the multiparametric
SAturation-recovery single-SHot acquisition sequence (mSASHA) dataset, which
offers joint cardiac T1 and T2 maps. Our method enables approximate but
meaningful spin-property estimates from MR images, which provide an
interpretable "latent variable" that lead to highly flexible image synthesis of
arbitrary novel sequences. We show that Reverse Imaging enables highly accurate
segmentation across vastly different image contrasts and imaging protocols,
realizing wide-spectrum generalization of cardiac MRI segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PHD是一种新颖的个性化3D人体网格恢复方法，通过用户特定的形状信息来提高视频姿态估计精度，使用点扩散变换器和点蒸馏采样损失来构建形状条件化的3D姿态先验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HMR方法为了泛化性而设计为用户无关的，在通过2D图像约束优化姿态时会损害3D精度，无法同时考虑个体特定身体形状和3D姿态的合理性。

Method: 首先校准用户身体形状，然后基于该形状进行个性化姿态拟合。开发了身体形状条件化的3D姿态先验（Point Diffusion Transformer），通过Point Distillation Sampling损失迭代指导姿态拟合。

Result: 不仅提高了骨盆对齐的姿态精度，还提高了绝对姿态精度（先前工作常忽视的重要指标）。方法数据高效，仅需合成数据训练，可作为即插即用模块与现有3D姿态估计器集成。

Conclusion: PHD通过解耦形状校准和姿态拟合过程，有效减轻了对2D约束的过度依赖，显著提升了3D人体姿态估计的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: We introduce PHD, a novel approach for personalized 3D human mesh recovery
(HMR) and body fitting that leverages user-specific shape information to
improve pose estimation accuracy from videos. Traditional HMR methods are
designed to be user-agnostic and optimized for generalization. While these
methods often refine poses using constraints derived from the 2D image to
improve alignment, this process compromises 3D accuracy by failing to jointly
account for person-specific body shapes and the plausibility of 3D poses. In
contrast, our pipeline decouples this process by first calibrating the user's
body shape and then employing a personalized pose fitting process conditioned
on that shape. To achieve this, we develop a body shape-conditioned 3D pose
prior, implemented as a Point Diffusion Transformer, which iteratively guides
the pose fitting via a Point Distillation Sampling loss. This learned 3D pose
prior effectively mitigates errors arising from an over-reliance on 2D
constraints. Consequently, our approach improves not only pelvis-aligned pose
accuracy but also absolute pose accuracy -- an important metric often
overlooked by prior work. Furthermore, our method is highly data-efficient,
requiring only synthetic data for training, and serves as a versatile
plug-and-play module that can be seamlessly integrated with existing 3D pose
estimators to enhance their performance. Project page:

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散模型的高效3D人体姿态估计框架，通过分层时间剪枝策略在保持运动动态的同时大幅降低计算成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽然能生成高质量的3D人体姿态，但其迭代特性和多假设需求导致计算成本过高，需要更高效的解决方案

Method: 采用分层时间剪枝(HTP)策略：1)TCEP通过自适应时间图分析帧间运动相关性识别关键帧；2)SFT MHSA利用帧级稀疏性减少注意力计算；3)MGPTP通过聚类进行细粒度语义剪枝

Result: 在Human3.6M和MPI-INF-3DHP数据集上，训练MACs减少38.5%，推理MACs减少56.8%，推理速度平均提升81.1%，同时达到最先进性能

Conclusion: 提出的HTP策略有效解决了扩散模型在3D人体姿态估计中的计算效率问题，在显著降低计算成本的同时保持了优异的性能表现

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong capabilities in generating
high-fidelity 3D human poses, yet their iterative nature and multi-hypothesis
requirements incur substantial computational cost. In this paper, we propose an
Efficient Diffusion-Based 3D Human Pose Estimation framework with a
Hierarchical Temporal Pruning (HTP) strategy, which dynamically prunes
redundant pose tokens across both frame and semantic levels while preserving
critical motion dynamics. HTP operates in a staged, top-down manner: (1)
Temporal Correlation-Enhanced Pruning (TCEP) identifies essential frames by
analyzing inter-frame motion correlations through adaptive temporal graph
construction; (2) Sparse-Focused Temporal MHSA (SFT MHSA) leverages the
resulting frame-level sparsity to reduce attention computation, focusing on
motion-relevant tokens; and (3) Mask-Guided Pose Token Pruner (MGPTP) performs
fine-grained semantic pruning via clustering, retaining only the most
informative pose tokens. Experiments on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP show that
HTP reduces training MACs by 38.5\%, inference MACs by 56.8\%, and improves
inference speed by an average of 81.1\% compared to prior diffusion-based
methods, while achieving state-of-the-art performance.

<details>

Motivation: OCT技术能获取高分辨率3D指纹数据，但数据采集成本高、耗时长，导致大规模公开数据集稀缺，阻碍了深度学习算法的发展

Method: 三阶段框架：1）2D风格转换模块将二值指纹转为灰度图像；2）3D结构扩展网络将2D图像外推为3D解剖体积；3）基于3D GAN的OCT真实感细化器添加纹理和噪声

Result: 生成了42万个合成样本，通过在合成数据上预训练并在小规模真实数据上微调，将等错误率从15.62%降至2.50%

Conclusion: Print2Volume有效解决了OCT指纹数据稀缺问题，生成的合成数据质量高，能显著提升识别性能

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) enables the acquisition of
high-resolution, three-dimensional fingerprint data, capturing rich subsurface
structures for robust biometric recognition. However, the high cost and
time-consuming nature of OCT data acquisition have led to a scarcity of
large-scale public datasets, significantly hindering the development of
advanced algorithms, particularly data-hungry deep learning models. To address
this critical bottleneck, this paper introduces Print2Volume, a novel framework
for generating realistic, synthetic OCT-based 3D fingerprints from 2D
fingerprint image. Our framework operates in three sequential stages: (1) a 2D
style transfer module that converts a binary fingerprint into a grayscale
images mimicking the style of a Z-direction mean-projected OCT scan; (2) a 3D
Structure Expansion Network that extrapolates the 2D im-age into a plausible 3D
anatomical volume; and (3) an OCT Realism Refiner, based on a 3D GAN, that
renders the structural volume with authentic textures, speckle noise, and other
imaging characteristics. Using Print2Volume, we generated a large-scale
synthetic dataset of 420,000 samples. Quantitative experiments demonstrate the
high quality of our synthetic data and its significant impact on recognition
performance. By pre-training a recognition model on our synthetic data and
fine-tuning it on a small real-world dataset, we achieved a remarkable
reduction in the Equal Error Rate (EER) from 15.62% to 2.50% on the ZJUT-EIFD
benchmark, proving the effectiveness of our approach in overcoming data
scarcity.

Conclusion: GLENDA数据集的公布将有助于推动腾镜手术视频自动分析技术的发展，解决医学领域数据稀缺的挑战。

Abstract: Gynecologic laparoscopy as a type of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is
performed via a live feed of a patient's abdomen surveying the insertion and
handling of various instruments for conducting treatment. Adopting this kind of
surgical intervention not only facilitates a great variety of treatments, the
possibility of recording said video streams is as well essential for numerous
post-surgical activities, such as treatment planning, case documentation and
education. Nonetheless, the process of manually analyzing surgical recordings,
as it is carried out in current practice, usually proves tediously
time-consuming. In order to improve upon this situation, more sophisticated
computer vision as well as machine learning approaches are actively developed.
Since most of such approaches heavily rely on sample data, which especially in
the medical field is only sparsely available, with this work we publish the
Gynecologic Laparoscopy ENdometriosis DAtaset (GLENDA) - an image dataset
containing region-based annotations of a common medical condition named
endometriosis, i.e. the dislocation of uterine-like tissue. The dataset is the
first of its kind and it has been created in collaboration with leading medical
experts in the field.

Motivation: 手术视频记录已成为医学内窥镜领域的重要信息源，但自动内容索引（基于内容的医学视频存档搜索基础）由于特殊的视频内容仍然是一个巨大挑战。

Method: 使用基于区域的全卷积网络进行实例感知的（1）器械分割和（2）器械识别，分别处理二值分割（器械与背景）和多类器械识别（识别器械类型）。

Result: 即使训练样本数量适中，也能以相当高的准确率定位和分割器械区域；但确定具体器械类型仍然非常具有挑战性，因为手术器械本身具有高度相似性。

Conclusion: 手术器械分割技术已经相对成熟，但器械类型识别由于器械间的高度相似性仍需进一步研究改进。

Abstract: Recorded videos from surgeries have become an increasingly important
information source for the field of medical endoscopy, since the recorded
footage shows every single detail of the surgery. However, while video
recording is straightforward these days, automatic content indexing - the basis
for content-based search in a medical video archive - is still a great
challenge due to the very special video content. In this work, we investigate
segmentation and recognition of surgical instruments in videos recorded from
laparoscopic gynecology. More precisely, we evaluate the achievable performance
of segmenting surgical instruments from their background by using a
region-based fully convolutional network for instance-aware (1) instrument
segmentation as well as (2) instrument recognition. While the first part
addresses only binary segmentation of instances (i.e., distinguishing between
instrument or background) we also investigate multi-class instrument
recognition (i.e., identifying the type of instrument). Our evaluation results
show that even with a moderately low number of training examples, we are able
to localize and segment instrument regions with a pretty high accuracy.
However, the results also reveal that determining the particular instrument is
still very challenging, due to the inherently high similarity of surgical
instruments.

Motivation: 因为目前缺乏WSI元数据标准，AI算法训练和验证时需要手动检查图像内容，这在包含数百万对象的大规模集合中不可行。

Method: 提出一种通用框架来生成WSI的2D索引地图，并为特定应用领域提供配置机制。组织为三层结构：来源层、组织类型层和病理改变层，每个层都将WSI的区域分配到特定类别。

Result: 在临床病理学领域进行了实践验证，使用通用语法和语义实现不同目录之间的互操性。

Conclusion: 该标准框架能够为WSI集合添加详细的组织地图，在WSI目录、机器学习和图基于WSI表示等领域都显示出其优势和适用性。

Abstract: A Whole Slide Image (WSI) is a high-resolution digital image created by
scanning an entire glass slide containing a biological specimen, such as tissue
sections or cell samples, at multiple magnifications. These images can be
viewed, analyzed, shared digitally, and are used today for Artificial
Intelligence (AI) algorithm development. WSIs are used in a variety of fields,
including pathology for diagnosing diseases and oncology for cancer research.
They are also utilized in neurology, veterinary medicine, hematology,
microbiology, dermatology, pharmacology, toxicology, immunology, and forensic
science.
  When assembling cohorts for the training or validation of an AI algorithm, it
is essential to know what is present on such a WSI. However, there is currently
no standard for this metadata, so such selection has mainly been done through
manual inspection, which is not suitable for large collections with several
million objects.
  We propose a general framework to generate a 2D index map for WSI and a
profiling mechanism for specific application domains. We demonstrate this
approach in the field of clinical pathology, using common syntax and semantics
to achieve interoperability between different catalogs.
  Our approach augments each WSI collection with a detailed tissue map that
provides fine-grained information about the WSI content. The tissue map is
organized into three layers: source, tissue type, and pathological alterations,
with each layer assigning segments of the WSI to specific classes.
  We illustrate the advantages and applicability of the proposed standard
through specific examples in WSI catalogs, Machine Learning (ML), and
graph-based WSI representations.

Result: 在CIFAR100和ImageNet100上评估性能下降，相比有监督方法获得竞争性结果，比最先进的class-iNCD方法准确率高出5%以上

Conclusion: ICPL方法有效解决了无标注增量学习问题，在细粒度数据集上展示了实际应用价值，计算复杂度适合资源受限环境

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many
computer vision tasks. However, in real-world scenarios, novel classes that
were unseen during training often emerge, requiring models to acquire new
knowledge incrementally. Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) methods enable a
model to learn novel classes while retaining knowledge of previous classes.
However, these methods make the strong assumption that the incremental dataset
is fully labeled, which is unrealistic in practice. In this work, we propose an
unsupervised Incremental Learning method using Confidence-based Pseudo-labels
(ICPL), which replaces human annotations with pseudo-labels, enabling
incremental learning from unlabeled datasets. We integrate these pseudo-labels
into various CIL methods with confidence-based selection and evaluate
performance degradation on CIFAR100 and ImageNet100. Then, we compare our
approach to popular Class Incremental Novel Category Discovery (class-iNCD)
methods addressing similar challenges. Additionally, we apply our method to
fine-grained datasets to demonstrate its real-world practicality and measure
its computational complexity to validate its suitability for
resource-constrained environments. ICPL achieves competitive results compared
to supervised methods and outperforms state-of-the-art class-iNCD methods by
more than 5% in final accuracy.

Abstract: Synthetic medical data offers a scalable solution for training robust models,
but significant domain gaps limit its generalizability to real-world clinical
settings. This paper addresses the challenge of cross-domain translation
between synthetic and real X-ray images of the head, focusing on bridging
discrepancies in attenuation behavior, noise characteristics, and soft tissue
representation. We propose MedShift, a unified class-conditional generative
model based on Flow Matching and Schrodinger Bridges, which enables
high-fidelity, unpaired image translation across multiple domains. Unlike prior
approaches that require domain-specific training or rely on paired data,
MedShift learns a shared domain-agnostic latent space and supports seamless
translation between any pair of domains seen during training. We introduce
X-DigiSkull, a new dataset comprising aligned synthetic and real skull X-rays
under varying radiation doses, to benchmark domain translation models.
Experimental results demonstrate that, despite its smaller model size compared
to diffusion-based approaches, MedShift offers strong performance and remains
flexible at inference time, as it can be tuned to prioritize either perceptual
fidelity or structural consistency, making it a scalable and generalizable
solution for domain adaptation in medical imaging. The code and dataset are

Abstract: Trees are key components of the terrestrial biosphere, playing vital roles in
ecosystem function, climate regulation, and the bioeconomy. However,
large-scale monitoring of individual trees remains limited by inadequate
modelling. Available global products have focused on binary tree cover or
canopy height, which do not explicitely identify trees at individual level. In
this study, we present a deep learning approach for detecting large individual
trees in 3-m resolution PlanetScope imagery at a global scale. We simulate tree
crowns with Gaussian kernels of scalable size, allowing the extraction of crown
centers and the generation of binary tree cover maps. Training is based on
billions of points automatically extracted from airborne lidar data, enabling
the model to successfully identify trees both inside and outside forests. We
compare against existing tree cover maps and airborne lidar with
state-of-the-art performance (fractional cover R$^2 = 0.81$ against aerial
lidar), report balanced detection metrics across biomes, and demonstrate how
detection can be further improved through fine-tuning with manual labels. Our
method offers a scalable framework for global, high-resolution tree monitoring,
and is adaptable to future satellite missions offering improved imagery.

Conclusion: M框架为动态场景的高斯泼溅提供了一种可扩展且高效的解决方案，在保持渲染质量的同时大幅提升训练效率

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables high-fidelity real-time rendering, a key
requirement for immersive applications. However, the extension of 3DGS to
dynamic scenes remains limitations on the substantial data volume of dense
Gaussians and the prolonged training time required for each frame. This paper
presents \M, a scalable Gaussian Splatting framework designed for efficient
training in streaming tasks. Specifically, Gaussian spheres are hierarchically
organized by scale within an anchor-based structure. Coarser-level Gaussians
represent the low-resolution structure of the scene, while finer-level
Gaussians, responsible for detailed high-fidelity rendering, are selectively
activated by the coarser-level Gaussians. To further reduce computational
overhead, we introduce a hybrid deformation and spawning strategy that models
motion of inter-frame through Gaussian deformation and triggers Gaussian
spawning to characterize wide-range motion. Additionally, a bidirectional
adaptive masking mechanism enhances training efficiency by removing static
regions and prioritizing informative viewpoints. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that \M~ achieves superior visual quality while significantly
reducing training time compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型计算需求高，难以在本地设备部署。需要开发轻量级但性能相当的图像描述解决方案。

Method: 基于125M参数语言模型构建专家模型，并通过DeepLens提取详细视觉表示，Sharp-Eyed Refinement框架改进视觉定位。

Conclusion: 轻量级专家模型可作为设备端应用的强大视觉专家，Sharp-Eyed Refinement框架成功缓解了视觉盲区问题。

Abstract: Image captioning is fundamental for applications like video instruction
systems and exploration robots, yet deploying such models on local devices is
challenging due to the high computational demands of multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). To address this, we first explore lightweight captioning by
implementing a specialist based on a 125M-parameter language model, 56 times
smaller than LLaMA-7B, and evaluating its performance on both single-sentence
and detailed captioning tasks. Surprisingly, we find that our model can achieve
performance comparable to large multimodal generalists, suggesting its
potential to serve as a strong visual specialist for on-device applications.
While promising, our model also exhibits a limitation: like other MLLMs, it
suffers from visual blindness, occasionally resulting in semantic captioning
errors. We carry out toy experiments and investigate the underlying causes,
where we observe that the problems arise from ineffective attention mechanisms
and limited visual representations. To alleviate them, we develop a novel
captioning framework, Sharp-Eyed Refinement, which enhances caption quality
through improved visual grounding. At its core, our DeepLens extracts detailed
visual representations by concentrating on informative regions identified
during the initial glance. Our experiments confirm both the advantages of our
specialist over prior small captioning models and large generalists and the
effectiveness of our framework.

underexplored. In this benchmarking study, we systematically evaluate the
impact of key design choices: classification head architecture, fine-tuning
strategy, and aggregation method, on the performance and efficiency of
federated FM tuning using brain MRI data. Using a large multi-cohort dataset,
we find that the architecture of the classification head substantially
influences performance, freezing the FM encoder achieves comparable results to
full fine-tuning, and advanced aggregation methods outperform standard
federated averaging. Our results offer practical insights for deploying FMs in
decentralized clinical settings and highlight trade-offs that should guide

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OOD检测方法要么只关注单一技术家族，要么在特定类型OOD数据集上评估，忽略了结合多种现有解决方案的潜力

Method: 提出多方法集成(MME)评分，将最先进的OOD检测器统一为单一更有效的评分函数，结合特征截断和多种评分函数

Result: 在大型和小型基准测试中，MME显著优于最新方法，在ImageNet-1K基准上平均FPR95达到27.57%，比最佳基线提升6%

Conclusion: 理论分析和实验证明，结合多种OOD检测技术可以显著提升检测性能，MME方法为安全关键应用提供了更可靠的OOD检测解决方案

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is essential for neural networks
operating in open-world settings, particularly in safety-critical applications.
Existing methods have improved OOD detection by leveraging two main techniques:
feature truncation, which increases the separation between in-distribution (ID)
and OOD samples, and scoring functions, which assign scores to distinguish
between ID and OOD data. However, most approaches either focus on a single
family of techniques or evaluate their effectiveness on a specific type of OOD
dataset, overlooking the potential of combining multiple existing solutions.
Motivated by this observation, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate
that state-of-the-art feature truncation and scoring functions can be
effectively combined. Moreover, we show that aggregating multiple scoring
functions enhances robustness against various types of OOD samples. Based on
these insights, we propose the Multi-Method Ensemble (MME) score, which unifies
state-of-the-art OOD detectors into a single, more effective scoring function.
Extensive experiments on both large-scale and small-scale benchmarks, covering
near-OOD and far-OOD scenarios, show that MME significantly outperforms recent
state-of-the-art methods across all benchmarks. Notably, using the BiT model,
our method achieves an average FPR95 of 27.57% on the challenging ImageNet-1K
benchmark, improving performance by 6% over the best existing baseline.

Abstract: Current ship detection techniques based on remote sensing imagery primarily
rely on the object detection capabilities of deep neural networks (DNNs).
However, DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks, which can lead to
misclassification by the detection model or complete evasion of the targets.
Numerous studies have demonstrated that data transformation-based methods can
improve the transferability of adversarial examples. However, excessive
augmentation of image backgrounds or irrelevant regions may introduce
unnecessary interference, resulting in false detections of the object detection
model. These errors are not caused by the adversarial patches themselves but
rather by the over-augmentation of background and non-target areas. This paper
proposes a localized augmentation method that applies augmentation only to the
target regions, avoiding any influence on non-target areas. By reducing
background interference, this approach enables the loss function to focus more
directly on the impact of the adversarial patch on the detection model, thereby
improving the attack success rate. Experiments conducted on the HRSC2016
dataset demonstrate that the proposed method effectively increases the success
rate of adversarial patch attacks and enhances their transferability.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了首个针对长视频幻觉的基准测试ELV-Halluc，专门研究语义聚合幻觉(SAH)，发现SAH随语义复杂性增加而加剧，并提出了位置编码和DPO策略来缓解SAH问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频多模态大语言模型在视频理解方面取得显著进展，但仍容易产生与视频输入不一致或无关的幻觉内容。之前的幻觉基准主要关注短视频，且对幻觉原因的归因过于简化，忽略了帧级语义正确但聚合时出错的新型幻觉类型。

Method: 提出了ELV-Halluc基准测试，系统研究语义聚合幻觉(SAH)。通过实验验证SAH的存在及其与语义复杂性的关系，探讨了位置编码策略和DPO（直接偏好优化）策略来缓解SAH问题，并构建了8K对抗数据对数据集。

Result: 实验证实了SAH的存在，发现SAH随语义复杂性增加而增加，模型在快速变化的语义上更容易产生SAH。采用位置编码和DPO策略后，在ELV-Halluc和Video-MME基准上均取得改进，SAH比率大幅降低了27.7%。

Conclusion: 该研究首次系统性地识别和分析了长视频中的语义聚合幻觉问题，提出了有效的缓解策略，为视频多模态大语言模型的幻觉问题提供了新的研究视角和解决方案。

Abstract: Video multimodal large language models (Video-MLLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in video understanding. However, they remain vulnerable to
hallucination-producing content inconsistent with or unrelated to video inputs.
Previous video hallucination benchmarks primarily focus on short-videos. They
attribute hallucinations to factors such as strong language priors, missing
frames, or vision-language biases introduced by the visual encoder. While these
causes indeed account for most hallucinations in short videos, they still
oversimplify the cause of hallucinations. Sometimes, models generate incorrect
outputs but with correct frame-level semantics. We refer to this type of
hallucination as Semantic Aggregation Hallucination (SAH), which arises during
the process of aggregating frame-level semantics into event-level semantic
groups. Given that SAH becomes particularly critical in long videos due to
increased semantic complexity across multiple events, it is essential to
separate and thoroughly investigate the causes of this type of hallucination.
To address the above issues, we introduce ELV-Halluc, the first benchmark
dedicated to long-video hallucination, enabling a systematic investigation of
SAH. Our experiments confirm the existence of SAH and show that it increases
with semantic complexity. Additionally, we find that models are more prone to
SAH on rapidly changing semantics. Moreover, we discuss potential approaches to
mitigate SAH. We demonstrate that positional encoding strategy contributes to
alleviating SAH, and further adopt DPO strategy to enhance the model's ability
to distinguish semantics within and across events. To support this, we curate a
dataset of 8K adversarial data pairs and achieve improvements on both
ELV-Halluc and Video-MME, including a substantial 27.7% reduction in SAH ratio.

Motivation: 现有的基于patch的基础模型特征在处理显微图像时存在两个主要问题：1) 无法有效表示微图像中的细粒度特征；2) 难以处理材料和生物图像分析中的大尺寸图像。需要一种高效的方法来提升特征分辨率。

Method: 训练一个卷积神经网络，参考输入图像对低分辨率（大patch尺寸）的基础模型特征进行上采样。该上采样器网络无需额外训练即可应用于各种显微图像的特征化和分割任务。

Result: 该方法成功应用于植物细胞、锂离子电池阴极和有机晶体等多种显微图像的分割。上采样后的丰富特征能够分离难以分割的相（如发丝裂纹），交互式分割相比传统卷积网络需要更少的标签和更短的时间就能产生高质量分割结果。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效的特征上采样解决方案，显著提升了显微图像分析中细粒度特征的处理能力，在保持计算效率的同时大幅改善了分割性能，为材料科学和生物医学图像分析提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Feature foundation models - usually vision transformers - offer rich semantic
descriptors of images, useful for downstream tasks such as (interactive)
segmentation and object detection. For computational efficiency these
descriptors are often patch-based, and so struggle to represent the fine
features often present in micrographs; they also struggle with the large image
sizes present in materials and biological image analysis. In this work, we
train a convolutional neural network to upsample low-resolution (i.e, large
patch size) foundation model features with reference to the input image. We
apply this upsampler network (without any further training) to efficiently
featurise and then segment a variety of microscopy images, including plant
cells, a lithium-ion battery cathode and organic crystals. The richness of
these upsampled features admits separation of hard to segment phases, like
hairline cracks. We demonstrate that interactive segmentation with these deep
features produces high-quality segmentations far faster and with far fewer
labels than training or finetuning a more traditional convolutional network.

Conclusion: HCCM框架有效解决了无人机场景中的细粒度视觉语言理解问题，在标准数据集和零样本泛化方面都表现出色，为自然语言引导的无人机应用提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Natural Language-Guided Drones (NLGD) provide a novel paradigm for tasks such
as target matching and navigation. However, the wide field of view and complex
compositional semantics in drone scenarios pose challenges for vision-language
understanding. Mainstream Vision-Language Models (VLMs) emphasize global
alignment while lacking fine-grained semantics, and existing hierarchical
methods depend on precise entity partitioning and strict containment, limiting
effectiveness in dynamic environments. To address this, we propose the
Hierarchical Cross-Granularity Contrastive and Matching learning (HCCM)
framework with two components: (1) Region-Global Image-Text Contrastive
Learning (RG-ITC), which avoids precise scene partitioning and captures
hierarchical local-to-global semantics by contrasting local visual regions with
global text and vice versa; (2) Region-Global Image-Text Matching (RG-ITM),
which dispenses with rigid constraints and instead evaluates local semantic
consistency within global cross-modal representations, enhancing compositional
reasoning. Moreover, drone text descriptions are often incomplete or ambiguous,
destabilizing alignment. HCCM introduces a Momentum Contrast and Distillation
(MCD) mechanism to improve robustness. Experiments on GeoText-1652 show HCCM
achieves state-of-the-art Recall@1 of 28.8% (image retrieval) and 14.7% (text
retrieval). On the unseen ERA dataset, HCCM demonstrates strong zero-shot
generalization with 39.93% mean recall (mR), outperforming fine-tuned
baselines.

Conclusion: 通过生成式方法和自监督学习潜在空间，成功实现了从单张图像到完整3D场景的重建，解决了传统回归方法的模糊性问题

Abstract: Gaussian splatting typically requires dense observations of the scene and can
fail to reconstruct occluded and unobserved areas. We propose a latent
diffusion model to reconstruct a complete 3D scene with Gaussian splats,
including the occluded parts, from only a single image during inference.
Completing the unobserved surfaces of a scene is challenging due to the
ambiguity of the plausible surfaces. Conventional methods use a
regression-based formulation to predict a single "mode" for occluded and
out-of-frustum surfaces, leading to blurriness, implausibility, and failure to
capture multiple possible explanations. Thus, they often address this problem
partially, focusing either on objects isolated from the background,
reconstructing only visible surfaces, or failing to extrapolate far from the
input views. In contrast, we propose a generative formulation to learn a
distribution of 3D representations of Gaussian splats conditioned on a single
input image. To address the lack of ground-truth training data, we propose a
Variational AutoReconstructor to learn a latent space only from 2D images in a
self-supervised manner, over which a diffusion model is trained. Our method
generates faithful reconstructions and diverse samples with the ability to
complete the occluded surfaces for high-quality 360-degree renderings.

Conclusion: 结合CLIP先验知识和不确定性感知采样，为成对排序提供了高效可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: Pairwise comparison is often favored over absolute rating or ordinal
classification in subjective or difficult annotation tasks due to its improved
reliability. However, exhaustive comparisons require a massive number of
annotations (O(n^2)). Recent work has greatly reduced the annotation burden
(O(n log n)) by actively sampling pairwise comparisons using a sorting
algorithm. We further improve annotation efficiency by (1) roughly pre-ordering
items using the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model
hierarchically without training, and (2) replacing easy, obvious human
comparisons with automated comparisons. The proposed EZ-Sort first produces a
CLIP-based zero-shot pre-ordering, then initializes bucket-aware Elo scores,
and finally runs an uncertainty-guided human-in-the-loop MergeSort. Validation
was conducted using various datasets: face-age estimation (FGNET), historical
image chronology (DHCI), and retinal image quality assessment (EyePACS). It
showed that EZ-Sort reduced human annotation cost by 90.5% compared to
exhaustive pairwise comparisons and by 19.8% compared to prior work (when n =
100), while improving or maintaining inter-rater reliability. These results
demonstrate that combining CLIP-based priors with uncertainty-aware sampling
yields an efficient and scalable solution for pairwise ranking.

Method: 采用扩散Transformer架构和独特的三变量扩散过程，联合建模人体运动、物体轨迹和接触序列。在头部中心规范空间中操作，增强对全局方向的鲁棒性。提出基于传送带的推理方法，可处理任意长度序列。

Result: 通过广泛评估，ECHO在自我中心人-物交互重建方面超越了现有方法，达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: ECHO首次提出了从最小观察中统一恢复三种模态的框架，为可穿戴设备环境下的人-物交互建模提供了有效的解决方案，具有灵活的输入配置和处理任意长度序列的能力。

Abstract: Modeling human-object interactions (HOI) from an egocentric perspective is a
largely unexplored yet important problem due to the increasing adoption of
wearable devices, such as smart glasses and watches. We investigate how much
information about interaction can be recovered from only head and wrists
tracking. Our answer is ECHO (Ego-Centric modeling of Human-Object
interactions), which, for the first time, proposes a unified framework to
recover three modalities: human pose, object motion, and contact from such
minimal observation. ECHO employs a Diffusion Transformer architecture and a
unique three-variate diffusion process, which jointly models human motion,
object trajectory, and contact sequence, allowing for flexible input
configurations. Our method operates in a head-centric canonical space,
enhancing robustness to global orientation. We propose a conveyor-based
inference, which progressively increases the diffusion timestamp with the frame
position, allowing us to process sequences of any length. Through extensive
evaluation, we demonstrate that ECHO outperforms existing methods that do not
offer the same flexibility, setting a state-of-the-art in egocentric HOI
reconstruction.

*Juneyoung Ro,Namwoo Kim,Yoonjin Yoon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究比较了三种现成视觉语言模型在城市场景中的空间推理能力，发现虽然零样本表现尚可，但使用合成的思维链监督数据集进行微调能显著提升性能，特别是在否定和反事实推理等挑战性问题类型上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在通用场景上预训练后，在城市场景中的细粒度空间推理能力（如物体、布局和深度线索）的迁移效果尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 构建了基于街景图像分割、深度和物体检测预测的合成VQA数据集，每个问题都配有LLM生成的思维链答案用于逐步推理监督。比较了BLIP-2、InstructBLIP和LLaVA-1.5三种模型的零样本性能和微调效果。

Result: 视觉语言模型在零样本设置下表现合理，但使用合成的思维链监督数据集进行微调后性能大幅提升，特别是在否定和反事实推理等挑战性问题类型上。

Conclusion: 该研究引入了城市空间推理作为视觉语言模型的新挑战，并展示了合成数据集构建作为将通用模型适配到专业领域的实用路径。

Abstract: Effectively understanding urban scenes requires fine-grained spatial
reasoning about objects, layouts, and depth cues. However, how well current
vision-language models (VLMs), pretrained on general scenes, transfer these
abilities to urban domain remains underexplored. To address this gap, we
conduct a comparative study of three off-the-shelf VLMs-BLIP-2, InstructBLIP,
and LLaVA-1.5-evaluating both zero-shot performance and the effects of
fine-tuning with a synthetic VQA dataset specific to urban scenes. We construct
such dataset from segmentation, depth, and object detection predictions of
street-view images, pairing each question with LLM-generated Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) answers for step-by-step reasoning supervision. Results show that while
VLMs perform reasonably well in zero-shot settings, fine-tuning with our
synthetic CoT-supervised dataset substantially boosts performance, especially
for challenging question types such as negation and counterfactuals. This study
introduces urban spatial reasoning as a new challenge for VLMs and demonstrates
synthetic dataset construction as a practical path for adapting general-purpose
models to specialized domains.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Temporal Flow Matching (TFM)方法，用于医学图像的时间动态建模，能够处理3D体积、多时间点扫描和不规则采样，在三个公共纵向数据集上超越了现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法大多只考虑单一时间上下文，或局限于分类回归任务，无法进行细粒度空间预测，且往往受限于单时间点、特定疾病或技术限制。

Method: Temporal Flow Matching (TFM)是一种统一的生成式轨迹方法，学习底层时间分布，可回退到最近图像预测器，支持3D体积、多先验扫描和不规则采样。

Result: 在三个公共纵向数据集上的广泛基准测试表明，TFM始终超越自然成像中的时空方法，为4D医学图像预测建立了新的最先进和稳健基准。

Conclusion: TFM填补了医学成像中时间动态建模的基本空白，为疾病进展建模、治疗规划和解剖发育跟踪等应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding temporal dynamics in medical imaging is crucial for
applications such as disease progression modeling, treatment planning and
anatomical development tracking. However, most deep learning methods either
consider only single temporal contexts, or focus on tasks like classification
or regression, limiting their ability for fine-grained spatial predictions.
While some approaches have been explored, they are often limited to single
timepoints, specific diseases or have other technical restrictions. To address
this fundamental gap, we introduce Temporal Flow Matching (TFM), a unified
generative trajectory method that (i) aims to learn the underlying temporal
distribution, (ii) by design can fall back to a nearest image predictor, i.e.
predicting the last context image (LCI), as a special case, and (iii) supports
$3D$ volumes, multiple prior scans, and irregular sampling. Extensive
benchmarks on three public longitudinal datasets show that TFM consistently
surpasses spatio-temporal methods from natural imaging, establishing a new
state-of-the-art and robust baseline for $4D$ medical image prediction.

TL;DR: 通过深度学习框架结合本前CT和本后病理全手片图像，实现了更准确的肾细胞癌复发风险预测，中间融合方式表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Leibovich评分在肾清细细胞癌复发风险预测中分辨率有限且缺少形态学信息，需要更个性化的多模态预测方法。

Method: 使用预训练编码器和Cox生存模型，构建模块化深度学习框架，测试单模态、晚期融合和中间融合等不同配置。

Result: 病理WSI模型表现明显优于CT模型，中间融合方式最佳，最佳模型接近调整Leibovich评分。形态学信息通过融合增加价值。

Conclusion: 基础模型多模态融合在肾癌复发风险预测中具有可行性，未来需探索更优的融合策略和更大规模数据集。

Abstract: Recurrence risk estimation in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is
essential for guiding postoperative surveillance and treatment. The Leibovich
score remains widely used for stratifying distant recurrence risk but offers
limited patient-level resolution and excludes imaging information. This study
evaluates multimodal recurrence prediction by integrating preoperative computed
tomography (CT) and postoperative histopathology whole-slide images (WSIs). A
modular deep learning framework with pretrained encoders and Cox-based survival
modeling was tested across unimodal, late fusion, and intermediate fusion
setups. In a real-world ccRCC cohort, WSI-based models consistently
outperformed CT-only models, underscoring the prognostic strength of pathology.
Intermediate fusion further improved performance, with the best model
(TITAN-CONCH with ResNet-18) approaching the adjusted Leibovich score. Random
tie-breaking narrowed the gap between the clinical baseline and learned models,
suggesting discretization may overstate individualized performance. Using
simple embedding concatenation, radiology added value primarily through fusion.
These findings demonstrate the feasibility of foundation model-based multimodal
integration for personalized ccRCC risk prediction. Future work should explore
more expressive fusion strategies, larger multimodal datasets, and
general-purpose CT encoders to better match pathology modeling capacity.

TL;DR: 提出了一种深度展开网络(DUN)，通过自适应带宽保持模型(ABPM)和相位域复值去噪器(PCD)来解决计算机生成全息术中的非线性不适定问题，实现了超过35dB的PSNR性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习方法将重建模型视为黑盒，忽略了物理关系，降低了可解释性和灵活性；CNN-based方法感受野有限，难以捕捉长距离依赖；ASM-based方法局限于有限近场。

Method: 提出深度展开网络(DUN)，将梯度下降分解为两个模块：自适应带宽保持模型(ABPM)允许更宽的工作距离，相位域复值去噪器(PCD)采用复值可变形自注意力模块捕捉全局特征。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据上实现了最先进的性能，PSNR超过35dB，ABPM相比ASM-based方法具有更宽的工作距离，PCD有效提升了全局特征捕捉能力。

Conclusion: 所提出的DUN网络通过结合物理模型和深度学习，解决了CGH中的关键挑战，在性能和灵活性方面都取得了显著提升，为计算机生成全息术提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Computer-generated holography (CGH) has gained wide attention with deep
learning-based algorithms. However, due to its nonlinear and ill-posed nature,
challenges remain in achieving accurate and stable reconstruction.
Specifically, ($i$) the widely used end-to-end networks treat the
reconstruction model as a black box, ignoring underlying physical
relationships, which reduces interpretability and flexibility. ($ii$) CNN-based
CGH algorithms have limited receptive fields, hindering their ability to
capture long-range dependencies and global context. ($iii$) Angular spectrum
method (ASM)-based models are constrained to finite near-fields.In this paper,
we propose a Deep Unfolding Network (DUN) that decomposes gradient descent into
two modules: an adaptive bandwidth-preserving model (ABPM) and a phase-domain
complex-valued denoiser (PCD), providing more flexibility. ABPM allows for
wider working distances compared to ASM-based methods. At the same time, PCD
leverages its complex-valued deformable self-attention module to capture global
features and enhance performance, achieving a PSNR over 35 dB. Experiments on
simulated and real data show state-of-the-art results.

Motivation: 解决全身PET/CT中由于示踪剂异质性、生理性摄取和多中心变异性导致的精确病灶分割难题，开发能够保持人机交互的高效分割方法。

Method: 扩展autoPET III获胜的nnU-Net流水线，将用户提供的前景和背景点击编码为额外输入通道；系统研究空间提示表示方法，证明欧几里得距离变换(EDT)编码优于高斯核；提出在线模拟用户交互和自定义点采样策略以提高鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提示式模型在多示踪剂、多中心PET/CT中具有实现高效用户引导分割工作流程的潜力，代码已公开。

Abstract: Whole-body PET/CT is a cornerstone of oncological imaging, yet accurate
lesion segmentation remains challenging due to tracer heterogeneity,
physiological uptake, and multi-center variability. While fully automated
methods have advanced substantially, clinical practice benefits from approaches
that keep humans in the loop to efficiently refine predicted masks. The
autoPET/CT IV challenge addresses this need by introducing interactive
segmentation tasks based on simulated user prompts. In this work, we present
our submission to Task 1. Building on the winning autoPET III nnU-Net pipeline,
we extend the framework with promptable capabilities by encoding user-provided
foreground and background clicks as additional input channels. We
systematically investigate representations for spatial prompts and demonstrate
that Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT) encodings consistently outperform
Gaussian kernels. Furthermore, we propose online simulation of user
interactions and a custom point sampling strategy to improve robustness under
realistic prompting conditions. Our ensemble of EDT-based models, trained with
and without external data, achieves the strongest cross-validation performance,
reducing both false positives and false negatives compared to baseline models.
These results highlight the potential of promptable models to enable efficient,
user-guided segmentation workflows in multi-tracer, multi-center PET/CT. Code

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于几何映射和概率投影机制的新方法，用于从相机图像构建高精地图，通过置信度评分优化映射精度并过滤无关元素，在nuScenes和Argoverse2数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高精地图构建方法使用基于注意力的标准映射技术，存在泛化问题导致精度不足，经常产生不存在的道路元素幻觉。需要更准确的图像空间到BEV空间的映射方法来提高地图质量。

Method: 提出新颖的概率投影机制：1）基于相机参数的几何映射作为起点；2）使用置信度评分来细化映射使其与场景更好对齐；3）过滤不影响高精地图生成的无关元素；4）利用置信度评分进行选择性时间信息累积。

Result: 在nuScenes和Argoverse2数据集的新划分上实验表明，性能优于最先进方法，显示出更好的泛化能力。在nuScenes数据集和具有挑战性的长感知范围场景中改进尤为显著。

Conclusion: 该方法通过概率投影机制和置信度评分有效解决了现有方法的泛化问题，提高了高精地图构建的准确性和可靠性，特别是在复杂场景和长距离感知任务中表现突出。

Abstract: Constructing high-definition (HD) maps from sensory input requires accurately
mapping the road elements in image space to the Bird's Eye View (BEV) space.
The precision of this mapping directly impacts the quality of the final
vectorized HD map. Existing HD mapping approaches outsource the projection to
standard mapping techniques, such as attention-based ones. However, these
methods struggle with accuracy due to generalization problems, often
hallucinating non-existent road elements. Our key idea is to start with a
geometric mapping based on camera parameters and adapt it to the scene to
extract relevant map information from camera images. To implement this, we
propose a novel probabilistic projection mechanism with confidence scores to
(i) refine the mapping to better align with the scene and (ii) filter out
irrelevant elements that should not influence HD map generation. In addition,
we improve temporal processing by using confidence scores to selectively
accumulate reliable information over time. Experiments on new splits of the
nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate improved performance over
state-of-the-art approaches, indicating better generalization. The improvements
are particularly pronounced on nuScenes and in the challenging long perception
range. Our code and model checkpoints are available at

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了从单词级到行级OCR的转变，突破了单词分割的缺陷，通过更大的句子上下文提高了识别准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单词级OCR存在单词分割错误问题，且无法充分利用语言模型的上下文信息，需要找到更好的解决方案。

Method: 提出行级OCR方法，直接将整行文本作为输入，跳过单词分割步骤，利用更大的句子上下文来提高识别准确性。

Result: 实验结果显示端到端准确性提高5.4%，效率提高4倍，同时创建了包含251个英语页面图像的行级注释数据集。

Conclusion: 行级OCR是一种更有效的方案，能够更好地利用语言模型，尤其在文档图像处理中具有显著优势，为未来大语言模型的应用打下基础。

Abstract: Conventional optical character recognition (OCR) techniques segmented each
character and then recognized. This made them prone to error in character
segmentation, and devoid of context to exploit language models. Advances in
sequence to sequence translation in last decade led to modern techniques first
detecting words and then inputting one word at a time to a model to directly
output full words as sequence of characters. This allowed better utilization of
language models and bypass error-prone character segmentation step. We observe
that the above transition in style has moved the bottleneck in accuracy to word
segmentation. Hence, in this paper, we propose a natural and logical
progression from word level OCR to line-level OCR. The proposal allows to
bypass errors in word detection, and provides larger sentence context for
better utilization of language models. We show that the proposed technique not
only improves the accuracy but also efficiency of OCR. Despite our thorough
literature survey, we did not find any public dataset to train and benchmark
such shift from word to line-level OCR. Hence, we also contribute a
meticulously curated dataset of 251 English page images with line-level
annotations. Our experimentation revealed a notable end-to-end accuracy
improvement of 5.4%, underscoring the potential benefits of transitioning
towards line-level OCR, especially for document images. We also report a 4
times improvement in efficiency compared to word-based pipelines. With
continuous improvements in large language models, our methodology also holds
potential to exploit such advances. Project Website:

Motivation: 解决现有扩散模型数据增强方法计算资源需求高、需要企业级GPU和数千张合成图像的问题

Method: 使用Flux 1.1 Dev扩散模型，通过低秩适应(LoRA)进行微调，构建轻量级合成数据生成流程

Result: 在7个目标检测数据集上，仅用500张合成图像就比ODGEN基线5000张图像性能提升21.3% mAP@.50:.95

Conclusion: FLORA证明了质量优先的效率方法比暴力生成更有效，使先进合成数据生成更加实用和易于获取

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have demonstrated
significant potential in augmenting scarce datasets for object detection tasks.
Nevertheless, most recent models rely on resource-intensive full fine-tuning of
large-scale diffusion models, requiring enterprise-grade GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA
V100) and thousands of synthetic images. To address these limitations, we
propose Flux LoRA Augmentation (FLORA), a lightweight synthetic data generation
pipeline. Our approach uses the Flux 1.1 Dev diffusion model, fine-tuned
exclusively through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). This dramatically reduces
computational requirements, enabling synthetic dataset generation with a
consumer-grade GPU (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 4090). We empirically evaluate our
approach on seven diverse object detection datasets. Our results demonstrate
that training object detectors with just 500 synthetic images generated by our
approach yields superior detection performance compared to models trained on
5000 synthetic images from the ODGEN baseline, achieving improvements of up to
21.3% in mAP@.50:.95. This work demonstrates that it is possible to surpass
state-of-the-art performance with far greater efficiency, as FLORA achieves
superior results using only 10% of the data and a fraction of the computational
cost. This work demonstrates that a quality and efficiency-focused approach is
more effective than brute-force generation, making advanced synthetic data
creation more practical and accessible for real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 大型视觉-语言模型在实际场景中阅读数字测量设备值时遇到困难，特别是在杂乱、遮挡、极端视角和运动模糊等具有挑战性的条件下。

Method: 开发CAD2DMD-SET合成数据生成工具，利用3D CAD模型、高级渲染技术和高保真图像合成来生成多样化的VQA标签合成数据集，同时提供DMDBench真实图像验证集。

Conclusion: CAD2DMD-SET训练数据集能够实质性提升LVLMs在具有挑战性条件下的稳健性和性能，工具将作为开源项目释放。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities across various multimodal tasks. They continue,
however, to struggle with trivial scenarios such as reading values from Digital
Measurement Devices (DMDs), particularly in real-world conditions involving
clutter, occlusions, extreme viewpoints, and motion blur; common in
head-mounted cameras and Augmented Reality (AR) applications. Motivated by
these limitations, this work introduces CAD2DMD-SET, a synthetic data
generation tool designed to support visual question answering (VQA) tasks
involving DMDs. By leveraging 3D CAD models, advanced rendering, and
high-fidelity image composition, our tool produces diverse, VQA-labelled
synthetic DMD datasets suitable for fine-tuning LVLMs. Additionally, we present
DMDBench, a curated validation set of 1,000 annotated real-world images
designed to evaluate model performance under practical constraints.
Benchmarking three state-of-the-art LVLMs using Average Normalised Levenshtein
Similarity (ANLS) and further fine-tuning LoRA's of these models with
CAD2DMD-SET's generated dataset yielded substantial improvements, with InternVL
showcasing a score increase of 200% without degrading on other tasks. This
demonstrates that the CAD2DMD-SET training dataset substantially improves the
robustness and performance of LVLMs when operating under the previously stated
challenging conditions. The CAD2DMD-SET tool is expected to be released as
open-source once the final version of this manuscript is prepared, allowing the
community to add different measurement devices and generate their own datasets.

Abstract: Visual sound source localization is a fundamental perception task that aims
to detect the location of sounding sources in a video given its audio. Despite
recent progress, we identify two shortcomings in current methods: 1) most
approaches perform poorly in cases with low audio-visual semantic
correspondence such as silence, noise, and offscreen sounds, i.e. in the
presence of negative audio; and 2) most prior evaluations are limited to
positive cases, where both datasets and metrics convey scenarios with a single
visible sound source in the scene. To address this, we introduce three key
contributions. First, we propose a new training strategy that incorporates
silence and noise, which improves performance in positive cases, while being
more robust against negative sounds. Our resulting self-supervised model,
SSL-SaN, achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other
self-supervised models, both in sound localization and cross-modal retrieval.
Second, we propose a new metric that quantifies the trade-off between alignment
and separability of auditory and visual features across positive and negative
audio-visual pairs. Third, we present IS3+, an extended and improved version of
the IS3 synthetic dataset with negative audio.

Abstract: GUI agent aims to enable automated operations on Mobile/PC devices, which is
an important task toward achieving artificial general intelligence. The rapid
advancement of VLMs accelerates the development of GUI agents, owing to their
powerful capabilities in visual understanding and task planning. However,
building a GUI agent remains a challenging task due to the scarcity of
operation trajectories, the availability of interactive infrastructure, and the
limitation of initial capabilities in foundation models. In this work, we
introduce UItron, an open-source foundational model for automatic GUI agents,
featuring advanced GUI perception, grounding, and planning capabilities. UItron
highlights the necessity of systemic data engineering and interactive
infrastructure as foundational components for advancing GUI agent development.
It not only systematically studies a series of data engineering strategies to
enhance training effects, but also establishes an interactive environment
connecting both Mobile and PC devices. In training, UItron adopts supervised
finetuning over perception and planning tasks in various GUI scenarios, and
then develop a curriculum reinforcement learning framework to enable complex
reasoning and exploration for online environments. As a result, UItron achieves
superior performance in benchmarks of GUI perception, grounding, and planning.
In particular, UItron highlights the interaction proficiency with top-tier
Chinese mobile APPs, as we identified a general lack of Chinese capabilities
even in state-of-the-art solutions. To this end, we manually collect over one
million steps of operation trajectories across the top 100 most popular apps,
and build the offline and online agent evaluation environments. Experimental
results demonstrate that UItron achieves significant progress in Chinese app
scenarios, propelling GUI agents one step closer to real-world application.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前领域泛化评估对基础模型如CLIP可能不够挑战性，因为其预训练数据可能已覆盖现有基准。需要更好地评估CLIP在真实未见数据场景下的表现

Method: 提出CLIP-DCA方法：1）使用单独领域头识别和增强CLIP编码器中的领域感知；2）通过合成生成多样化领域数据；3）鼓励从领域特征中解耦实现领域不变分类

Conclusion: 增强领域感知是基础模型实现有效领域不变分类的前提，CLIP-DCA通过解耦方法成功提升了领域泛化性能

Abstract: Evaluating domain generalization (DG) for foundational models like CLIP is
challenging, as web-scale pretraining data potentially covers many existing
benchmarks. Consequently, current DG evaluation may neither be sufficiently
challenging nor adequately test genuinely unseen data scenarios. To better
assess the performance of CLIP on DG in-the-wild, a scenario where CLIP
encounters challenging unseen data, we consider two approaches: (1) evaluating
on 33 diverse datasets with quantified out-of-distribution (OOD) scores after
fine-tuning CLIP on ImageNet, and (2) using unlearning to make CLIP `forget'
some domains as an approximation. We observe that CLIP's performance
deteriorates significantly on more OOD datasets. To address this, we present
CLIP-DCA (Disentangling Classification from enhanced domain Aware
representations). Our approach is motivated by the observation that while
standard domain invariance losses aim to make representations domain-invariant,
this can be harmful to foundation models by forcing the discarding of
domain-aware representations beneficial for generalization. We instead
hypothesize that enhancing domain awareness is a prerequisite for effective
domain-invariant classification in foundation models. CLIP-DCA identifies and
enhances domain awareness within CLIP's encoders using a separate domain head
and synthetically generated diverse domain data. Simultaneously, it encourages

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在视频学习中引入非典型异常数据对开放世界学习的益处，发现即使简单的学习方法也能在OOD检测、新类别发现和零样本动作识别等任务中带来性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类在开放世界中展示出卓越的泛化和发现能力，而现有研究主要关注封闭集中的典型数据。论文旨在探索非典型异常视频数据如何促进开放世界学习。

Method: 收集包含各种非典型视频数据的新数据集，将其用于模型训练过程进行表示学习，重点关注OOD检测、新类别发现和零样本动作识别三个关键任务。

Result: 实验表明，使用非典型数据能一致提升各任务性能：增加类别多样性可提升OOD检测性能；使用更小但语义更多样的非典型样本集在新类别发现任务中表现更好；非典型视频的语义多样性有助于零样本动作识别任务中更好地泛化到未见动作类别。

Conclusion: 非典型视频对开放世界视觉表示学习具有显著益处，新提出的数据集和发现鼓励该方向的进一步研究。

Abstract: Humans usually show exceptional generalisation and discovery ability in the
open world, when being shown uncommon new concepts. Whereas most existing
studies in the literature focus on common typical data from closed sets,
open-world novel discovery is under-explored in videos. In this paper, we are
interested in asking: \textit{What if atypical unusual videos are exposed in
the learning process?} To this end, we collect a new video dataset consisting
of various types of unusual atypical data (\eg sci-fi, animation, \etc). To
study how such atypical data may benefit open-world learning, we feed them into
the model training process for representation learning. Focusing on three key
tasks in open-world learning: out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, novel
category discovery (NCD), and zero-shot action recognition (ZSAR), we found
that even straightforward learning approaches with atypical data consistently
improve performance across various settings. Furthermore, we found that
increasing the categorical diversity of the atypical samples further boosts OOD
detection performance. Additionally, in the NCD task, using a smaller yet more
semantically diverse set of atypical samples leads to better performance
compared to using a larger but more typical dataset. In the ZSAR setting, the
semantic diversity of atypical videos helps the model generalise better to
unseen action classes. These observations in our extensive experimental
evaluations reveal the benefits of atypical videos for visual representation
learning in the open world, together with the newly proposed dataset,
encouraging further studies in this direction.

*Nattapong Kurpukdee,Adrian G. Bors*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种无监督视频持续学习(uVCL)方法，通过核密度估计和新颖检测来处理无标签、无任务边界的视频学习问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频数据复杂且富有时空信息，但现有的持续学习研究主要集中在有监督学习上，而标签数据成本高且不实用。uVCL面临更大的计算和内存挑战。

Method: 使用无监督视频transformer网络提取深度嵌入特征，采用核密度估计(KDE)作为非参数概率表示，通过新颖检测来动态扩展内存集群以捕捉新知识。

Result: 在UCF101、HMDB51和Something-to-Something V2三个标准视频数据集上进行深度评估，无需使用标签或类别边界，该方法显著提升了多个任务持续学习的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为无监督视频持续学习领域提供了一个重要的方法案和基准协议，通过非参数方法有效处理了视频数据的复杂性和持续学习的挑战。

Abstract: We propose a realistic scenario for the unsupervised video learning where
neither task boundaries nor labels are provided when learning a succession of
tasks. We also provide a non-parametric learning solution for the
under-explored problem of unsupervised video continual learning. Videos
represent a complex and rich spatio-temporal media information, widely used in
many applications, but which have not been sufficiently explored in
unsupervised continual learning. Prior studies have only focused on supervised
continual learning, relying on the knowledge of labels and task boundaries,
while having labeled data is costly and not practical. To address this gap, we
study the unsupervised video continual learning (uVCL). uVCL raises more
challenges due to the additional computational and memory requirements of
processing videos when compared to images. We introduce a general benchmark
experimental protocol for uVCL by considering the learning of unstructured
video data categories during each task. We propose to use the Kernel Density
Estimation (KDE) of deep embedded video features extracted by unsupervised
video transformer networks as a non-parametric probabilistic representation of
the data. We introduce a novelty detection criterion for the incoming new task
data, dynamically enabling the expansion of memory clusters, aiming to capture
new knowledge when learning a succession of tasks. We leverage the use of
transfer learning from the previous tasks as an initial state for the knowledge
transfer to the current learning task. We found that the proposed methodology
substantially enhances the performance of the model when successively learning
many tasks. We perform in-depth evaluations on three standard video action
recognition datasets, including UCF101, HMDB51, and Something-to-Something V2,
without using any labels or class boundaries.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于nnU-Net框架，采用多阶段级联预训练策略，通过数据增强方案和训练调度的系统评估，构建定制化异构集成模型，在胰腺导管腺癌MRI分割任务中取得优异性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺导管腺癌(PDAC)的MRI自动分割对临床工作流程至关重要，但受到肿瘤-组织对比度差和标注数据稀缺的限制

Method: 使用nnU-Net框架，采用深度多阶段级联预训练策略：从通用解剖基础模型开始，依次在CT胰腺病变数据集和目标MRI模态上进行微调。通过五折交叉验证系统评估数据增强方案和训练调度，构建定制化异构集成模型

Result: Task 1获得0.661的顶级交叉验证肿瘤Dice分数，Task 2获得0.523的分数。Task 1实现了最先进的MASD 5.46 mm和HD95 17.33 mm边界精度

Conclusion: 提出了一种在有限数据和复杂医学成像任务背景下开发专业化高性能模型的稳健方法，通过度量感知集成策略证明高度有效

Abstract: Automated segmentation of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) from MRI is
critical for clinical workflows but is hindered by poor tumor-tissue contrast
and a scarcity of annotated data. This paper details our submission to the
PANTHER challenge, addressing both diagnostic T1-weighted (Task 1) and
therapeutic T2-weighted (Task 2) segmentation. Our approach is built upon the
nnU-Net framework and leverages a deep, multi-stage cascaded pre-training
strategy, starting from a general anatomical foundation model and sequentially
fine-tuning on CT pancreatic lesion datasets and the target MRI modalities.
Through extensive five-fold cross-validation, we systematically evaluated data
augmentation schemes and training schedules. Our analysis revealed a critical
trade-off, where aggressive data augmentation produced the highest volumetric
accuracy, while default augmentations yielded superior boundary precision
(achieving a state-of-the-art MASD of 5.46 mm and HD95 of 17.33 mm for Task 1).
For our final submission, we exploited this finding by constructing custom,
heterogeneous ensembles of specialist models, essentially creating a mix of
experts. This metric-aware ensembling strategy proved highly effective,
achieving a top cross-validation Tumor Dice score of 0.661 for Task 1 and 0.523
for Task 2. Our work presents a robust methodology for developing specialized,
high-performance models in the context of limited data and complex medical
imaging tasks (Team MIC-DKFZ).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPT-5在放射肿瘤学领域表现出色，在多项选择题测试中准确率达到92.8%，显著优于GPT-4和GPT-3.5，但在真实临床场景中仍需专家监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估GPT-5这一专门针对肿瘤学设计的大型语言模型在临床决策支持中的表现，特别是在放射肿瘤学领域的应用潜力。

Method: 使用两个基准测试：300道多项选择题的ACR放射肿瘤学培训考试和60个真实放射肿瘤学病例。四位认证放射肿瘤学家评估治疗建议的正确性、全面性和幻觉情况。

Result: GPT-5在多项选择题测试中准确率92.8%，显著优于GPT-4(78.8%)和GPT-3.5(62.1%)。在病例评估中，正确性评分3.24/4，全面性评分3.59/4，幻觉罕见但存在实质性错误。

Conclusion: GPT-5在放射肿瘤学领域表现优异，但生成的临床建议仍需专家严格监督，特别是在复杂场景和精确试验知识方面仍需改进。

Abstract: Introduction: Large language models (LLM) have shown great potential in
clinical decision support. GPT-5 is a novel LLM system that has been
specifically marketed towards oncology use.
  Methods: Performance was assessed using two complementary benchmarks: (i) the
ACR Radiation Oncology In-Training Examination (TXIT, 2021), comprising 300
multiple-choice items, and (ii) a curated set of 60 authentic radiation
oncologic vignettes representing diverse disease sites and treatment
indications. For the vignette evaluation, GPT-5 was instructed to generate
concise therapeutic plans. Four board-certified radiation oncologists rated
correctness, comprehensiveness, and hallucinations. Inter-rater reliability was
quantified using Fleiss' \k{appa}.
  Results: On the TXIT benchmark, GPT-5 achieved a mean accuracy of 92.8%,
outperforming GPT-4 (78.8%) and GPT-3.5 (62.1%). Domain-specific gains were
most pronounced in Dose and Diagnosis. In the vignette evaluation, GPT-5's
treatment recommendations were rated highly for correctness (mean 3.24/4, 95%
CI: 3.11-3.38) and comprehensiveness (3.59/4, 95% CI: 3.49-3.69).
Hallucinations were rare with no case reaching majority consensus for their
presence. Inter-rater agreement was low (Fleiss' \k{appa} 0.083 for
correctness), reflecting inherent variability in clinical judgment. Errors
clustered in complex scenarios requiring precise trial knowledge or detailed
clinical adaptation.
  Discussion: GPT-5 clearly outperformed prior model variants on the radiation
oncology multiple-choice benchmark. Although GPT-5 exhibited favorable
performance in generating real-world radiation oncology treatment
recommendations, correctness ratings indicate room for further improvement.
While hallucinations were infrequent, the presence of substantive errors
underscores that GPT-5-generated recommendations require rigorous expert
oversight before clinical implementation.

TL;DR: TMUAD是一个三记忆库框架，通过文本记忆库、对象级图像记忆库和补丁级记忆库的统一协作，实现了结构和逻辑异常检测的SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有异常检测方法主要依赖精心设计的图像特征提取器和记忆库来捕捉对象间的逻辑关系，但在逻辑异常检测方面存在局限，且正常数据量有限

Method: 提出三记忆库框架：1) 类级文本记忆库用于逻辑异常检测，通过逻辑感知文本提取器获取对象逻辑描述；2) 对象级图像记忆库保持完整对象轮廓；3) 补丁级记忆库用于结构异常检测。通过多级检索比较和分数融合实现统一检测

Result: 在7个公开数据集（工业和医疗领域）上实现了最先进的性能

Conclusion: 通过协作记忆库统一结构和逻辑异常检测是有效的，TMUAD框架在多个领域展现出优异性能

Abstract: Anomaly detection, which aims to identify anomalies deviating from normal
patterns, is challenging due to the limited amount of normal data available.
Unlike most existing unified methods that rely on carefully designed image
feature extractors and memory banks to capture logical relationships between
objects, we introduce a text memory bank to enhance the detection of logical
anomalies. Specifically, we propose a Three-Memory framework for Unified
structural and logical Anomaly Detection (TMUAD). First, we build a class-level
text memory bank for logical anomaly detection by the proposed logic-aware text
extractor, which can capture rich logical descriptions of objects from input
images. Second, we construct an object-level image memory bank that preserves
complete object contours by extracting features from segmented objects. Third,
we employ visual encoders to extract patch-level image features for
constructing a patch-level memory bank for structural anomaly detection. These
three complementary memory banks are used to retrieve and compare normal images
that are most similar to the query image, compute anomaly scores at multiple
levels, and fuse them into a final anomaly score. By unifying structural and
logical anomaly detection through collaborative memory banks, TMUAD achieves
state-of-the-art performance across seven publicly available datasets involving
industrial and medical domains. The model and code are available at
https://github.com/SIA-IDE/TMUAD.

TL;DR: VoCap是一个灵活的视频模型，能够处理视频和多种模态提示（文本、框或掩码），生成时空掩码和对应的物体中心描述。该模型同时解决了可提示视频物体分割、参考表达分割和物体描述任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频理解需要细粒度定位掩码和详细语义属性，但获取此类数据既繁琐又昂贵。为了解决这个问题，研究者希望开发一个能够同时处理多种视频理解任务的统一模型。

Method: 提出VoCap模型，通过在现有大规模分割数据集（SAV）上使用伪物体描述进行标注。使用真实掩码预处理视频以突出感兴趣物体，然后输入大型视觉语言模型生成描述。收集手动标注进行无偏评估，创建SAV-Caption数据集。

Result: VoCap在参考表达视频物体分割任务上达到最先进结果，在半监督视频物体分割上具有竞争力，并为视频物体描述建立了基准。

Conclusion: VoCap是一个有效的多任务视频理解模型，通过创新的伪标注方法解决了数据稀缺问题，在多个视频理解任务上表现出色。

Abstract: Understanding objects in videos in terms of fine-grained localization masks
and detailed semantic properties is a fundamental task in video understanding.
In this paper, we propose VoCap, a flexible video model that consumes a video
and a prompt of various modalities (text, box or mask), and produces a
spatio-temporal masklet with a corresponding object-centric caption. As such
our model addresses simultaneously the tasks of promptable video object
segmentation, referring expression segmentation, and object captioning. Since
obtaining data for this task is tedious and expensive, we propose to annotate
an existing large-scale segmentation dataset (SAV) with pseudo object captions.
We do so by preprocessing videos with their ground-truth masks to highlight the
object of interest and feed this to a large Vision Language Model (VLM). For an
unbiased evaluation, we collect manual annotations on the validation set. We
call the resulting dataset SAV-Caption. We train our VoCap model at scale on a
SAV-Caption together with a mix of other image and video datasets. Our model
yields state-of-the-art results on referring expression video object
segmentation, is competitive on semi-supervised video object segmentation, and
establishes a benchmark for video object captioning. Our dataset will be made
available at https://github.com/google-deepmind/vocap.

TL;DR: 本文揭示了场景识别中动词分类本质上是多标签问题，提出了单正例多标签学习框架和GE-VerbMLP模型，在保持传统指标竞争力的同时实现了3%以上的MAP提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将动词分类视为单标签问题，但视觉事件识别存在固有歧义性，同一图像可能被多个动词类别合理描述，需要重新审视这一设定。

Method: 将动词分类重新定义为单正例多标签学习问题，提出Graph Enhanced Verb Multilayer Perceptron模型，结合图神经网络捕捉标签相关性和对抗训练优化决策边界。

Result: 在真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在保持top-1和top-5准确率竞争力的同时，实现了超过3%的平均精度均值提升。

Conclusion: 动词分类本质上是多标签问题，提出的SPMLL框架和GE-VerbMLP模型有效解决了视觉事件识别中的语义重叠问题，为场景识别任务提供了新的评估基准和方法论。

Abstract: Context recognition (SR) is a fundamental task in computer vision that aims
to extract structured semantic summaries from images by identifying key events
and their associated entities. Specifically, given an input image, the model
must first classify the main visual events (verb classification), then identify
the participating entities and their semantic roles (semantic role labeling),
and finally localize these entities in the image (semantic role localization).
Existing methods treat verb classification as a single-label problem, but we
show through a comprehensive analysis that this formulation fails to address
the inherent ambiguity in visual event recognition, as multiple verb categories
may reasonably describe the same image. This paper makes three key
contributions: First, we reveal through empirical analysis that verb
classification is inherently a multi-label problem due to the ubiquitous
semantic overlap between verb categories. Second, given the impracticality of
fully annotating large-scale datasets with multiple labels, we propose to
reformulate verb classification as a single positive multi-label learning
(SPMLL) problem - a novel perspective in SR research. Third, we design a
comprehensive multi-label evaluation benchmark for SR that is carefully
designed to fairly evaluate model performance in a multi-label setting. To
address the challenges of SPMLL, we futher develop the Graph Enhanced Verb
Multilayer Perceptron (GE-VerbMLP), which combines graph neural networks to
capture label correlations and adversarial training to optimize decision
boundaries. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our approach
achieves more than 3\% MAP improvement while remaining competitive on
traditional top-1 and top-5 accuracy metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动驾驶基准测试主要关注空间和视觉问答任务，但缺乏对完整交通规则、标志识别和路权原则的全面评估，需要测试模型在罕见边缘案例中的表现。

Method: 开发了DriveQA基准测试，包含文本和视觉模态，通过控制环境因素变化（光照、视角、距离、天气）来评估模型敏感性，并进行微调实验。

Result: SOTA模型在基本交通规则上表现良好，但在数值推理、复杂路权场景、交通标志变体和空间布局方面存在显著弱点；微调后准确率提升，特别是在监管标志识别和交叉口决策方面。

Conclusion: DriveQA有效评估驾驶知识，微调能显著改善模型性能，预训练可提升下游驾驶任务表现，模型能够内化文本和合成交通知识来泛化到下游QA任务。

Abstract: If a Large Language Model (LLM) were to take a driving knowledge test today,
would it pass? Beyond standard spatial and visual question-answering (QA) tasks
on current autonomous driving benchmarks, driving knowledge tests require a
complete understanding of all traffic rules, signage, and right-of-way
principles. To pass this test, human drivers must discern various edge cases
that rarely appear in real-world datasets. In this work, we present DriveQA, an
extensive open-source text and vision-based benchmark that exhaustively covers
traffic regulations and scenarios. Through our experiments using DriveQA, we
show that (1) state-of-the-art LLMs and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) perform well on
basic traffic rules but exhibit significant weaknesses in numerical reasoning
and complex right-of-way scenarios, traffic sign variations, and spatial
layouts, (2) fine-tuning on DriveQA improves accuracy across multiple
categories, particularly in regulatory sign recognition and intersection
decision-making, (3) controlled variations in DriveQA-V provide insights into
model sensitivity to environmental factors such as lighting, perspective,
distance, and weather conditions, and (4) pretraining on DriveQA enhances
downstream driving task performance, leading to improved results on real-world
datasets such as nuScenes and BDD, while also demonstrating that models can
internalize text and synthetic traffic knowledge to generalize effectively
across downstream QA tasks.

Motivation: 为了解决胸部X光片肺病严重程度分类中标注数据需求量大和类别不平衡的问题，减少对大量标注数据的依赖。

Method: 采用带有蒙特卡洛Dropout的深度神经网络，结合主动学习策略，使用不同的采集函数迭代选择信息量最大的样本，并应用加权损失函数处理类别不平衡。

Result: 熵采样在二分类任务中达到93.7%准确率（AU ROC 0.91），仅使用15.4%的训练数据；均值标准差采样在多分类任务中达到70.3%准确率（AU ROC 0.86），仅使用23.1%的标注数据。这些方法优于更复杂计算昂贵的采集函数。

Conclusion: 深度主动学习结合贝叶斯神经网络近似和加权损失函数能有效减少标注数据需求，同时处理类别不平衡问题，保持或超越诊断性能表现。

Abstract: To reduce the amount of required labeled data for lung disease severity
classification from chest X-rays (CXRs) under class imbalance, this study
applied deep active learning with a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) approximation
and weighted loss function. This retrospective study collected 2,319 CXRs from
963 patients (mean age, 59.2 $\pm$ 16.6 years; 481 female) at Emory Healthcare
affiliated hospitals between January and November 2020. All patients had
clinically confirmed COVID-19. Each CXR was independently labeled by 3 to 6
board-certified radiologists as normal, moderate, or severe. A deep neural
network with Monte Carlo Dropout was trained using active learning to classify
disease severity. Various acquisition functions were used to iteratively select
the most informative samples from an unlabeled pool. Performance was evaluated
using accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AU
ROC), and area under the precision-recall curve (AU PRC). Training time and
acquisition time were recorded. Statistical analysis included descriptive
metrics and performance comparisons across acquisition strategies. Entropy
Sampling achieved 93.7% accuracy (AU ROC, 0.91) in binary classification
(normal vs. diseased) using 15.4% of the training data. In the multi-class
setting, Mean STD sampling achieved 70.3% accuracy (AU ROC, 0.86) using 23.1%
of the labeled data. These methods outperformed more complex and
computationally expensive acquisition functions and significantly reduced
labeling needs. Deep active learning with BNN approximation and weighted loss
effectively reduces labeled data requirements while addressing class imbalance,
maintaining or exceeding diagnostic performance.

Abstract: Unregistered surface meshes, especially raw 3D scans, present significant
challenges for automatic computation of plausible deformations due to the lack
of established point-wise correspondences and the presence of noise in the

motion prediction and transfer on such body meshes. Our method couples a robust
motion embedding network with a learned per-vertex feature field to generate a
spatio-temporal deformation field, which drives the mesh deformation. Extensive
evaluations, including quantitative benchmarks and qualitative visuals on tasks
such as walking and running, demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of
our approach on challenging unregistered meshes.

Motivation: 现有3D高斯泼溅(3DGS)重建方法如SuGaR在视觉保真度和场景一致性方面仍有改进空间，需要解决单个高斯形状异常和整体表面连贯性问题。

Method: 1. 有效秩正则化：鼓励高斯保持平衡的盘状形状而非极端各向异性的针状形状；2. 神经SDF正则化：通过Eikonal损失保持距离属性，提供连续全局表面先验来引导高斯对齐几何结构。

Result: 通过两种互补的正则化策略，显著提升了从3DGS数据重建高质量3D网格和视觉效果的能力，实现了更准确和连贯的视觉输出。

Conclusion: 所提出的正则化方法有效解决了3D高斯泼溅中的形状异常和表面一致性问题，为高质量3D重建提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing high-quality 3D meshes and visuals from 3D Gaussian
Splatting(3DGS) still remains a central challenge in computer graphics.
Although existing models such as SuGaR offer effective solutions for rendering,
there is is still room to improve improve both visual fidelity and scene
consistency. This work builds upon SuGaR by introducing two complementary
regularization strategies that address common limitations in both the shape of
individual Gaussians and the coherence of the overall surface. The first
strategy introduces an effective rank regularization, motivated by recent
studies on Gaussian primitive structures. This regularization discourages
extreme anisotropy-specifically, "needle-like" shapes-by favoring more
balanced, "disk-like" forms that are better suited for stable surface
reconstruction. The second strategy integrates a neural Signed Distance
Function (SDF) into the optimization process. The SDF is regularized with an
Eikonal loss to maintain proper distance properties and provides a continuous
global surface prior, guiding Gaussians toward better alignment with the
underlying geometry. These two regularizations aim to improve both the fidelity
of individual Gaussian primitives and their collective surface behavior. The
final model can make more accurate and coherent visuals from 3DGS data.

Motivation: 解决视觉引导四足运动控制问题，强调结合本体感觉和视觉对于鲁棒控制的必要性，传统方法在动作抖动和能耗方面存在不足。

Method: 使用样条参数化的跨模态策略（QuadKAN），包含样条编码器处理本体感觉输入和样条融合头处理多模态输入，采用MMDR和PPO进行端到端训练。

Result: 在包括平坦/不平坦地形和静态/动态障碍物等多种场景中，QuadKAN相比SOTA基线实现了更高的回报、更远的移动距离和更少的碰撞。

Conclusion: 样条参数化策略为鲁棒的视觉引导运动控制提供了简单、有效且可解释的替代方案。

Abstract: We address vision-guided quadruped motion control with reinforcement learning
(RL) and highlight the necessity of combining proprioception with vision for
robust control. We propose QuadKAN, a spline-parameterized cross-modal policy
instantiated with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). The framework incorporates
a spline encoder for proprioception and a spline fusion head for
proprioception-vision inputs. This structured function class aligns the
state-to-action mapping with the piecewise-smooth nature of gait, improving
sample efficiency, reducing action jitter and energy consumption, and providing
interpretable posture-action sensitivities. We adopt Multi-Modal Delay
Randomization (MMDR) and perform end-to-end training with Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO). Evaluations across diverse terrains, including both even
and uneven surfaces and scenarios with static or dynamic obstacles, demonstrate
that QuadKAN achieves consistently higher returns, greater distances, and fewer
collisions than state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines. These results show that
spline-parameterized policies offer a simple, effective, and interpretable
alternative for robust vision-guided locomotion. A repository will be made

Abstract: Autonomous driving applications have become increasingly relevant in the
automotive industry due to their potential to enhance vehicle safety,
efficiency, and user experience, thereby meeting the growing demand for
sophisticated driving assistance features. However, the development of reliable
and trustworthy autonomous systems poses challenges such as high complexity,
prolonged training periods, and intrinsic levels of uncertainty. Mini
Autonomous Cars (MACs) are used as a practical testbed, enabling validation of
autonomous control methodologies on small-scale setups. This simplified and
cost-effective environment facilitates rapid evaluation and comparison of
machine learning models, which is particularly useful for algorithms requiring
online training. To address these challenges, this work presents a methodology
based on RGB-D information and three-dimensional convolutional neural networks
(3D CNNs) for MAC autonomous driving in simulated environments. We evaluate the
proposed approach against recurrent neural networks (RNNs), with architectures
trained and tested on two simulated tracks with distinct environmental
features. Performance was assessed using task completion success, lap-time
metrics, and driving consistency. Results highlight how architectural
modifications and track complexity influence the models' generalization
capability and vehicle control performance. The proposed 3D CNN demonstrated
promising results when compared with RNNs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微生物组对人体健康至关重要，但现有研究工具功能有限且需要专业知识，难以直观理解时空数据

Method: 开发基于VR的用户友好工具MicroLabVR，支持导入CSV格式的种群增长、物质浓度和代谢通量数据，在虚拟环境中进行交互式可视化分析

Result: 实现了将空间数据转换为VR环境的功能，遵循用户体验指南，允许用户在空间背景下探索微生物组数据

Conclusion: MicroLabVR为微生物组研究提供了更直观的数据分析工具，改善了时空数据的可视化和理解

Abstract: Microbiomes are a vital part of the human body, engaging in tasks like food
digestion and immune defense. Their structure and function must be understood
in order to promote host health and facilitate swift recovery during disease.
Due to the difficulties in experimentally studying these systems in situ, more
research is being conducted in the field of mathematical modeling. Visualizing
spatiotemporal data is challenging, and current tools that simulate microbial
communities' spatial and temporal development often only provide limited
functionalities, often requiring expert knowledge to generate useful results.
To overcome these limitations, we provide a user-friendly tool to interactively
explore spatiotemporal simulation data, called MicroLabVR, which transfers
spatial data into virtual reality (VR) while following guidelines to enhance
user experience (UX). With MicroLabVR, users can import CSV datasets containing
population growth, substance concentration development, and metabolic flux
distribution data. The implemented visualization methods allow users to
evaluate the dataset in a VR environment interactively. MicroLabVR aims to
improve data analysis for the user by allowing the exploration of microbiome
data in their spatial context.

TL;DR: Morae是一个UI代理系统，通过识别任务执行中的决策点并暂停让用户选择，提高盲人和低视力用户的控制权和满意度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前UI代理通常端到端执行任务，不涉及用户在关键选择中的参与，也不告知重要上下文信息，降低了用户控制权。研究发现BLV用户需要更多参与决策过程。

Method: 使用大型多模态模型解释用户查询、UI代码和截图，在需要决策时暂停并提示用户澄清选择。采用混合主动方法，结合自动化和用户偏好表达。

Result: 在真实网页任务研究中，Morae相比基线代理（包括OpenAI Operator）帮助用户完成更多任务，选择更符合偏好的选项。

Conclusion: Morae展示了混合主动方法的有效性，用户既能受益于UI代理的自动化，又能表达个人偏好，提高了BLV用户的控制权和任务完成质量。

Abstract: User interface (UI) agents promise to make inaccessible or complex UIs easier
to access for blind and low-vision (BLV) users. However, current UI agents
typically perform tasks end-to-end without involving users in critical choices
or making them aware of important contextual information, thus reducing user
agency. For example, in our field study, a BLV participant asked to buy the
cheapest available sparkling water, and the agent automatically chose one from
several equally priced options, without mentioning alternative products with
different flavors or better ratings. To address this problem, we introduce
Morae, a UI agent that automatically identifies decision points during task
execution and pauses so that users can make choices. Morae uses large
multimodal models to interpret user queries alongside UI code and screenshots,
and prompt users for clarification when there is a choice to be made. In a
study over real-world web tasks with BLV participants, Morae helped users
complete more tasks and select options that better matched their preferences,
as compared to baseline agents, including OpenAI Operator. More broadly, this
work exemplifies a mixed-initiative approach in which users benefit from the
automation of UI agents while being able to express their preferences.

TL;DR: 这篇论文探讨了如何通过项目化学习(PBL)来改善量子计算教学效果，通过让学生将HHL算法应用于CT图像重建并与经典ART算法进行对比分析，从而提升实践能力和理论理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子计算的抽象概念和非直观性质给传统讲授式教学带来挑战，需要更有效的教学方法来帮助学生理解。

Method: 采用项目化学习(PBL)方法，让学生将量子计算与其专业领域相结合，实际实施HHL算法并与经典ART算法进行性能测试对比。

Result: 学生在小规模问题上获得了量子算法的实践经验，批判性评估了其限制，并发展了技术写作和研究能力。

Conclusion: 项目化学习不仅提升概念理解，还能激励学生深入参与新兴技术研究。建议在入门量子计算课程中集成类似的PBL模块，通过跨学科实际问题将抽象理论转化为有意义的学习体验。

Abstract: Quantum computing introduces abstract concepts and non-intuitive behaviors
that can be challenging for students to grasp through traditional lecture-based
instruction alone. This paper demonstrates how Project-Based Learning (PBL) can
be leveraged to bridge that gap. This can be done by engaging students in a
real-world, interdisciplinary task that combines quantum computing with their
field of interest. As part of a similar assignment, we investigated the
application of the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm for computed
tomography (CT) image reconstruction and benchmarked its performance against
the classical Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (ART). Through implementing
and analyzing both methods on a small-scale problem, we gained practical
experience with quantum algorithms, critically evaluated their limitations, and
developed technical writing and research skills. The experience demonstrated
that Project-Based Learning not only enhances conceptual understanding but also
encourages students to engage deeply with emerging technologies through
research, implementation, and reflection. We recommend the integration of
similar PBL modules in introductory quantum computing courses. The assignment
also works better if students are required to write and submit a
conference-style paper, supported by mentorship from faculty across the
different fields. In such course interdisciplinary, real-world problems can
transform abstract theory into meaningful learning experiences and better
prepare students for future advancements in quantum technologies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了Misviz基准数据集，包含2,604个真实世界可视化图表和81,814个合成图表，用于检测误导性可视化图表及其违反的设计规则，评估显示当前MLLMs在此任务上仍面临巨大挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 误导性可视化图表是社交媒体和网络上错误信息的重要来源，违反图表设计原则会扭曲数据并导致读者得出错误结论。现有AI模型训练和评估缺乏大型、多样化、公开可用的数据集。

Method: 构建Misviz基准数据集（2,604个真实可视化图表）和Misviz-synth合成数据集（81,814个使用Matplotlib生成的图表），使用最先进的MLLMs、基于规则的系统以及微调分类器进行全面评估。

Result: 研究结果显示，检测误导性可视化图表及其违反设计规则的任务仍然极具挑战性，即使使用最先进的模型也难以有效解决。

Conclusion: 发布了Misviz和Misviz-synth数据集及相关代码，为未来研究提供了重要资源，但自动检测误导性可视化图表仍是一个未解决的难题。

Abstract: Misleading visualizations are a potent driver of misinformation on social
media and the web. By violating chart design principles, they distort data and
lead readers to draw inaccurate conclusions. Prior work has shown that both
humans and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are frequently deceived by
such visualizations. Automatically detecting misleading visualizations and
identifying the specific design rules they violate could help protect readers
and reduce the spread of misinformation. However, the training and evaluation
of AI models has been limited by the absence of large, diverse, and openly
available datasets. In this work, we introduce Misviz, a benchmark of 2,604
real-world visualizations annotated with 12 types of misleaders. To support
model training, we also release Misviz-synth, a synthetic dataset of 81,814
visualizations generated using Matplotlib and based on real-world data tables.
We perform a comprehensive evaluation on both datasets using state-of-the-art
MLLMs, rule-based systems, and fine-tuned classifiers. Our results reveal that
the task remains highly challenging. We release Misviz, Misviz-synth, and the
accompanying code.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了Percept-V数据集，包含7200张程序生成的图像，用于测试多模态大语言模型在基本视觉感知任务上的表现。实验发现即使是最先进的MLLMs在简单感知任务上表现不佳，且性能随问题复杂度增加而显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs在复杂任务（如编码、数学、科学）上表现出色，但在基本视觉感知任务上的性能评估非常有限。作者希望填补这一空白，评估MLLMs在未受污染的生成图像上进行简单感知任务的能力。

Method: 创建Percept-V数据集，包含7200张程序生成的图像，分为30个类别，每个类别测试不同的视觉感知技能组合。使用GPT-4o、Gemini、Claude等最先进的MLLMs以及OpenAI o4-mini、DeepSeek R1等大型推理模型进行测试。

Result: 实验结果显示，尽管MLLMs在复杂任务上表现出色，但在基本感知任务上表现显著下降，且性能随问题复杂度增加而降低。不同模型在不同类别上表现出相似的趋势，某些认知技能比其他技能更难。

Conclusion: MLLMs在基本视觉感知任务上存在明显缺陷，即使是最先进的模型也难以处理简单的形状和结构识别。这表明当前MLLMs的感知能力仍有待改进，需要更多关注基础视觉理解能力的提升。

Abstract: The reasoning abilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
garnered a lot of attention in recent times, with advances made in frontiers
like coding, mathematics, and science. However, very limited experiments have
been done to assess their performance in simple perception tasks performed over
uncontaminated, generated images containing basic shapes and structures. To
address this issue, the paper introduces a dataset, Percept-V, containing a
total of 7200 program-generated images equally divided into 30 categories, each
testing a combination of visual perception skills. Unlike previously proposed
datasets, Percept-V comprises very basic tasks of varying complexity that test
the perception abilities of MLLMs. This dataset is then tested on
state-of-the-art MLLMs like GPT-4o, Gemini, and Claude as well as Large
Reasoning Models (LRMs) like OpenAI o4-mini and DeepSeek R1 to gauge their
performance. Contrary to the evidence that MLLMs excel in many complex tasks,
our experiments show a significant drop in the models' performance with
increasing problem complexity across all categories. An analysis of the
performances also reveals that the tested MLLMs exhibit a similar trend in
accuracy across categories, testing a particular cognitive skill and find some
skills to be more difficult than others.

Motivation: 现有基准主要关注通用MLLM能力或模型作为求解器的评估，缺乏针对医学场景的专业评估维度（如诊断准确性和临床相关性），医学奖励模型和评判器研究不足。

Method: 构建多模态数据集，采用三步严格流程确保高质量评估数据，在六个临床关键维度上评估32个先进MLLM模型，并开发基线模型通过微调验证性能提升。

Result: 评估显示现有模型在输出与专家判断对齐方面存在显著挑战，基线模型通过微调实现了显著性能改进。

Conclusion: Med-RewardBench填补了医学奖励模型评估的空白，为医学MLLM的可靠评估提供了重要基准，证明了专业微调对提升医学AI性能的重要性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold significant potential in
medical applications, including disease diagnosis and clinical decision-making.
However, these tasks require highly accurate, context-sensitive, and
professionally aligned responses, making reliable reward models and judges
critical. Despite their importance, medical reward models (MRMs) and judges
remain underexplored, with no dedicated benchmarks addressing clinical
requirements. Existing benchmarks focus on general MLLM capabilities or
evaluate models as solvers, neglecting essential evaluation dimensions like
diagnostic accuracy and clinical relevance. To address this, we introduce
Med-RewardBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate MRMs and
judges in medical scenarios. Med-RewardBench features a multimodal dataset
spanning 13 organ systems and 8 clinical departments, with 1,026
expert-annotated cases. A rigorous three-step process ensures high-quality
evaluation data across six clinically critical dimensions. We evaluate 32
state-of-the-art MLLMs, including open-source, proprietary, and
medical-specific models, revealing substantial challenges in aligning outputs
with expert judgment. Additionally, we develop baseline models that demonstrate
substantial performance improvements through fine-tuning.

Motivation: 随着脱贫攻坚和乡村振兴战略的深入，改善农村人居环境、提升生活质量成为关键任务。现有测量方法存在局限：问卷方法难以规模化，城市导向的视觉感知方法不适用于农村场景。

Method: 采用自上而下方法收集大规模无人机影像，开发高效图像比较机制（二分搜索插值），构建基于专家知识的思维链提示，从生活质量和生态宜居性两个维度评估农村宜居性。

Result: 中国农村宜居性呈现双核-边缘空间模式（以四川和浙江为中心向外辐射递减）；政府财政支出是核心影响因素，每增加1个单位对应3.9-4.9个单位的宜居性提升。

Conclusion: 该研究为农村建设政策制定提供了有价值的见解，证明了基于无人机影像和MLLMs的农村宜居性评估框架的有效性和实用性。

Abstract: With the deepening of poverty alleviation and rural revitalization
strategies, improving the rural living environment and enhancing the quality of
life have become key priorities. Rural livability is a key indicator for
measuring the effectiveness of these efforts. Current measurement approaches
face significant limitations, as questionnaire-based methods are difficult to
scale, while urban-oriented visual perception methods are poorly suited for
rural contexts. In this paper, a rural-specific livability assessment framework
was proposed based on drone imagery and multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). To comprehensively assess village livability, this study first used a
top-down approach to collect large-scale drone imagery of 1,766 villages in 146
counties across China. In terms of the model framework, an efficient image
comparison mechanism was developed, incorporating binary search interpolation
to determine effective image pairs while reducing comparison iterations.
Building on expert knowledge, a chain-of-thought prompting suitable for
nationwide rural livability measurement was constructed, considering both
living quality and ecological habitability dimensions. This approach enhanced
the rationality and reliability of the livability assessment. Finally, this
study characterized the spatial heterogeneity of rural livability across China
and thoroughly analyzed its influential factors. The results show that: (1) The
rural livability in China demonstrates a dual-core-periphery spatial pattern,
radiating outward from Sichuan and Zhejiang provinces with declining gradients;
(2) Among various influential factors, government fiscal expenditure emerged as
the core determinant, with each unit increase corresponding to a 3.9 - 4.9 unit
enhancement in livability. The findings provide valuable insights for rural
construction policy-making.

Motivation: 虽然知道磁重联网在MRTI进化中发生，但其在不稳定性进化和能量动力学中的作用仍不清楚，需要全面分析以理解其在天体物理和实验室等种影响。

Method: 使用高分辨率模拟进行二维MRTI动力学分析，开发了稳健的自动化重联网检测算法，并在不同磁场强度范围内进行统计分析。

Result: 重联网在弱磁场区域负责较大比例（80%）的磁能-动能转换，但对磁能耗散的贡献较小（约3%），通过促进管道合并、缓解磁张力和继续不稳定性增长来调控长期进化。

Conclusion: 磁重联网是调控大规模MRTI动力学的关键机制，对天体物理等平面具有重要意义。

Abstract: Magnetic Rayleigh-Taylor instability (MRTI) governs material transport and
mixing in astrophysical and laboratory plasmas under the influence of gravity
and magnetic fields. While magnetic reconnection is known to occur during MRTI
evolution, its role in the evolution and energy dynamics remains poorly
understood. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of the role of
reconnection in the two-dimensional MRTI dynamics, using high-resolution
simulations. We establish that reconnection, through facilitating plume merger,
relieving magnetic tension, and enabling continued instability growth, forms an
essential component for the long-term instability evolution. To quantify the
role of reconnection in energy dynamics, we develop a robust automated
reconnection detection algorithm and perform a statistical analysis across a
range of magnetic field strengths. We find that reconnection accounts for up to
$80\%$ of the magnetic-to-kinetic energy transfer in the weak magnetic field
regime, while contributing minimally ($\approx 3\%$) to magnetic energy
dissipation. Our results establish magnetic reconnection as a critical
mechanism that regulates large-scale MRTI dynamics, with implications for
astrophysical plasmas and turbulent mixing in magnetized flows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统编程语言翻译方法需要为每对语言开发单独的翻译器，导致复杂度呈指数级增长。为了解决这个问题，需要一种统一的中间表示来实现多语言间的双向翻译。

Method: 使用统一的中间表示CrossGL，包含语言特定的词法分析器/解析器将源代码转换为AST，双向CrossGL翻译模块实现ToCrossGLConverter类用于导入代码和CodeGen类用于目标生成，以及处理完整翻译流程的综合后端实现。

Result: 在多个编程领域进行全面评估，实现了在所有支持的后端上成功编译和执行，证明了系统的有效性。支持CUDA、HIP、Metal、DirectX HLSL、OpenGL GLSL、Vulkan SPIR-V、Rust和Mojo等多种语言。

Conclusion: CrossTL代表了向语言无关编程迈出的重要一步，实现了"一次编写，到处部署"的开发模式。统一的IR设计使得添加新语言只需最少的努力，只需要语言特定的前端/后端组件。

Abstract: We present CrossTL, a universal programming language translator enabling
bidirectional translation between multiple languages through a unified
intermediate representation called CrossGL. Traditional approaches require
separate translators for each language pair, leading to exponential complexity
growth. CrossTL uses a single universal IR to facilitate translations between
CUDA, HIP, Metal, DirectX HLSL, OpenGL GLSL, Vulkan SPIR-V, Rust, and Mojo,
with Slang support in development. Our system consists of: language-specific
lexers/parsers converting source code to ASTs, bidirectional CrossGL
translation modules implementing ToCrossGLConverter classes for importing code
and CodeGen classes for target generation, and comprehensive backend
implementations handling full translation pipelines. We demonstrate
effectiveness through comprehensive evaluation across programming domains,
achieving successful compilation and execution across all supported backends.
The universal IR design enables adding new languages with minimal effort,
requiring only language-specific frontend/backend components. Our contributions
include: (1) a unified IR capturing semantics of multiple programming
paradigms, (2) a modular architecture enabling extensibility, (3) a
comprehensive framework supporting GPU compute, graphics programming, and
systems languages, and (4) empirical validation demonstrating practical
viability of universal code translation. CrossTL represents a significant step
toward language-agnostic programming, enabling write-once, deploy-everywhere
development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保深度学习模型在真实应用中的可靠性，需要有效区分训练分布内(ID)和分布外(OOD)样本，特别是在不同分布偏移程度下的检测需求

Method: 使用奇异值分解分类头权重矩阵，将模型激活分解为决定性分量（对分类输出贡献最大）和无关分量（贡献最小）。在远分布偏移时利用无关分量，在近分布偏移时利用决定性分量

Result: 在各种标准OOD基准测试中取得了最先进的结果

Conclusion: ActSub方法通过合理利用激活的不同分量，有效解决了不同分布偏移程度下的OOD检测问题，提升了检测性能

Abstract: To ensure the reliability of deep models in real-world applications,
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods aim to distinguish samples close to
the training distribution (in-distribution, ID) from those farther away (OOD).
In this work, we propose a novel OOD detection method that utilizes singular
value decomposition of the weight matrix of the classification head to
decompose the model's activations into decisive and insignificant components,
which contribute maximally, respectively minimally, to the final classifier
output. We find that the subspace of insignificant components more effectively
distinguishes ID from OOD data than raw activations in regimes of large
distribution shifts (Far-OOD). This occurs because the classification objective
leaves the insignificant subspace largely unaffected, yielding features that
are ''untainted'' by the target classification task. Conversely, in regimes of
smaller distribution shifts (Near-OOD), we find that activation shaping methods
profit from only considering the decisive subspace, as the insignificant
component can cause interference in the activation space. By combining two
findings into a single approach, termed ActSub, we achieve state-of-the-art
results in various standard OOD benchmarks.

Motivation: 解决心率预测在实际部署中遇到的数据异质性问题，包括来自不同设备的源异质性和不同用户生理特征的用户异质性。

Method: 提出了一个框架，使用随机特征丢弃策略处理源异质性，采用时间感知注意力模块和对比学习目标来处理用户异质性，学习不受异质性影响的潜表示。

Result: 在ParroTao和FitRec数据集上，模型表现明显超过现有基线方法，分别提升17%和15%，学到的表示具有强大的辨别能力。

Conclusion: 该框架有效地处理了心率预测中的数据异质性问题，为实际部署提供了可靠的解决方案，并且创建了新的标准数据集ParroTao来反映实际数据的异质性特征。

Abstract: Heart rate prediction is vital for personalized health monitoring and
fitness, while it frequently faces a critical challenge when deploying in
real-world: data heterogeneity. We classify it in two key dimensions: source
heterogeneity from fragmented device markets with varying feature sets, and
user heterogeneity reflecting distinct physiological patterns across
individuals and activities. Existing methods either discard device-specific
information, or fail to model user-specific differences, limiting their
real-world performance. To address this, we propose a framework that learns
latent representations agnostic to both heterogeneity, enabling downstream
predictors to work consistently under heterogeneous data patterns.
Specifically, we introduce a random feature dropout strategy to handle source
heterogeneity, making the model robust to various feature sets. To manage user
heterogeneity, we employ a time-aware attention module to capture long-term
physiological traits and use a contrastive learning objective to build a
discriminative representation space. To reflect the heterogeneous nature of
real-world data, we created and publicly released a new benchmark dataset,
ParroTao. Evaluations on both ParroTao and the public FitRec dataset show that
our model significantly outperforms existing baselines by 17% and 15%,
respectively. Furthermore, analysis of the learned representations demonstrates
their strong discriminative power, and one downstream application task confirm
the practical value of our model.
