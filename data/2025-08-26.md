### [1] [Towards High-Precision Depth Sensing via Monocular-Aided iToF and RGB Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16579)
*Yansong Du,Yutong Deng,Yuting Zhou,Feiyu Jiao,Jian Song,Xun Guan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的iToF-RGB融合框架，通过几何校准和双编码器网络解决iToF深度感知的低分辨率、窄视场和结构失真问题，实现深度超分辨率和视场扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 间接飞行时间(iToF)深度传感存在空间分辨率低、视场角有限以及在复杂场景中出现结构失真等固有局限性，需要与RGB图像融合来提升性能。

Method: 首先通过精确的几何校准模块将窄视场iToF深度图重投影到宽视场RGB坐标系，确保模态间像素级对应；然后使用双编码器融合网络联合提取iToF深度和RGB图像的互补特征，并利用单目深度先验恢复精细结构细节和进行深度超分辨率。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法在准确性、结构一致性和视觉质量方面显著优于最先进的方法，实现了增强的深度精度、改进的边缘锐度和无缝的视场扩展。

Conclusion: 该iToF-RGB融合框架通过跨模态结构线索和深度一致性约束的有效整合，成功解决了iToF深度感知的关键限制，为多模态深度感知提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel iToF-RGB fusion framework designed to address the
inherent limitations of indirect Time-of-Flight (iToF) depth sensing, such as
low spatial resolution, limited field-of-view (FoV), and structural distortion
in complex scenes. The proposed method first reprojects the narrow-FoV iToF
depth map onto the wide-FoV RGB coordinate system through a precise geometric
calibration and alignment module, ensuring pixel-level correspondence between
modalities. A dual-encoder fusion network is then employed to jointly extract
complementary features from the reprojected iToF depth and RGB image, guided by
monocular depth priors to recover fine-grained structural details and perform
depth super-resolution. By integrating cross-modal structural cues and depth
consistency constraints, our approach achieves enhanced depth accuracy,
improved edge sharpness, and seamless FoV expansion. Extensive experiments on
both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy,
structural consistency, and visual quality.

### [2] [CountLoop: Training-Free High-Instance Image Generation via Iterative Agent Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16644)
*Anindya Mondal,Ayan Banerjee,Sauradip Nag,Josep Lladós,Xiatian Zhu,Anjan Dutta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CountLoop是一个无需训练的训练框架，通过迭代结构化反馈为扩散模型提供精确的实例控制，在复杂高密度场景中实现高达98%的计数准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在逼真图像合成方面表现出色，但在生成具有精确对象实例数量的场景时仍然不可靠，特别是在复杂和高密度设置中。

Method: 采用迭代结构化反馈方法，在图像生成和多模态代理评估之间交替进行，包括语言引导的规划器和批评器评估对象计数、空间布局和属性一致性，并引入实例驱动的注意力掩码和组合生成技术。

Result: 在COCO Count、T2I CompBench和两个新的高实例基准测试中，CountLoop实现了高达98%的计数准确率，同时保持空间保真度和视觉质量，以0.97的分数优于基于布局和梯度引导的基线方法。

Conclusion: CountLoop通过训练免费的迭代反馈机制有效解决了扩散模型在精确实例控制方面的局限性，为复杂场景生成提供了可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable progress in photorealistic image
synthesis, yet they remain unreliable for generating scenes with a precise
number of object instances, particularly in complex and high-density settings.
We present CountLoop, a training-free framework that provides diffusion models
with accurate instance control through iterative structured feedback. The
approach alternates between image generation and multimodal agent evaluation,
where a language-guided planner and critic assess object counts, spatial
arrangements, and attribute consistency. This feedback is then used to refine
layouts and guide subsequent generations. To further improve separation between
objects, especially in occluded scenes, we introduce instance-driven attention
masking and compositional generation techniques. Experiments on COCO Count, T2I
CompBench, and two new high-instance benchmarks show that CountLoop achieves
counting accuracy of up to 98% while maintaining spatial fidelity and visual
quality, outperforming layout-based and gradient-guided baselines with a score
of 0.97.

### [3] [Do VLMs Have Bad Eyes? Diagnosing Compositional Failures via Mechanistic Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16652)
*Ashwath Vaithinathan Aravindan,Abha Jha,Mihir Kulkarni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现CLIP视觉编码器中MLP层的神经元存在特征叠加现象，这阻碍了组合特征表示能力，导致视觉语言模型在组合推理和对象绑定方面表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在图像描述和视觉问答等任务中表现出色，但在组合泛化和对象绑定方面存在困难，需要探究其根本原因。

Method: 使用机制可解释性技术分析CLIP视觉编码器，发现MLP层中单个神经元同时表示多个特征的现象（特征叠加）。

Result: 特征叠加现象直接阻碍了组合特征表示能力，进而影响了组合推理和对象绑定性能。

Conclusion: 这项研究为揭示视觉语言模型中组合失败问题的机制根源迈出了第一步，相关代码和结果已开源。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable performance in
integrating visual and textual information for tasks such as image captioning
and visual question answering. However, these models struggle with
compositional generalization and object binding, which limit their ability to
handle novel combinations of objects and their attributes. Our work explores
the root causes of these failures using mechanistic interpretability
techniques. We show evidence that individual neurons in the MLP layers of
CLIP's vision encoder represent multiple features, and this "superposition"
directly hinders its compositional feature representation which consequently
affects compositional reasoning and object binding capabilities. We hope this
study will serve as an initial step toward uncovering the mechanistic roots of
compositional failures in VLMs. The code and supporting results can be found

### [4] [MSNav: Zero-Shot Vision-and-Language Navigation with Dynamic Memory and LLM Spatial Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16654)
*Chenghao Liu,Zhimu Zhou,Jiachen Zhang,Minghao Zhang,Songfang Huang,Huiling Duan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSNav是一个用于视觉语言导航的框架，通过集成记忆、空间和决策三个模块来解决现有LLM方法的脆弱性问题，在R2R和REVERIE数据集上取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于单一LLM的视觉语言导航方法存在空间推理能力差、跨模态对齐弱、长时任务内存过载等关键脆弱性问题，需要系统性地解决这些挑战。

Method: 提出MSNav框架，包含三个协同模块：1）动态地图记忆模块（选择性节点剪枝解决内存过载）；2）空间推理模块（基于Qwen-Sp模型处理对象关系推理）；3）LLM路径规划决策模块。还构建了I-O-S数据集来支持空间模块训练。

Result: 在Room-to-Room和REVERIE数据集上实现了最先进的性能，显著提高了成功率和路径长度加权成功率。Qwen-Sp模型在I-O-S测试集上的对象列表提取任务中超越了领先的商业LLM，获得了更高的F1和NDCG分数。

Conclusion: MSNav通过模块化架构将脆弱的推理转化为稳健的集成智能，有效解决了视觉语言导航中的关键挑战，为多模态导航系统提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires an agent to interpret natural
language instructions and navigate complex environments. Current approaches
often adopt a "black-box" paradigm, where a single Large Language Model (LLM)
makes end-to-end decisions. However, it is plagued by critical vulnerabilities,
including poor spatial reasoning, weak cross-modal grounding, and memory
overload in long-horizon tasks. To systematically address these issues, we
propose Memory Spatial Navigation(MSNav), a framework that fuses three modules
into a synergistic architecture, which transforms fragile inference into a
robust, integrated intelligence. MSNav integrates three modules: Memory Module,
a dynamic map memory module that tackles memory overload through selective node
pruning, enhancing long-range exploration; Spatial Module, a module for spatial
reasoning and object relationship inference that improves endpoint recognition;
and Decision Module, a module using LLM-based path planning to execute robust
actions. Powering Spatial Module, we also introduce an Instruction-Object-Space
(I-O-S) dataset and fine-tune the Qwen3-4B model into Qwen-Spatial (Qwen-Sp),
which outperforms leading commercial LLMs in object list extraction, achieving
higher F1 and NDCG scores on the I-O-S test set. Extensive experiments on the
Room-to-Room (R2R) and REVERIE datasets demonstrate MSNav's state-of-the-art
performance with significant improvements in Success Rate (SR) and Success
weighted by Path Length (SPL).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 土壤分类对土地管理、农业产量和环境问题解决至关重要，需要利用人工智能技术提高分类准确性和效率

Method: 采用卷积神经网络构建智能模型，使用鲸鱼优化算法和粒子群优化算法选择CNN超参数，通过Accuracy和F1指标评估系统性能

Result: 提出的方法获得了高效的分类结果，两种优化算法在土壤类型多分类过程中都表现出良好性能

Conclusion: 群体智能算法能有效优化CNN超参数，提高土壤图像分类的准确性和性能，为土壤分类提供了有价值的解决方案

Abstract: Classifying soil images contributes to better land management, increased
agricultural output, and practical solutions for environmental issues. The
development of various disciplines, particularly agriculture, civil
engineering, and natural resource management, is aided by understanding of soil
quality since it helps with risk reduction, performance improvement, and sound
decision-making . Artificial intelligence has recently been used in a number of
different fields. In this study, an intelligent model was constructed using
Convolutional Neural Networks to classify soil kinds, and machine learning
algorithms were used to enhance the performance of soil classification . To
achieve better implementation and performance of the Convolutional Neural
Networks algorithm and obtain valuable results for the process of classifying
soil type images, swarm algorithms were employed to obtain the best performance
by choosing Hyper parameters for the Convolutional Neural Networks network
using the Whale optimization algorithm and the Particle swarm optimization
algorithm, and comparing the results of using the two algorithms in the process
of multiple classification of soil types. The Accuracy and F1 measures were
adopted to test the system, and the results of the proposed work were efficient

### [6] [QA-VLM: Providing human-interpretable quality assessment for wire-feed laser additive manufacturing parts with Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16661)
*Qiaojie Zheng,Jiucai Zhang,Joy Gockel,Michael B. Wakin,Craig Brice,Xiaoli Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于视觉-语言模型的可解释性质量评估框架QA-VLM，通过注意力机制和领域知识融合，提供更可信的人类可理解的质量评估结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统深度学习方法在增材制造质量评估中的黑盒问题，提供可解释性评估以提升信任度和实际应用。

Method: 开发QA-VLM框架，结合视觉-语言模型的注意力机制和推理能力，并涵盖来自同行评审期刊的应用特定领域知识。

Result: 在24个单珍样品上评估，该框架在解释质量方面显示出比现成VLM更高的有效性和一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法为增材制造领域提供了可信赖、可解释的质量评估方案，具有广阔的应用潜力。

Abstract: Image-based quality assessment (QA) in additive manufacturing (AM) often
relies heavily on the expertise and constant attention of skilled human
operators. While machine learning and deep learning methods have been
introduced to assist in this task, they typically provide black-box outputs
without interpretable justifications, limiting their trust and adoption in
real-world settings. In this work, we introduce a novel QA-VLM framework that
leverages the attention mechanisms and reasoning capabilities of
vision-language models (VLMs), enriched with application-specific knowledge
distilled from peer-reviewed journal articles, to generate human-interpretable
quality assessments. Evaluated on 24 single-bead samples produced by laser wire
direct energy deposition (DED-LW), our framework demonstrates higher validity
and consistency in explanation quality than off-the-shelf VLMs. These results
highlight the potential of our approach to enable trustworthy, interpretable
quality assessment in AM applications.

### [7] [The Loupe: A Plug-and-Play Attention Module for Amplifying Discriminative Features in Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16663)
*Naren Sengodan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了The Loupe轻量级注意力模块，可插入预训练视觉Transformer中，无需部件级标注即可引导模型关注最具判别性的物体部位，在提升精度的同时提供可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 细粒度视觉分类需要识别细微的局部视觉线索，但现有大型视觉Transformer缺乏可解释性，难以在生物多样性监测和医疗诊断等关键应用中建立信任。

Method: 设计轻量级即插即用注意力模块The Loupe，使用复合损失函数进行端到端训练，隐式引导模型关注判别性区域，无需显式部件标注。

Result: 在CUB-200-2011数据集上，将Swin-Base模型准确率从85.40%提升至88.06%（提升2.66%），注意力图能有效定位语义有意义的特征。

Conclusion: 简单的内在注意力机制可作为强大正则化器，显著提升性能的同时提供清晰的可视化解释，为理解和信任模型决策过程提供有价值工具。

Abstract: Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) is a critical and challenging area
within computer vision, demanding the identification of highly subtle,
localized visual cues. The importance of FGVC extends to critical applications
such as biodiversity monitoring and medical diagnostics, where precision is
paramount. While large-scale Vision Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art
performance, their decision-making processes often lack the interpretability
required for trust and verification in such domains. In this paper, we
introduce The Loupe, a novel, lightweight, and plug-and-play attention module
designed to be inserted into pre-trained backbones like the Swin Transformer.
The Loupe is trained end-to-end with a composite loss function that implicitly
guides the model to focus on the most discriminative object parts without
requiring explicit part-level annotations. Our unique contribution lies in
demonstrating that a simple, intrinsic attention mechanism can act as a
powerful regularizer, significantly boosting performance while simultaneously
providing clear visual explanations. Our experimental evaluation on the
challenging CUB-200-2011 dataset shows that The Loupe improves the accuracy of
a Swin-Base model from 85.40% to 88.06%, a significant gain of 2.66%.
Crucially, our qualitative analysis of the learned attention maps reveals that
The Loupe effectively localizes semantically meaningful features, providing a
valuable tool for understanding and trusting the model's decision-making
process.

### [8] [COVID19 Prediction Based On CT Scans Of Lungs Using DenseNet Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16670)
*Deborup Sanyal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用卷积神经网络分析COVID-19患者的肺部CT扫描，预测感染严重程度（是否需要插管或导致死亡）


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: COVID-19大流行导致全球呼吸系统衰竭患者激增，医疗资源严重不足。传统诊断方法存在人为误差，需要自动化工具帮助医生快速准确判断病情严重程度

Method: 采用卷积神经网络(CNN)模型，基于患者CT扫描数据进行训练，分析COVID-19感染在一个月内的严重程度发展

Result: 论文未提供具体实验结果数据，但指出机器学习模型相比人工诊断更准确且不易出错，随着训练时间增加精度会提升

Conclusion: 基于CNN的CT扫描分析模型有望为医生提供COVID-19严重程度的客观评估工具，帮助优化医疗资源分配和临床决策

Abstract: COVID19 took the world by storm since December 2019. A highly infectious
communicable disease, COVID19 is caused by the SARSCoV2 virus. By March 2020,
the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID19 as a global pandemic. A
pandemic in the 21st century after almost 100 years was something the world was
not prepared for, which resulted in the deaths of around 1.6 million people
worldwide. The most common symptoms of COVID19 were associated with the
respiratory system and resembled a cold, flu, or pneumonia. After extensive
research, doctors and scientists concluded that the main reason for lives being
lost due to COVID19 was failure of the respiratory system. Patients were dying
gasping for breath. Top healthcare systems of the world were failing badly as
there was an acute shortage of hospital beds, oxygen cylinders, and
ventilators. Many were dying without receiving any treatment at all. The aim of
this project is to help doctors decide the severity of COVID19 by reading the
patient's Computed Tomography (CT) scans of the lungs. Computer models are less
prone to human error, and Machine Learning or Neural Network models tend to
give better accuracy as training improves over time. We have decided to use a
Convolutional Neural Network model. Given that a patient tests positive, our
model will analyze the severity of COVID19 infection within one month of the
positive test result. The severity of the infection may be promising or
unfavorable (if it leads to intubation or death), based entirely on the CT
scans in the dataset.

### [9] [MedRepBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Medical Report Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16674)
*Fangxin Shang,Yuan Xia,Dalu Yang,Yahui Wang,Binglin Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedRepBench是一个基于1900份真实中文医疗报告的综合基准测试，用于评估视觉语言模型在结构化医疗报告理解方面的性能，包含客观和主观评估协议，并通过GRPO优化方法实现了6%的召回率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗报告解释在医疗保健中至关重要，但目前缺乏标准化基准来评估结构化医疗报告理解的质量，特别是针对中文医疗报告。

Method: 构建包含1900份去标识化中文医疗报告的MedRepBench基准，支持两种评估协议：客观评估（测量结构化临床项目的字段级召回率）和自动化主观评估（使用LLM作为评分代理评估事实性、可解释性和推理质量）。采用GRPO方法优化视觉语言模型。

Result: 基于客观指标，通过GRPO优化中等规模VLM实现了高达6%的召回率增益。OCR+LLM管道虽然性能强劲，但存在布局盲区和延迟问题。

Conclusion: MedRepBench为结构化医疗报告理解提供了标准化评估框架，证明了视觉语言模型在医疗报告解释方面的潜力，同时指出了OCR+LLM方法的局限性，推动了向稳健、完全基于视觉的报告理解方向发展。

Abstract: Medical report interpretation plays a crucial role in healthcare, enabling
both patient-facing explanations and effective information flow across clinical
systems. While recent vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models
(LLMs) have demonstrated general document understanding capabilities, there
remains a lack of standardized benchmarks to assess structured interpretation
quality in medical reports. We introduce MedRepBench, a comprehensive benchmark
built from 1,900 de-identified real-world Chinese medical reports spanning
diverse departments, patient demographics, and acquisition formats. The
benchmark is designed primarily to evaluate end-to-end VLMs for structured
medical report understanding. To enable controlled comparisons, we also include
a text-only evaluation setting using high-quality OCR outputs combined with
LLMs, allowing us to estimate the upper-bound performance when character
recognition errors are minimized. Our evaluation framework supports two
complementary protocols: (1) an objective evaluation measuring field-level
recall of structured clinical items, and (2) an automated subjective evaluation
using a powerful LLM as a scoring agent to assess factuality, interpretability,
and reasoning quality. Based on the objective metric, we further design a
reward function and apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve
a mid-scale VLM, achieving up to 6% recall gain. We also observe that the
OCR+LLM pipeline, despite strong performance, suffers from layout-blindness and
latency issues, motivating further progress toward robust, fully vision-based
report understanding.

### [10] [Two-Stage Framework for Efficient UAV-Based Wildfire Video Analysis with Adaptive Compression and Fire Source Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16739)
*Yanbing Bai,Rui-Yang Ju,Lemeng Zhao,Junjie Hu,Jianchao Bi,Erick Mas,Shunichi Koshimura*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级两阶段框架，用于无人机实时野火监测和火源检测，通过帧压缩和策略网络减少计算成本，同时保持检测精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机在灾害应急响应中日益重要，但由于计算资源有限，无法独立运行大型模型进行实时视频分析，需要开发轻量高效的解决方案

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段使用策略网络和帧压缩技术识别并丢弃冗余视频片段，引入站点机制利用未来帧信息提高准确性；第二阶段使用改进的YOLOv8模型定位火源

Result: 实验表明，第一阶段在保持分类精度的同时显著降低计算成本，第二阶段相比基线方法在相似推理时间下获得更高检测精度

Conclusion: 该方法为无人机平台提供了有效的实时野火监测解决方案，在计算效率和检测精度之间取得了良好平衡

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have become increasingly important in
disaster emergency response by enabling real-time aerial video analysis. Due to
the limited computational resources available on UAVs, large models cannot be
run independently for real-time analysis. To overcome this challenge, we
propose a lightweight and efficient two-stage framework for real-time wildfire
monitoring and fire source detection on UAV platforms. Specifically, in Stage
1, we utilize a policy network to identify and discard redundant video clips
using frame compression techniques, thereby reducing computational costs. In
addition, we introduce a station point mechanism that leverages future frame
information within the sequential policy network to improve prediction
accuracy. In Stage 2, once the frame is classified as "fire", we employ the
improved YOLOv8 model to localize the fire source. We evaluate the Stage 1
method using the FLAME and HMDB51 datasets, and the Stage 2 method using the
Fire & Smoke dataset. Experimental results show that our method significantly
reduces computational costs while maintaining classification accuracy in Stage
1, and achieves higher detection accuracy with similar inference time in Stage
2 compared to baseline methods.

*Abdul Rehman Akbar,Usama Sajjad,Ziyu Su,Wencheng Li,Fei Xing,Jimmy Ruiz,Wei Chen,Muhammad Khalid Khan Niazi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CellEcoNet是一个新颖的空间感知深度学习框架，通过自然语言类比分析全切片图像，将细胞视为单词、细胞邻域视为短语、组织结构视为句子，自动学习上下文依赖含义来预测肺腺癌复发风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 约70%的侵袭性肺腺癌患者在术后5年内复发，现有工具无法准确识别需要辅助治疗的患者，存在未满足的临床需求。

Method: 采用自然语言类比方法，将全切片图像建模为语言结构：细胞作为单词，细胞邻域作为短语，组织结构作为句子，通过深度学习自动学习上下文依赖的空间交互模式。

Result: 在456个H&E染色全切片图像数据集上，CellEcoNet达到AUC 77.8%和HR 9.54，显著优于IASLC分级系统、AJCC分期和现有计算方法。

Conclusion: CellEcoNet不仅提供了优越的预后预测性能，还通过解码肿瘤微环境的细胞"语言"，揭示了细胞细微变化如何编码复发风险，代表了病理学分析的新范式转变。

Abstract: Despite surgical resection, ~70% of invasive lung adenocarcinoma (ILA)
patients recur within five years, and current tools fail to identify those
needing adjuvant therapy. To address this unmet clinical need, we introduce
CellEcoNet, a novel spatially aware deep learning framework that models whole
slide images (WSIs) through natural language analogy, defining a "language of
pathology," where cells act as words, cellular neighborhoods become phrases,
and tissue architecture forms sentences. CellEcoNet learns these
context-dependent meanings automatically, capturing how subtle variations and
spatial interactions derive recurrence risk. On a dataset of 456 H&E-stained
WSIs, CellEcoNet achieved superior predictive performance (AUC:77.8% HR:9.54),
outperforming IASLC grading system (AUC:71.4% HR:2.36), AJCC Stage (AUC:64.0%
HR:1.17) and state-of-the-art computational methods (AUCs:62.2-67.4%).
CellEcoNet demonstrated fairness and consistent performance across diverse
demographic and clinical subgroups. Beyond prognosis, CellEcoNet marks a
paradigm shift by decoding the tumor microenvironment's cellular "language" to
reveal how subtle cell variations encode recurrence risk.

*Marco N. Bochernitsan,Rodrigo C. Barros,Lucas S. Kupssinskü*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用帕累托最优前沿评估文本到图像模型公平性和效用的方法，通过超参数优化来平衡去偏效果和视觉质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像模型的公平性评估主要依赖定性判断或有限比较，缺乏可重复的评估方法，难以同时评估公平性和效用

Method: 使用帕累托最优前沿分析不同去偏方法的超参数配置，采用归一化香农熵评估公平性，ClipScore评估效用

Result: 评估了Stable Diffusion、Fair Diffusion、SDXL、DeCoDi和FLUX等模型，发现大多数默认超参数配置在公平性-效用空间中被支配，可以轻松找到更好的超参数

Conclusion: 该方法提供了可重复的公平性和效用评估框架，能够识别最优的超参数配置，为文本到图像模型的负责任AI发展提供支持

Abstract: Achieving fairness in text-to-image generation demands mitigating social
biases without compromising visual fidelity, a challenge critical to
responsible AI. Current fairness evaluation procedures for text-to-image models
rely on qualitative judgment or narrow comparisons, which limit the capacity to
assess both fairness and utility in these models and prevent reproducible
assessment of debiasing methods. Existing approaches typically employ ad-hoc,
human-centered visual inspections that are both error-prone and difficult to
replicate. We propose a method for evaluating fairness and utility in
text-to-image models using Pareto-optimal frontiers across hyperparametrization
of debiasing methods. Our method allows for comparison between distinct
text-to-image models, outlining all configurations that optimize fairness for a
given utility and vice-versa. To illustrate our evaluation method, we use
Normalized Shannon Entropy and ClipScore for fairness and utility evaluation,
respectively. We assess fairness and utility in Stable Diffusion, Fair
Diffusion, SDXL, DeCoDi, and FLUX text-to-image models. Our method shows that
most default hyperparameterizations of the text-to-image model are dominated
solutions in the fairness-utility space, and it is straightforward to find
better hyperparameters.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WebMMU是一个多语言基准测试，评估网站视觉问答、代码编辑和原型到代码生成三个核心Web任务，发现当前多模态大语言模型在推理、代码编辑和跨语言能力方面存在显著局限


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试将这些Web任务分开处理，需要统一的评估框架来测试模型在复杂多步推理、精确元素定位和功能性UI理解与编码方面的能力

Method: 使用专家标注的真实Web数据构建多语言基准测试，统一评估三个核心Web任务：网站视觉问答、HTML/CSS/JavaScript代码编辑、原型到代码生成

Result: 多模态大语言模型在基础信息提取方面表现良好，但在推理和定位、保持功能性的代码编辑、以及支持多语言内容的层次结构代码生成方面存在困难

Conclusion: 当前MLLMs存在关键局限性，需要改进多模态和跨语言推理能力，以构建能够自动化多样化Web开发任务的未来Web代理

Abstract: We present WebMMU, a multilingual benchmark that evaluates three core web
tasks: (1) website visual question answering, (2) code editing involving
HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and (3) mockup-to-code generation. Unlike prior benchmarks
that treat these tasks separately, WebMMU unifies them using expert-annotated,
real-world web data to assess models' abilities in complex multi-step
reasoning, precise element grounding, and functional UI comprehension and
coding. Our evaluation shows that while multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) perform well on basic information extraction, they struggle with
reasoning and grounding, editing code to preserve functionality, and generating
design-to-code that maintains hierarchy and supports multilingual content.
These findings reveal key limitations in current MLLMs and underscore the need
for improved multimodal and cross-lingual reasoning to build future web agents

TL;DR: RoentGen-v2是一个文本到图像的扩散模型，用于生成胸部X光片，能够精确控制放射学发现和人口统计学属性。通过合成数据预训练策略，显著提升了疾病分类模型的性能、泛化能力和公平性。


<details>

Motivation: 解决医学影像深度学习模型在不同患者群体中实现稳健性能和公平性的挑战，特别是在数据集规模和多样性有限的情况下。

Method: 开发RoentGen-v2文本到图像扩散模型，生成包含56.5万张图像的大型合成数据集。提出改进的训练策略：先使用合成数据进行监督预训练，然后在真实数据上进行微调。

Result: 在来自5个机构的13.7万张胸部X光片上进行评估，合成预训练使下游分类模型准确率提高6.5%，同时将诊断不足公平性差距减少19.3%。

Conclusion: 合成成像技术有潜力在真实世界数据约束下推进公平和可泛化的医学深度学习，证明了合成数据预训练策略的有效性。

Abstract: Achieving robust performance and fairness across diverse patient populations
remains a challenge in developing clinically deployable deep learning models
for diagnostic imaging. Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising
strategy to address limitations in dataset scale and diversity. We introduce
RoentGen-v2, a text-to-image diffusion model for chest radiographs that enables
fine-grained control over both radiographic findings and patient demographic
attributes, including sex, age, and race/ethnicity. RoentGen-v2 is the first
model to generate clinically plausible images with demographic conditioning,
facilitating the creation of a large, demographically balanced synthetic
dataset comprising over 565,000 images. We use this large synthetic dataset to
evaluate optimal training pipelines for downstream disease classification
models. In contrast to prior work that combines real and synthetic data
naively, we propose an improved training strategy that leverages synthetic data
for supervised pretraining, followed by fine-tuning on real data. Through
extensive evaluation on over 137,000 chest radiographs from five institutions,
we demonstrate that synthetic pretraining consistently improves model
performance, generalization to out-of-distribution settings, and fairness
across demographic subgroups. Across datasets, synthetic pretraining led to a
6.5% accuracy increase in the performance of downstream classification models,
compared to a modest 2.7% increase when naively combining real and synthetic
data. We observe this performance improvement simultaneously with the reduction
of the underdiagnosis fairness gap by 19.3%. These results highlight the
potential of synthetic imaging to advance equitable and generalizable medical
deep learning under real-world data constraints. We open source our code,
trained models, and synthetic dataset at

TL;DR: GPO是一种新颖的可变形视网膜图像配准框架，通过高斯基元优化和结构化消息传递，解决了视网膜图像中大面积同质区域和稀疏血管特征导致的梯度信号有限问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视网膜图像配准面临巨大挑战，因为大面积同质区域和稀疏但关键的血管特征导致标准学习框架中梯度信号有限，难以实现精确配准。

Method: 提出高斯基元优化(GPO)框架：1) 初始粗配准后提取关键点作为描述符控制节点；2) 每个节点建模为可训练的高斯基元；3) 使用KNN高斯插值传播位移信号；4) 通过多损失项进行端到端优化。

Result: 在FIRE数据集上，目标配准误差从6.2px降至~2.4px，25px处的AUC从0.770提升至0.938，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GPO框架通过战略性锚定高梯度区域节点，确保鲁棒梯度流，有效解决了视网膜图像配准中的梯度消失问题，实现了优异的配准性能。

Abstract: Deformable retinal image registration is notoriously difficult due to large
homogeneous regions and sparse but critical vascular features, which cause
limited gradient signals in standard learning-based frameworks. In this paper,
we introduce Gaussian Primitive Optimization (GPO), a novel iterative framework
that performs structured message passing to overcome these challenges. After an
initial coarse alignment, we extract keypoints at salient anatomical structures
(e.g., major vessels) to serve as a minimal set of descriptor-based control
nodes (DCN). Each node is modelled as a Gaussian primitive with trainable
position, displacement, and radius, thus adapting its spatial influence to
local deformation scales. A K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Gaussian interpolation
then blends and propagates displacement signals from these information-rich
nodes to construct a globally coherent displacement field; focusing
interpolation on the top (K) neighbors reduces computational overhead while
preserving local detail. By strategically anchoring nodes in high-gradient
regions, GPO ensures robust gradient flow, mitigating vanishing gradient signal
in textureless areas. The framework is optimized end-to-end via a multi-term
loss that enforces both keypoint consistency and intensity alignment.
Experiments on the FIRE dataset show that GPO reduces the target registration
error from 6.2\,px to ~2.4\,px and increases the AUC at 25\,px from 0.770 to
0.938, substantially outperforming existing methods. The source code can be

Motivation: 现有3D物体检测方法受限于闭集假设，难以识别现实场景中的新物体及其属性，需要开发能够处理开放词汇检测的解决方案。

Method: 使用基础模型特征拼接、提示调优策略、视角指定提示和水平翻转增强等技术，联合检测物体属性和空间关系等特征。

Abstract: 3D object detection plays a crucial role in autonomous systems, yet existing
methods are limited by closed-set assumptions and struggle to recognize novel
objects and their attributes in real-world scenarios. We propose OVODA, a novel
framework enabling both open-vocabulary 3D object and attribute detection with
no need to know the novel class anchor size. OVODA uses foundation models to
bridge the semantic gap between 3D features and texts while jointly detecting
attributes, e.g., spatial relationships, motion states, etc. To facilitate such
research direction, we propose OVAD, a new dataset that supplements existing 3D
object detection benchmarks with comprehensive attribute annotations. OVODA
incorporates several key innovations, including foundation model feature
concatenation, prompt tuning strategies, and specialized techniques for
attribute detection, including perspective-specified prompts and horizontal
flip augmentation. Our results on both the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets
show that under the condition of no given anchor sizes of novel classes, OVODA
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in open-vocabulary 3D object detection
while successfully recognizing object attributes. Our OVAD dataset is released

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有IQA方法过度关注总体分数拟合，忽视了人类从多个维度评估图像质量的事实

Method: 构建包含5个技术维度和4个美学维度的多分支网络，各分支单独训练后融合特征生成最终质量分数

Result: MDIQA在图像质量评估方面表现优异，并能有效灵活地应用于图像修复任务

Conclusion: 多维度的质量评估框架能更好地模拟人类视觉感知，为图像修复提供更灵活的用户偏好适配

Abstract: Recent advancements in image quality assessment (IQA), driven by
sophisticated deep neural network designs, have significantly improved the
ability to approach human perceptions. However, most existing methods are
obsessed with fitting the overall score, neglecting the fact that humans
typically evaluate image quality from different dimensions before arriving at
an overall quality assessment. To overcome this problem, we propose a
multi-dimensional image quality assessment (MDIQA) framework. Specifically, we
model image quality across various perceptual dimensions, including five
technical and four aesthetic dimensions, to capture the multifaceted nature of
human visual perception within distinct branches. Each branch of our MDIQA is
initially trained under the guidance of a separate dimension, and the
respective features are then amalgamated to generate the final IQA score.
Additionally, when the MDIQA model is ready, we can deploy it for a flexible
training of image restoration (IR) models, enabling the restoration results to
better align with varying user preferences through the adjustment of perceptual
dimension weights. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our MDIQA achieves
superior performance and can be effectively and flexibly applied to image
restoration tasks. The code is available: https://github.com/YaoShunyu19/MDIQA.

Motivation: 传统卷积神经网络(CNN)方法在天文图像处理中存在局限性，需要开发更适合像素级比较的架构，以提高超新星检测的准确性和效率。

Method: 采用Transformer架构的神经网络，直接分析搜索图像和模板图像，避免了计算密集的差异成像过程，专注于像素级详细比较。

Result: 在DES autoScan数据集上实现97.4%的分类准确率，随着训练集增大，差异图像的性能效用逐渐降低，网络在输入图像未对准超新星候选体时仍能保持相似性能水平。

Conclusion: 该Transformer网络显著提升了大规模天文巡天中超新星检测的准确性和效率，为天文瞬变源识别提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce a transformer-based neural network for the accurate
classification of real and bogus transient detections in astronomical images.
This network advances beyond the conventional convolutional neural network
(CNN) methods, widely used in image processing tasks, by adopting an
architecture better suited for detailed pixel-by-pixel comparison. The
architecture enables efficient analysis of search and template images only,
thus removing the necessity for computationally-expensive difference imaging,
while maintaining high performance. Our primary evaluation was conducted using
the autoScan dataset from the Dark Energy Survey (DES), where the network
achieved a classification accuracy of 97.4% and diminishing performance utility
for difference image as the size of the training set grew. Further experiments
with DES data confirmed that the network can operate at a similar level even
when the input images are not centered on the supernova candidate. These
findings highlight the network's effectiveness in enhancing both accuracy and
efficiency of supernova detection in large-scale astronomical surveys.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型需要多次迭代去噪步骤，限制了在需要高频控制的现实场景中的实用性

Method: 用归一化流(NF)替换扩散动作解码器，通过可逆变换实现单次采样，集成到FLOWER VLA架构并在LIBERO基准上微调

Result: NinA在相同训练机制下性能与基于扩散的解码器相当，但推理速度显著更快

Conclusion: NinA为高效、高频的VLA控制提供了一条有前景的路径，且不牺牲性能

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have established a
two-component architecture, where a pre-trained Vision-Language Model (VLM)
encodes visual observations and task descriptions, and an action decoder maps
these representations to continuous actions. Diffusion models have been widely
adopted as action decoders due to their ability to model complex, multimodal
action distributions. However, they require multiple iterative denoising steps
at inference time or downstream techniques to speed up sampling, limiting their
practicality in real-world settings where high-frequency control is crucial. In
this work, we present NinA (Normalizing Flows in Action), a fast and expressive
alter- native to diffusion-based decoders for VLAs. NinA replaces the diffusion
action decoder with a Normalizing Flow (NF) that enables one-shot sampling
through an invertible transformation, significantly reducing inference time. We
integrate NinA into the FLOWER VLA architecture and fine-tune on the LIBERO
benchmark. Our experiments show that NinA matches the performance of its
diffusion-based counterpart under the same training regime, while achieving
substantially faster inference. These results suggest that NinA offers a
promising path toward efficient, high-frequency VLA control without
compromising performance.

Abstract: This paper introduces a multi-agent framework for comprehensive highway scene
understanding, designed around a mixture-of-experts strategy. In this
framework, a large generic vision-language model (VLM), such as GPT-4o, is
contextualized with domain knowledge to generates task-specific
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts. These fine-grained prompts are then used to
guide a smaller, efficient VLM (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-7B) in reasoning over short
videos, along with complementary modalities as applicable. The framework
simultaneously addresses multiple critical perception tasks, including weather
classification, pavement wetness assessment, and traffic congestion detection,
achieving robust multi-task reasoning while balancing accuracy and
computational efficiency. To support empirical validation, we curated three
specialized datasets aligned with these tasks. Notably, the pavement wetness
dataset is multimodal, combining video streams with road weather sensor data,
highlighting the benefits of multimodal reasoning. Experimental results
demonstrate consistently strong performance across diverse traffic and
environmental conditions. From a deployment perspective, the framework can be
readily integrated with existing traffic camera systems and strategically
applied to high-risk rural locations, such as sharp curves, flood-prone
lowlands, or icy bridges. By continuously monitoring the targeted sites, the
system enhances situational awareness and delivers timely alerts, even in
resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: In the 6G era, the demand for higher system throughput and the implementation
of emerging 6G technologies require large-scale antenna arrays and accurate
spatial channel state information (Spatial-CSI). Traditional channel modeling
approaches, such as empirical models, ray tracing, and measurement-based
methods, face challenges in spatial resolution, efficiency, and scalability.
Radiance field-based methods have emerged as promising alternatives but still
suffer from geometric inaccuracy and costly supervision. This paper proposes
RF-PGS, a novel framework that reconstructs high-fidelity radio propagation
paths from only sparse path loss spectra. By introducing Planar Gaussians as
geometry primitives with certain RF-specific optimizations, RF-PGS achieves
dense, surface-aligned scene reconstruction in the first geometry training
stage. In the subsequent Radio Frequency (RF) training stage, the proposed
fully-structured radio radiance, combined with a tailored multi-view loss,
accurately models radio propagation behavior. Compared to prior radiance field
methods, RF-PGS significantly improves reconstruction accuracy, reduces
training costs, and enables efficient representation of wireless channels,
offering a practical solution for scalable 6G Spatial-CSI modeling.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been widely applied across
various fields due to their powerful perceptual and reasoning capabilities. In
the realm of psychology, these models hold promise for a deeper understanding
of human emotions and behaviors. However, recent research primarily focuses on
enhancing their emotion recognition abilities, leaving the substantial

benchmark, which encompasses 1,451 video data from real-life scenarios, along
with 5,101 progressive questions. These questions cover various aspects,
including emotion recognition, potential causes of emotions, future action

Furthermore, we conduct experiments with existing MLLMs and our agent-based
method on the proposed benchmark, revealing that most models face significant

Conclusion: 该方法实现了可扩展和高效的个性化扩散模型部署，为需要存储和部署大规模主题定制化的实际应用提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Personalized text-to-image models such as DreamBooth require fine-tuning
large-scale diffusion backbones, resulting in significant storage overhead when
maintaining many subject-specific models. We present Delta-SVD, a post-hoc,
training-free compression method that targets the parameter weights update
induced by DreamBooth fine-tuning. Our key observation is that these delta
weights exhibit strong low-rank structure due to the sparse and localized
nature of personalization. Delta-SVD first applies Singular Value Decomposition
(SVD) to factorize the weight deltas, followed by an energy-based rank
truncation strategy to balance compression efficiency and reconstruction
fidelity. The resulting compressed models are fully plug-and-play and can be
re-constructed on-the-fly during inference. Notably, the proposed approach is
simple, efficient, and preserves the original model architecture. Experiments
on a multiple subject dataset demonstrate that Delta-SVD achieves substantial
compression with negligible loss in generation quality measured by CLIP score,
SSIM and FID. Our method enables scalable and efficient deployment of
personalized diffusion models, making it a practical solution for real-world
applications that require storing and deploying large-scale subject
customizations.

Abstract: The increasing sophistication of image manipulation techniques demands robust
forensic solutions that can both reliably detect alterations and precisely
localize tampered regions. Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show
promise by leveraging world knowledge and semantic understanding for
context-aware detection, yet they struggle with perceiving subtle, low-level
forensic artifacts crucial for accurate manipulation localization. This paper
presents a novel Propose-Rectify framework that effectively bridges semantic
reasoning with forensic-specific analysis. In the proposal stage, our approach
utilizes a forensic-adapted LLaVA model to generate initial manipulation
analysis and preliminary localization of suspicious regions based on semantic
understanding and contextual reasoning. In the rectification stage, we
introduce a Forensics Rectification Module that systematically validates and
refines these initial proposals through multi-scale forensic feature analysis,
integrating technical evidence from several specialized filters. Additionally,
we present an Enhanced Segmentation Module that incorporates critical forensic
cues into SAM's encoded image embeddings, thereby overcoming inherent semantic
biases to achieve precise delineation of manipulated regions. By
synergistically combining advanced multimodal reasoning with established
forensic methodologies, our framework ensures that initial semantic proposals
are systematically validated and enhanced through concrete technical evidence,
resulting in comprehensive detection accuracy and localization precision.
Extensive experimental validation demonstrates state-of-the-art performance
across diverse datasets with exceptional robustness and generalization
capabilities.

Abstract: Understanding how visual content communicates sentiment is critical in an era
where online interaction is increasingly dominated by this kind of media on
social platforms. However, this remains a challenging problem, as sentiment
perception is closely tied to complex, scene-level semantics. In this paper, we
propose an original framework, MLLMsent, to investigate the sentiment reasoning
capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) through three
perspectives: (1) using those MLLMs for direct sentiment classification from
images; (2) associating them with pre-trained LLMs for sentiment analysis on
automatically generated image descriptions; and (3) fine-tuning the LLMs on
sentiment-labeled image descriptions. Experiments on a recent and established
benchmark demonstrate that our proposal, particularly the fine-tuned approach,
achieves state-of-the-art results outperforming Lexicon-, CNN-, and
Transformer-based baselines by up to 30.9%, 64.8%, and 42.4%, respectively,
across different levels of evaluators' agreement and sentiment polarity
categories. Remarkably, in a cross-dataset test, without any training on these
new data, our model still outperforms, by up to 8.26%, the best runner-up,
which has been trained directly on them. These results highlight the potential
of the proposed visual reasoning scheme for advancing affective computing,
while also establishing new benchmarks for future research.

*Xilai Li,Huichun Liu,Xiaosong Li,Tao Ye,Zhenyu Kuang,Huafeng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AWM-Fuse是一种针对恶劣天气条件的多模态图像融合方法，通过全局和局部文本感知模块，利用BLIP和ChatGPT生成的文本描述来提升语义感知和图像融合质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决恶劣天气条件下视觉信息丢失问题，现有方法缺乏对文本信息的有效分类和深入分析，需要更好的语义感知能力。

Method: 提出统一权重架构，包含全局特征感知模块（使用BLIP生成标题提取整体场景特征）和局部模块（使用ChatGPT详细描述处理具体退化效果），通过文本描述约束融合图像生成。

Result: 在复杂天气条件和下游任务中优于当前最先进方法，实验证明其有效性。

Conclusion: AWM-Fuse通过整合全局和局部文本感知，有效提升了恶劣天气下的多模态图像融合性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Multi-modality image fusion (MMIF) in adverse weather aims to address the
loss of visual information caused by weather-related degradations, providing
clearer scene representations. Although less studies have attempted to
incorporate textual information to improve semantic perception, they often lack
effective categorization and thorough analysis of textual content. In response,
we propose AWM-Fuse, a novel fusion method for adverse weather conditions,
designed to handle multiple degradations through global and local text
perception within a unified, shared weight architecture. In particular, a
global feature perception module leverages BLIP-produced captions to extract
overall scene features and identify primary degradation types, thus promoting
generalization across various adverse weather conditions. Complementing this,
the local module employs detailed scene descriptions produced by ChatGPT to
concentrate on specific degradation effects through concrete textual cues,
thereby capturing finer details. Furthermore, textual descriptions are used to
constrain the generation of fusion images, effectively steering the network
learning process toward better alignment with real semantic labels, thereby
promoting the learning of more meaningful visual features. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that AWM-Fuse outperforms current state-of-the-art
methods in complex weather conditions and downstream tasks. Our code is
available at https://github.com/Feecuin/AWM-Fuse.

TL;DR: SAEViT是一个轻量级视觉Transformer模型，通过稀疏注意力机制和卷积块结合，在降低计算复杂度的同时保持性能，在ImageNet-1K上达到76.3%-79.6%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformer虽然具有强大的长距离依赖建模能力，但存在模型尺寸大、计算成本高和局部特征建模能力弱的问题，限制了其在真实场景中的应用。

Method: 提出了SAEViT模型，包含：1）稀疏聚合注意力模块（SAA），基于图像冗余进行自适应稀疏采样并通过反卷积恢复特征图；2）通道交互前馈网络（CIFFN），通过特征分解和重分配增强通道间信息交换；3）分层金字塔结构，嵌入深度可分离卷积块（DWSConv）来增强卷积特征。

Result: 在主流数据集上的实验表明，SAEViT在ImageNet-1K分类任务上仅用0.8 GFLOPs和1.3 GFLOPs就分别达到了76.3%和79.6%的Top-1准确率。

Conclusion: SAEViT为各种基础视觉任务提供了一个轻量级解决方案，成功平衡了计算效率和性能。

Abstract: Vision Transformer (ViT) has prevailed in computer vision tasks due to its
strong long-range dependency modelling ability. However, its large model size
with high computational cost and weak local feature modeling ability hinder its
application in real scenarios. To balance computation efficiency and
performance, we propose SAEViT (Sparse-Attention-Efficient-ViT), a lightweight
ViT based model with convolution blocks, in this paper to achieve efficient
downstream vision tasks. Specifically, SAEViT introduces a Sparsely Aggregated
Attention (SAA) module that performs adaptive sparse sampling based on image
redundancy and recovers the feature map via deconvolution operation, which
significantly reduces the computational complexity of attention operations. In
addition, a Channel-Interactive Feed-Forward Network (CIFFN) layer is developed
to enhance inter-channel information exchange through feature decomposition and
redistribution, mitigating redundancy in traditional feed-forward networks
(FNN). Finally, a hierarchical pyramid structure with embedded depth-wise
separable convolutional blocks (DWSConv) is devised to further strengthen
convolutional features. Extensive experiments on mainstream datasets show that
SAEViT achieves Top-1 accuracies of 76.3\% and 79.6\% on the ImageNet-1K
classification task with only 0.8 GFLOPs and 1.3 GFLOPs, respectively,
demonstrating a lightweight solution for various fundamental vision tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SEGS是一个无需训练、即插即用的框架，通过定义结构能量并在采样时注入梯度来解决文本到3D生成中的Janus问题（正面正确但其他角度几何重复或扭曲的问题）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到3D生成存在Janus问题，即物体从正面看正确但从其他角度看会出现几何重复或扭曲。这源于2D扩散先验中的视角偏差，在3D优化过程中传播。

Method: 提出Structural Energy-Guided Sampling (SEGS)框架：1) 在中间U-Net特征的PCA子空间中定义结构能量；2) 在去噪轨迹中注入能量梯度；3) 引导几何朝向预期视角同时保持外观保真度；4) 无缝集成到SDS/VSD流程中。

Result: SEGS显著减少了Janus伪影，实现了更好的几何对齐和视角一致性，且无需重新训练或权重修改。

Conclusion: SEGS通过采样时的多视角一致性约束有效解决了文本到3D生成中的Janus问题，是一个训练无关的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-3D generation often suffers from the Janus problem, where objects
look correct from the front but collapse into duplicated or distorted geometry
from other angles. We attribute this failure to viewpoint bias in 2D diffusion
priors, which propagates into 3D optimization. To address this, we propose
Structural Energy-Guided Sampling (SEGS), a training-free, plug-and-play
framework that enforces multi-view consistency entirely at sampling time. SEGS
defines a structural energy in a PCA subspace of intermediate U-Net features
and injects its gradients into the denoising trajectory, steering geometry
toward the intended viewpoint while preserving appearance fidelity. Integrated
seamlessly into SDS/VSD pipelines, SEGS significantly reduces Janus artifacts,
achieving improved geometric alignment and viewpoint consistency without
retraining or weight modification.

*Yudong Hu,Yueju Han,Rui Sun,Jinke Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSPCaps是一个新颖的多尺度胶囊网络架构，通过多尺度特征提取、统一补丁化胶囊层和跨协议路由机制，有效解决了传统胶囊网络忽视多尺度特征和特征融合困难的问题，在分类准确率和模型效率方面都表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有胶囊网络通常依赖单一高层特征图，忽略了多尺度特征的丰富互补信息，且传统特征融合策略难以协调多尺度特征差异，导致分类性能不佳。

Method: 提出MSPCaps架构，包含三个核心组件：多尺度ResNet骨干网络(MSRB)提取多尺度特征；补丁化胶囊层(PatchifyCaps)将多尺度特征统一分割成初级胶囊；跨协议路由(CAR)块通过识别最大协议跨尺度预测对来自适应路由多尺度胶囊。

Result: MSPCaps展现出卓越的可扩展性和鲁棒性，在分类准确率方面持续超越多个基线方法，模型配置从高效的Tiny模型(344.3K参数)到强大的Large模型(10.9M参数)。

Conclusion: MSPCaps通过有效整合多尺度特征学习和高效胶囊路由，在特征表示学习方面具有重要推进潜力，为视觉识别任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Capsule Network (CapsNet) has demonstrated significant potential in visual
recognition by capturing spatial relationships and part-whole hierarchies for
learning equivariant feature representations. However, existing CapsNet and
variants often rely on a single high-level feature map, overlooking the rich
complementary information from multi-scale features. Furthermore, conventional
feature fusion strategies (e.g., addition and concatenation) struggle to
reconcile multi-scale feature discrepancies, leading to suboptimal
classification performance. To address these limitations, we propose the
Multi-Scale Patchify Capsule Network (MSPCaps), a novel architecture that
integrates multi-scale feature learning and efficient capsule routing.
Specifically, MSPCaps consists of three key components: a Multi-Scale ResNet
Backbone (MSRB), a Patchify Capsule Layer (PatchifyCaps), and Cross-Agreement
Routing (CAR) blocks. First, the MSRB extracts diverse multi-scale feature
representations from input images, preserving both fine-grained details and
global contextual information. Second, the PatchifyCaps partitions these
multi-scale features into primary capsules using a uniform patch size,
equipping the model with the ability to learn from diverse receptive fields.
Finally, the CAR block adaptively routes the multi-scale capsules by
identifying cross-scale prediction pairs with maximum agreement. Unlike the
simple concatenation of multiple self-routing blocks, CAR ensures that only the
most coherent capsules contribute to the final voting. Our proposed MSPCaps
achieves remarkable scalability and superior robustness, consistently
surpassing multiple baseline methods in terms of classification accuracy, with
configurations ranging from a highly efficient Tiny model (344.3K parameters)
to a powerful Large model (10.9M parameters), highlighting its potential in
advancing feature representation learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心脏磁共振(CMR)是心肌病诊断的金标准，但依赖钆对比剂和人工密集解读限制了其在人群规模筛查中的应用，需要开发无钆的高效筛查方法

Method: 提出对比学习和跨模态对齐框架，通过特征交互模块优化诊断精度和跨模态特征一致性，采用不确定性引导的自适应训练机制动态校准任务特定目标

Result: 在多中心231名受试者数据上评估，CC-CMR达到0.943的准确率(95% CI: 0.886-0.986)，比最先进的纯电影CMR模型提升4.3%，同时消除了钆依赖

Conclusion: CC-CMR展示了在广泛人群和医疗环境中进行无钆心肌病筛查的临床可行性，为大规模筛查提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Cardiomyopathy, a principal contributor to heart failure and sudden cardiac
mortality, demands precise early screening. Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR),
recognized as the diagnostic 'gold standard' through multiparametric protocols,
holds the potential to serve as an accurate screening tool. However, its
reliance on gadolinium contrast and labor-intensive interpretation hinders
population-scale deployment. We propose CC-CMR, a Contrastive Learning and
Cross-Modal alignment framework for gadolinium-free cardiomyopathy screening
using cine CMR sequences. By aligning the latent spaces of cine CMR and Late
Gadolinium Enhancement (LGE) sequences, our model encodes fibrosis-specific
pathology into cine CMR embeddings. A Feature Interaction Module concurrently
optimizes diagnostic precision and cross-modal feature congruence, augmented by
an uncertainty-guided adaptive training mechanism that dynamically calibrates
task-specific objectives to ensure model generalizability. Evaluated on
multi-center data from 231 subjects, CC-CMR achieves accuracy of 0.943 (95% CI:
0.886-0.986), outperforming state-of-the-art cine-CMR-only models by 4.3% while
eliminating gadolinium dependency, demonstrating its clinical viability for
wide range of populations and healthcare environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D个性化方法主要依赖基于知识蒸馏的方法，需要计算昂贵的重新训练过程，而2D图像个性化技术无法直接应用于3D内容

Method: 开发相机条件化的3D到文本逆机制，将3D内容投影到与文本嵌入对齐的3D嵌入空间中

Result: 广泛的实验证明Invert3D能够有效实现3D内容的个性化

Conclusion: 该方法通过建立3D-文本对齐，实现了高效便捷的3D内容个性化，无需计算密集的重新训练过程

Abstract: Recent advances in NeRF and 3DGS have significantly enhanced the efficiency
and quality of 3D content synthesis. However, efficient personalization of
generated 3D content remains a critical challenge. Current 3D personalization
approaches predominantly rely on knowledge distillation-based methods, which
require computationally expensive retraining procedures. To address this
challenge, we propose \textbf{Invert3D}, a novel framework for convenient 3D
content personalization. Nowadays, vision-language models such as CLIP enable
direct image personalization through aligned vision-text embedding spaces.
However, the inherent structural differences between 3D content and 2D images
preclude direct application of these techniques to 3D personalization. Our
approach bridges this gap by establishing alignment between 3D representations
and text embedding spaces. Specifically, we develop a camera-conditioned
3D-to-text inverse mechanism that projects 3D contents into a 3D embedding
aligned with text embeddings. This alignment enables efficient manipulation and
personalization of 3D content through natural language prompts, eliminating the
need for computationally retraining procedures. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Invert3D achieves effective personalization of 3D content. Our

TL;DR: NAT方法通过攻击特定神经元而非整个嵌入层来提升对抗样本的可迁移性，在跨模型和跨域设置中分别超过现有基线14%和4%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在嵌入层级别进行优化时往往过度关注少数相似概念的神经元，而忽略了层内其他神经元，导致可迁移性受限

Method: 提出神经元攻击可迁移性(NAT)方法，从嵌入层分离转向神经元特异性攻击，针对个体神经元进行优化以破坏神经网络的核心单元

Result: 在41个ImageNet模型和9个细粒度模型上的实验显示，NAT在跨模型设置中超过基线14%以上，跨域设置中超过4%，且仅需10次查询即可获得高欺骗率

Conclusion: 神经元级别的攻击为对抗样本可迁移性提供了更基础有效的方法，通过针对神经网络核心单元实现了显著的性能提升

Abstract: The generation of transferable adversarial perturbations typically involves
training a generator to maximize embedding separation between clean and
adversarial images at a single mid-layer of a source model. In this work, we
build on this approach and introduce Neuron Attack for Transferability (NAT), a
method designed to target specific neuron within the embedding. Our approach is
motivated by the observation that previous layer-level optimizations often
disproportionately focus on a few neurons representing similar concepts,
leaving other neurons within the attacked layer minimally affected. NAT shifts
the focus from embedding-level separation to a more fundamental,
neuron-specific approach. We find that targeting individual neurons effectively
disrupts the core units of the neural network, providing a common basis for
transferability across different models. Through extensive experiments on 41
diverse ImageNet models and 9 fine-grained models, NAT achieves fooling rates
that surpass existing baselines by over 14\% in cross-model and 4\% in
cross-domain settings. Furthermore, by leveraging the complementary attacking
capabilities of the trained generators, we achieve impressive fooling rates
within just 10 queries. Our code is available at:

Conclusion: HieroAction通过结合分步推理和策略学习，成功实现了准确、结构化且可解释的人类动作评估，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Evaluating human actions with clear and detailed feedback is important in
areas such as sports, healthcare, and robotics, where decisions rely not only
on final outcomes but also on interpretable reasoning. However, most existing
methods provide only a final score without explanation or detailed analysis,
limiting their practical applicability. To address this, we introduce
HieroAction, a vision-language model that delivers accurate and structured
assessments of human actions. HieroAction builds on two key ideas: (1) Stepwise
Action Reasoning, a tailored chain of thought process designed specifically for
action assessment, which guides the model to evaluate actions step by step,
from overall recognition through sub action analysis to final scoring, thus
enhancing interpretability and structured understanding; and (2) Hierarchical
Policy Learning, a reinforcement learning strategy that enables the model to
learn fine grained sub action dynamics and align them with high level action
quality, thereby improving scoring precision. The reasoning pathway structures
the evaluation process, while policy learning refines each stage through reward
based optimization. Their integration ensures accurate and interpretable
assessments, as demonstrated by superior performance across multiple benchmark
datasets. Code will be released upon acceptance.

Conclusion: RPD-Diff通过物理引导和区域自适应机制，有效解决了密集非均匀雾霾去雾的挑战，为复杂雾霾场景下的能见度增强提供了鲁棒解决方案。

Abstract: Single-image dehazing under dense and non-uniform haze conditions remains
challenging due to severe information degradation and spatial heterogeneity.
Traditional diffusion-based dehazing methods struggle with insufficient
generation conditioning and lack of adaptability to spatially varying haze
distributions, which leads to suboptimal restoration. To address these
limitations, we propose RPD-Diff, a Region-adaptive Physics-guided Dehazing
Diffusion Model for robust visibility enhancement in complex haze scenarios.
RPD-Diff introduces a Physics-guided Intermediate State Targeting (PIST)
strategy, which leverages physical priors to reformulate the diffusion Markov
chain by generation target transitions, mitigating the issue of insufficient
conditioning in dense haze scenarios. Additionally, the Haze-Aware Denoising
Timestep Predictor (HADTP) dynamically adjusts patch-specific denoising
timesteps employing a transmission map cross-attention mechanism, adeptly
managing non-uniform haze distributions. Extensive experiments across four
real-world datasets demonstrate that RPD-Diff achieves state-of-the-art
performance in challenging dense and non-uniform haze scenarios, delivering
high-quality, haze-free images with superior detail clarity and color fidelity.

TL;DR: 本文提出LIMM模型，通过窗口划分和对比学习增强人群计数中的局部建模能力，在多个数据集上实现SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新思考人群计数的本质特征：个体（人头）通常只占图像的很小部分，现有方法过度追求大感受野而忽视了局部建模能力的重要性

Method: 提出LIMM模型，采用窗口划分设计将输入分割为网格窗口，使用窗口级对比学习增强局部密度区分能力，并在模型末端加入全局注意力模块处理偶尔出现的大尺寸个体

Result: 在多个公开数据集上实验表明，模型在局部建模能力上有显著提升（如JHU-Crowd++高密度子集MAE提升8.7%），同时保持对大尺寸个体的计数能力，达到最先进性能

Conclusion: 强调局部建模能力是人群计数模型设计的重要原则，LIMM模型通过创新的窗口设计和对比学习方法有效提升了计数精度

Abstract: The motivation of this paper originates from rethinking an essential
characteristic of crowd counting: individuals (heads of humans) in the crowd
counting task typically occupy a very small portion of the image. This
characteristic has never been the focus of existing works: they typically use
the same backbone as other visual tasks and pursue a large receptive field.
This drives us to propose a new model design principle of crowd counting:
emphasizing local modeling capability of the model. We follow the principle and
design a crowd counting model named Local Information Matters Model (LIMM). The
main innovation lies in two strategies: a window partitioning design that
applies grid windows to the model input, and a window-wise contrastive learning
design to enhance the model's ability to distinguish between local density
levels. Moreover, a global attention module is applied to the end of the model
to handle the occasionally occurring large-sized individuals. Extensive
experiments on multiple public datasets illustrate that the proposed model
shows a significant improvement in local modeling capability (8.7\% in MAE on
the JHU-Crowd++ high-density subset for example), without compromising its
ability to count large-sized ones, which achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: RDR框架有效提升了多模态大语言模型在视觉退化科学图表中的鲁棒性，提出的新指标和数据集为评估模型在真实场景中的性能提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal variants (LVLMs) hold
immense promise for scientific and engineering applications, particularly in
processing visual information like scientific diagrams. However, their
practical deployment is hindered by a critical lack of robustness to common
visual perturbations such as noise, blur, and occlusions, which are prevalent
in real-world scientific documents. Existing evaluation benchmarks largely
overlook this challenge, leaving the robust reasoning capabilities of LVLMs on
visually degraded scientific diagrams underexplored. To address this, we
introduce the Robust Diagram Reasoning (RDR) framework, a novel approach
designed to enhance and rigorously evaluate LVLMs' performance under such
conditions. At its core, RDR employs an Adaptive Multi-View & Consistency
Verification (AMCV) mechanism, which involves generating multiple perturbed
versions of a diagram, performing parallel inference, and then applying a
consistency-based self-correction loop. We also propose two new metrics,
Perturbation Robustness Score (PRS) and Visual Degradation Consistency (VDC),
to quantify robustness. Furthermore, we construct SciDiagram-Robust, the first
large-scale scientific diagram question-answering dataset specifically
augmented with diverse, programmatically generated visual perturbations. Our
extensive experiments demonstrate that even state-of-the-art closed-source
LVLMs like GPT-4V exhibit significant performance degradation when faced with
perturbed inputs (Clean Accuracy 85.2% vs. PRS 72.1%).

Abstract: Regression is fundamental in computer vision and is widely used in various
tasks including age estimation, depth estimation, target localization, \etc
However, real-world data often exhibits imbalanced distribution, making
regression models perform poorly especially for target values with rare
observations~(known as the imbalanced regression problem). In this paper, we
reframe imbalanced regression as an imbalanced generalization problem. To
tackle that, we look into the loss sharpness property for measuring the
generalization ability of regression models in the observation space. Namely,
given a certain perturbation on the model parameters, we check how model
performance changes according to the loss values of different target
observations. We propose a simple yet effective approach called Balanced
Sharpness-Aware Minimization~(BSAM) to enforce the uniform generalization
ability of regression models for the entire observation space. In particular,
we start from the traditional sharpness-aware minimization and then introduce a
novel targeted reweighting strategy to homogenize the generalization ability
across the observation space, which guarantees a theoretical generalization
bound. Extensive experiments on multiple vision regression tasks, including age
and depth estimation, demonstrate that our BSAM method consistently outperforms
existing approaches. The code is available

TL;DR: HCG-LVLM是一种分层上下文接地视觉语言大模型，通过模仿人类从粗到细的认知处理过程，解决了现有LVLM在精确图像区域定位和细粒度视觉推理中的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言大模型在复杂真实场景中表现出鲁棒性不足、容易产生幻觉和推理错误的问题，特别是在需要精确图像区域定位和细粒度视觉推理的任务中。

Method: 提出HCG-LVLM架构，包含全局上下文感知层和细粒度局部接地层。局部接地层包括局部细节增强模块（提取高分辨率特征）和语义一致性验证器（确保准确的视觉语言对齐）。通过自适应融合机制整合两层信息。

Conclusion: 分层设计有效增强了细粒度视觉语言理解和精确接地能力，验证了从粗到细认知处理方法的有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) have
achieved remarkable progress in natural language processing and multimodal
understanding. Despite their impressive generalization capabilities, current
LVLMs often exhibit insufficient robustness, proneness to hallucination, and
reasoning errors in complex real-world scenarios, particularly when precise
image region localization and fine-grained visual reasoning are required. To
address these limitations, we propose the Hierarchical Contextual Grounding
LVLM (HCG-LVLM), a novel architecture that mimics human coarse-to-fine
cognitive processing. HCG-LVLM employs a two-layered approach: a Global
Contextual Perception layer for initial broad understanding and a Fine-grained
Local Grounding layer. The latter incorporates a Local Detail Enhancement
Module to extract high-resolution features and a Semantic Consistency Validator
to ensure accurate, hallucination-free visual-language alignment. Through an
adaptive fusion mechanism, information from both layers is integrated for
robust and precise outputs. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets,
including GQA, A-OKVQA for fine-grained VQA, and RefCOCO/+/g for Referring
Expression Comprehension, demonstrate that HCG-LVLM consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art models such as Flamingo, BLIP-2, and MiniGPT-4. Our model
achieves superior accuracy and significantly reduces hallucination, validating
the effectiveness of its hierarchical design in enhancing fine-grained
visual-language understanding and precise grounding capabilities.

TL;DR: JPS是一种新的领域泛化方法，通过选择性地微调预训练模型中的稀疏参数子集，在保持模型泛化能力的同时实现任务适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决全参数微调会损害预训练模型固有泛化能力的问题，需要在任务适应和泛化保持之间取得平衡。

Method: 使用双操作符选择机制，识别和更新在所有源域中表现出一致且显著梯度的参数，限制只更新少量稀疏参数子集。

Result: 在广泛的基准实验中，JPS相比最先进的领域泛化方法取得了更优越的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法既高效又有效，通过理论泛化误差边界为选择性微调提供了原理性证明。

Abstract: Domain generalization seeks to develop models trained on a limited set of
source domains that are capable of generalizing effectively to unseen target
domains. While the predominant approach leverages large-scale pre-trained
vision models as initialization, recent studies have highlighted that full
fine-tuning can compromise the intrinsic generalization capabilities of these
models. To address this limitation, parameter-efficient adaptation strategies
have emerged, wherein only a subset of model parameters is selectively
fine-tuned, thereby balancing task adaptation with the preservation of
generalization. Motivated by this paradigm, we introduce Joint Parameter
Selection (JPS), a novel method that restricts updates to a small, sparse
subset of parameters, thereby retaining and harnessing the generalization
strength of pre-trained models. Theoretically, we establish a generalization
error bound that explicitly accounts for the sparsity of parameter updates,
thereby providing a principled justification for selective fine-tuning.
Practically, we design a selection mechanism employing dual operators to
identify and update parameters exhibiting consistent and significant gradients
across all source domains. Extensive benchmark experiments demonstrate that JPS
achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art domain
generalization methods, substantiating both the efficiency and efficacy of the
proposed approach.

Motivation: 扩散模型迭代采样计算成本过高，现有特征缓存方法因无法建模复杂特征演化动态而导致质量损失

Method: 利用扩散变换器中特征导数近似呈现多元高斯特性的洞察，采用Hermite多项式作为理论最优基函数，并引入双尺度机制确保数值稳定性

Result: 在FLUX.1-dev上实现6.24倍加速且超越基线质量，在文本到图像、视频生成和超分辨率任务中均保持强劲性能

Conclusion: HiCache通过数学工具与经验特性的对齐，从根本上改进了特征预测，为扩散模型提供了高效且高质量的推理加速方案

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in content generation but
suffer from prohibitive computational costs due to iterative sampling. While
recent feature caching methods tend to accelerate inference through temporal
extrapolation, these methods still suffer from server quality loss due to the
failure in modeling the complex dynamics of feature evolution. To solve this
problem, this paper presents HiCache, a training-free acceleration framework
that fundamentally improves feature prediction by aligning mathematical tools
with empirical properties. Our key insight is that feature derivative
approximations in Diffusion Transformers exhibit multivariate Gaussian
characteristics, motivating the use of Hermite polynomials-the potentially
theoretically optimal basis for Gaussian-correlated processes. Besides, We
further introduce a dual-scaling mechanism that ensures numerical stability
while preserving predictive accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate
HiCache's superiority: achieving 6.24x speedup on FLUX.1-dev while exceeding
baseline quality, maintaining strong performance across text-to-image, video
generation, and super-resolution tasks. Core implementation is provided in the
appendix, with complete code to be released upon acceptance.

Motivation: 当前深度学习分割方法往往无法平衡分割精度和计算效率，要么性能好但计算复杂，要么效率高但精度低。

Method: 提出EDLDNet网络，包含噪声解码器（训练时加入结构化扰动增强鲁棒性，推理时只使用无噪声解码器降低计算成本）、多尺度卷积注意力模块、注意力门和上卷积块，并使用基于变异的损失函数。

Conclusion: EDLDNet在保持计算效率的同时实现了优异的性能，展现出强大的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Proper segmentation of organs-at-risk is important for radiation therapy,
surgical planning, and diagnostic decision-making in medical image analysis.
While deep learning-based segmentation architectures have made significant
progress, they often fail to balance segmentation accuracy with computational
efficiency. Most of the current state-of-the-art methods either prioritize
performance at the cost of high computational complexity or compromise accuracy
for efficiency. This paper addresses this gap by introducing an efficient
dual-line decoder segmentation network (EDLDNet). The proposed method features
a noisy decoder, which learns to incorporate structured perturbation at
training time for better model robustness, yet at inference time only the
noise-free decoder is executed, leading to lower computational cost.
Multi-Scale convolutional Attention Modules (MSCAMs), Attention Gates (AGs),
and Up-Convolution Blocks (UCBs) are further utilized to optimize feature
representation and boost segmentation performance. By leveraging multi-scale
segmentation masks from both decoders, we also utilize a mutation-based loss
function to enhance the model's generalization. Our approach outperforms SOTA
segmentation architectures on four publicly available medical imaging datasets.
EDLDNet achieves SOTA performance with an 84.00% Dice score on the Synapse
dataset, surpassing baseline model like UNet by 13.89% in Dice score while
significantly reducing Multiply-Accumulate Operations (MACs) by 89.7%. Compared
to recent approaches like EMCAD, our EDLDNet not only achieves higher Dice
score but also maintains comparable computational efficiency. The outstanding
performance across diverse datasets establishes EDLDNet's strong
generalization, computational efficiency, and robustness. The source code,
pre-processed data, and pre-trained weights will be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有弱监督语义分割方法过于强调类间分离，忽略了相关类别间的共享语义，缺乏细粒度区分能力

Method: 提出对比提示聚类(CPC)框架：1)利用大语言模型推导编码类间关系的类别聚类 2)引入类感知的patch级对比损失来增强类内一致性和类间分离

Result: 在PASCAL VOC 2012和MS COCO 2014数据集上的实验表明，CPC超越了现有的最先进弱监督语义分割方法

Conclusion: CPC的分层设计利用聚类作为粗粒度语义先验，同时保持细粒度边界，有效减少了视觉相似类别间的混淆

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) with image-level labels has
gained attention for its cost-effectiveness. Most existing methods emphasize
inter-class separation, often neglecting the shared semantics among related
categories and lacking fine-grained discrimination. To address this, we propose
Contrastive Prompt Clustering (CPC), a novel WSSS framework. CPC exploits Large
Language Models (LLMs) to derive category clusters that encode intrinsic
inter-class relationships, and further introduces a class-aware patch-level
contrastive loss to enforce intra-class consistency and inter-class separation.
This hierarchical design leverages clusters as coarse-grained semantic priors
while preserving fine-grained boundaries, thereby reducing confusion among
visually similar categories. Experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014
demonstrate that CPC surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in WSSS.

Motivation: 传统基于网格的3D模拟在复杂环境（如密集温室）中表现不佳，而现有的神经渲染方法虽然视觉真实感强，但缺乏集成基准标记的能力，而这对机器人定位和控制至关重要。

Method: 开发了一种混合框架，将高斯泼溅（GS）的光照真实感与结构化标记表示相结合，提出了一种新颖算法来在杂乱场景中高效生成基于GS的基准标记（如AprilTags）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在效率和姿态估计精度方面均优于传统的图像拟合技术，并在温室模拟中验证了框架的潜力。

Conclusion: 该框架在具有密集 foliage、相似元素和遮挡的农业环境中表现出色，展示了其在现实世界应用中的价值，特别是在机器人感知和定位方面。

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D simulation is critical for training mobile robots, but its
traditional reliance on mesh-based representations often struggle in complex
environments, such as densely packed greenhouses featuring occlusions and
repetitive structures. Recent neural rendering methods, like Gaussian Splatting
(GS), achieve remarkable visual realism but lack flexibility to incorporate
fiducial markers, which are essential for robotic localization and control. We
propose a hybrid framework that combines the photorealism of GS with structured
marker representations. Our core contribution is a novel algorithm for
efficiently generating GS-based fiducial markers (e.g., AprilTags) within
cluttered scenes. Experiments show that our approach outperforms traditional
image-fitting techniques in both efficiency and pose-estimation accuracy. We
further demonstrate the framework's potential in a greenhouse simulation. This
agricultural setting serves as a challenging testbed, as its combination of
dense foliage, similar-looking elements, and occlusions pushes the limits of
perception, thereby highlighting the framework's value for real-world
applications.

TL;DR: 通过双正交引导(DOG)采样策略改善扩散模型在手写文本生成中的读取性和风格变化性，减少记忆化和扭曲问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准扩散模型在手写文本生成中存在记忆化训练样本、风格变化性不足和生成清晰度不高的问题，尤其在复杂风格和词汇外单词时产生扭曲和伪影

Method: 提出双正交引导(DOG)策略，利用负吐烈提示的正交投影到原始正吐烈上，在潜空间中引入更稳定、解耦的方向。采用三角形调度控制引导强度：在去噪过程的开始和结束阶段弱引导，在中间步骤强引导

Result: 在DiffusionPen和One-DM上的实验结果显示，DOG在内容清晰度和风格变化性方面都有显著改善，甚至对词汇外单词和具有挑战性的写作风格也有效

Conclusion: DOG提供了一种更有效的采样引导方法，能够生成更多样化且可信的手写文本，减少标准扩散模型常见的伪影和扭曲问题

Abstract: Diffusion-based Handwritten Text Generation (HTG) approaches achieve
impressive results on frequent, in-vocabulary words observed at training time
and on regular styles. However, they are prone to memorizing training samples
and often struggle with style variability and generation clarity. In
particular, standard diffusion models tend to produce artifacts or distortions
that negatively affect the readability of the generated text, especially when
the style is hard to produce. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel
sampling guidance strategy, Dual Orthogonal Guidance (DOG), that leverages an
orthogonal projection of a negatively perturbed prompt onto the original
positive prompt. This approach helps steer the generation away from artifacts
while maintaining the intended content, and encourages more diverse, yet
plausible, outputs. Unlike standard Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), which
relies on unconditional predictions and produces noise at high guidance scales,
DOG introduces a more stable, disentangled direction in the latent space. To
control the strength of the guidance across the denoising process, we apply a
triangular schedule: weak at the start and end of denoising, when the process
is most sensitive, and strongest in the middle steps. Experimental results on
the state-of-the-art DiffusionPen and One-DM demonstrate that DOG improves both
content clarity and style variability, even for out-of-vocabulary words and
challenging writing styles.

Conclusion: PTMA模型通过概率建模和时序掩码注意力机制，有效提升了在线动作检测在跨视角场景下的泛化能力和性能表现。

Abstract: As a critical task in video sequence classification within computer vision,
Online Action Detection (OAD) has garnered significant attention. The
sensitivity of mainstream OAD models to varying video viewpoints often hampers
their generalization when confronted with unseen sources. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel Probabilistic Temporal Masked Attention (PTMA)
model, which leverages probabilistic modeling to derive latent compressed
representations of video frames in a cross-view setting. The PTMA model
incorporates a GRU-based temporal masked attention (TMA) cell, which leverages
these representations to effectively query the input video sequence, thereby
enhancing information interaction and facilitating autoregressive frame-level
video analysis. Additionally, multi-view information can be integrated into the
probabilistic modeling to facilitate the extraction of view-invariant features.
Experiments conducted under three evaluation protocols: cross-subject (cs),
cross-view (cv), and cross-subject-view (csv) show that PTMA achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the DAHLIA, IKEA ASM, and Breakfast datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的重构学习方法基于深度卷积网络，存在跨物体类别和生成领域的演化性不佳问题，主要原因是过依赖语义特征分布和全局平均池化导致关键局部伪造线索丢失。

Method: 提出局部聚焦机制(LFM)，整合显著性网络(SNet)和Top-K池化(TKP)模块来选择K个最信息丰富的局部模式。为避免Top-K池化导致的过拟合，引入了秩基线性丢弃(RBLD)和随机K采样(RKS)两种正则化技术。

Result: LFM在准确率上比最先进的Neighboring Pixel Relationships(NPR)方法提高3.7%，平均精度提高2.8%，同时保持了高效能(1789 FPS)。

Conclusion: 该方法为跨领域深度假写检测设置了新的标杆，通过关注关键局部特征有效提升了检测模型的演化性和稳健性。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of deepfake generation techniques has intensified the
need for robust and generalizable detection methods. Existing approaches based
on reconstruction learning typically leverage deep convolutional networks to
extract differential features. However, these methods show poor generalization
across object categories (e.g., from faces to cars) and generation domains
(e.g., from GANs to Stable Diffusion), due to intrinsic limitations of deep
CNNs. First, models trained on a specific category tend to overfit to semantic
feature distributions, making them less transferable to other categories,
especially as network depth increases. Second, Global Average Pooling (GAP)
compresses critical local forgery cues into a single vector, thus discarding
discriminative patterns vital for real-fake classification. To address these
issues, we propose a novel Local Focus Mechanism (LFM) that explicitly attends
to discriminative local features for differentiating fake from real images. LFM
integrates a Salience Network (SNet) with a task-specific Top-K Pooling (TKP)
module to select the K most informative local patterns. To mitigate potential
overfitting introduced by Top-K pooling, we introduce two regularization
techniques: Rank-Based Linear Dropout (RBLD) and Random-K Sampling (RKS), which
enhance the model's robustness. LFM achieves a 3.7 improvement in accuracy and
a 2.8 increase in average precision over the state-of-the-art Neighboring Pixel
Relationships (NPR) method, while maintaining exceptional efficiency at 1789
FPS on a single NVIDIA A6000 GPU. Our approach sets a new benchmark for
cross-domain deepfake detection. The source code are available in

Abstract: The proliferation of digital food content has intensified the need for robust

retrieval. In this work, we address the challenging task of food image-to-text
matching, a critical component in applications such as dietary monitoring,
smart kitchens, and restaurant automation. We propose F4-ITS: Fine-grained
Feature Fusion for Food Image-Text Search, a training-free, vision-language
model (VLM)-guided framework that significantly improves retrieval performance
through enhanced multi-modal feature representations. Our approach introduces
two key contributions: (1) a uni-directional(and bi-directional) multi-modal
fusion strategy that combines image embeddings with VLM-generated textual
descriptions to improve query expressiveness, and (2) a novel feature-based
re-ranking mechanism for top-k retrieval, leveraging predicted food ingredients
to refine results and boost precision. Leveraging open-source image-text
encoders, we demonstrate substantial gains over standard baselines - achieving
~10% and ~7.7% improvements in top-1 retrieval under dense and sparse caption
scenarios, and a ~28.6% gain in top-k ingredient-level retrieval. Additionally,
we show that smaller models (e.g., ViT-B/32) can match or outperform larger

Abstract: Accurate 3D scene understanding in outdoor environments heavily relies on
high-quality point clouds. However, LiDAR-scanned data often suffer from
extreme sparsity, severely hindering downstream 3D perception tasks. Existing
point cloud upsampling methods primarily focus on individual objects, thus
demonstrating limited generalization capability for complex outdoor scenes. To
address this issue, we propose PVNet, a diffusion model-based point-voxel
interaction framework to perform LiDAR point cloud upsampling without dense
supervision. Specifically, we adopt the classifier-free guidance-based DDPMs to
guide the generation, in which we employ a sparse point cloud as the guiding
condition and the synthesized point clouds derived from its nearby frames as
the input. Moreover, we design a voxel completion module to refine and complete
the coarse voxel features for enriching the feature representation. In
addition, we propose a point-voxel interaction module to integrate features
from both points and voxels, which efficiently improves the environmental
perception capability of each upsampled point. To the best of our knowledge,
our approach is the first scene-level point cloud upsampling method supporting
arbitrary upsampling rates. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. The source

TL;DR: DeltaFlow是一个轻量级3D场景流估计框架，通过Δ方案高效提取时序特征，解决了多帧方法计算成本高的问题，并引入类别平衡损失和实例一致性损失来提升精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统场景流估计方法主要关注两帧输入，忽略了时序信息；而现有的多帧方法随着帧数增加计算成本急剧上升。需要一种既能利用时序信息又计算高效的方法。

Method: 提出DeltaFlow框架：1) 使用Δ方案以最小计算成本提取时序特征；2) 引入类别平衡损失处理类别不平衡问题；3) 使用实例一致性损失确保物体运动一致性。

Result: 在Argoverse 2和Waymo数据集上达到SOTA性能：误差降低22%，推理速度提升2倍，同时展现出强大的跨域泛化能力。

Conclusion: DeltaFlow通过高效的时序特征提取和针对性的损失函数设计，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了场景流估计的精度和泛化性能。

Abstract: Previous dominant methods for scene flow estimation focus mainly on input
from two consecutive frames, neglecting valuable information in the temporal
domain. While recent trends shift towards multi-frame reasoning, they suffer
from rapidly escalating computational costs as the number of frames grows. To
leverage temporal information more efficiently, we propose DeltaFlow
($\Delta$Flow), a lightweight 3D framework that captures motion cues via a
$\Delta$ scheme, extracting temporal features with minimal computational cost,
regardless of the number of frames. Additionally, scene flow estimation faces
challenges such as imbalanced object class distributions and motion
inconsistency. To tackle these issues, we introduce a Category-Balanced Loss to
enhance learning across underrepresented classes and an Instance Consistency
Loss to enforce coherent object motion, improving flow accuracy. Extensive
evaluations on the Argoverse 2 and Waymo datasets show that $\Delta$Flow
achieves state-of-the-art performance with up to 22% lower error and $2\times$
faster inference compared to the next-best multi-frame supervised method, while
also demonstrating a strong cross-domain generalization ability. The code is
open-sourced at https://github.com/Kin-Zhang/DeltaFlow along with trained model

Motivation: 解决动态环境中实时照相级现实渲染的挑战，突破视觉质量与性能的交换关系

Method: 提出REGEN双阶段生成对抗网络框架，先用稳健的非配对图像转换模型生成语义一致的照相实际帧，再转换为简化的配对图像转换任务，使用轻量方法进行训练

Result: 在GTA V中证明框架有效性，视觉效果可比稳健非配对方法，推理速度提升32.14倍，超越了直接训练轻量非配对方法的效果

Conclusion: REGEN框架能够在保持高视觉质量的前提下实现实时照相级现实效果，为游戏实时渲染提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Photorealism is an important aspect of modern video games since it can shape
the player experience and simultaneously impact the immersion, narrative
engagement, and visual fidelity. Although recent hardware technological
breakthroughs, along with state-of-the-art rendering technologies, have
significantly improved the visual realism of video games, achieving true
photorealism in dynamic environments at real-time frame rates still remains a
major challenge due to the tradeoff between visual quality and performance. In
this short paper, we present a novel approach for enhancing the photorealism of
rendered game frames using generative adversarial networks. To this end, we
propose Real-time photorealism Enhancement in Games via a dual-stage gEnerative
Network framework (REGEN), which employs a robust unpaired image-to-image
translation model to produce semantically consistent photorealistic frames that
transform the problem into a simpler paired image-to-image translation task.
This enables training with a lightweight method that can achieve real-time
inference time without compromising visual quality. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our framework on Grand Theft Auto V, showing that the approach
achieves visual results comparable to the ones produced by the robust unpaired
Im2Im method while improving inference speed by 32.14 times. Our findings also
indicate that the results outperform the photorealism-enhanced frames produced
by directly training a lightweight unpaired Im2Im translation method to
translate the video game frames towards the visual characteristics of
real-world images. Code, pre-trained models, and demos for this work are
available at: https://github.com/stefanos50/REGEN.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可控视频生成模型在保持语义一致性方面存在困难，经常生成与提示细节不符的视频内容

Method: 提出两阶段方法：1) 空间信号提示阶段利用预训练多模态模型生成空间感知视觉提示；2) 通过轻量级SSG-Adapter将联合条件注入冻结的视频DiT骨干网络，采用双分支注意力机制

Result: 在VBench基准测试中达到最先进性能，在空间关系控制和整体一致性等关键指标上优于现有模型

Conclusion: SSG-DiT通过空间信号引导和高效的适配器设计，成功解决了可控视频生成中的语义一致性问题，为高质量视频合成提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Controllable video generation aims to synthesize video content that aligns
precisely with user-provided conditions, such as text descriptions and initial
images. However, a significant challenge persists in this domain: existing
models often struggle to maintain strong semantic consistency, frequently
generating videos that deviate from the nuanced details specified in the
prompts. To address this issue, we propose SSG-DiT (Spatial Signal Guided
Diffusion Transformer), a novel and efficient framework for high-fidelity
controllable video generation. Our approach introduces a decoupled two-stage
process. The first stage, Spatial Signal Prompting, generates a spatially aware
visual prompt by leveraging the rich internal representations of a pre-trained
multi-modal model. This prompt, combined with the original text, forms a joint
condition that is then injected into a frozen video DiT backbone via our
lightweight and parameter-efficient SSG-Adapter. This unique design, featuring
a dual-branch attention mechanism, allows the model to simultaneously harness
its powerful generative priors while being precisely steered by external
spatial signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSG-DiT achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing models on multiple key
metrics in the VBench benchmark, particularly in spatial relationship control
and overall consistency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种将Vision Transformer与近端工具结合的新框架，通过几何优化方法增强特征表示和分类性能，解决了ViT只能建模图像局部关系而无法捕捉全局几何关系的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformer虽然通过自注意力机制在计算机视觉任务中取得了显著成功，但其优化仅限于建模单个图像内的局部关系，无法捕捉数据点之间的全局几何关系，这限制了其性能。

Method: 将ViT与近端工具集成，ViT通过自注意力机制构建流形的切丛（每个注意力头对应一个切空间），然后引入近端迭代来定义切丛中的截面并将数据从切空间投影到基空间，实现全局特征对齐和优化。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的方法在分类准确率和数据分布方面都优于传统的ViT模型。

Conclusion: 该框架通过几何优化方法成功增强了ViT的特征表示能力，证明了整合几何工具可以有效提升视觉Transformer的全局关系建模能力。

Abstract: The Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture has become widely recognized in
computer vision, leveraging its self-attention mechanism to achieve remarkable
success across various tasks. Despite its strengths, ViT's optimization remains
confined to modeling local relationships within individual images, limiting its
ability to capture the global geometric relationships between data points. To
address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel framework that integrates
ViT with the proximal tools, enabling a unified geometric optimization approach
to enhance feature representation and classification performance. In this
framework, ViT constructs the tangent bundle of the manifold through its
self-attention mechanism, where each attention head corresponds to a tangent
space, offering geometric representations from diverse local perspectives.
Proximal iterations are then introduced to define sections within the tangent
bundle and project data from tangent spaces onto the base space, achieving
global feature alignment and optimization. Experimental results confirm that
the proposed method outperforms traditional ViT in terms of classification
accuracy and data distribution.

Method: 提出Proxy-Decidability Loss，通过可学习代理估计真实分布和冒名分布，将代理方法的高效性与可决策性指标的统计框架相结合

Result: 在细粒度分类和人脸验证等多个任务上的实验表明，PD-Loss达到了与最先进方法相当的性能

Conclusion: PD-Loss为嵌入优化提供了新的视角，具有更广泛的应用潜力，成功结合了计算效率和分布感知能力

Abstract: Deep Metric Learning (DML) aims to learn embedding functions that map
semantically similar inputs to proximate points in a metric space while
separating dissimilar ones. Existing methods, such as pairwise losses, are
hindered by complex sampling requirements and slow convergence. In contrast,
proxy-based losses, despite their improved scalability, often fail to optimize
global distribution properties. The Decidability-based Loss (D-Loss) addresses
this by targeting the decidability index (d') to enhance distribution
separability, but its reliance on large mini-batches imposes significant
computational constraints. We introduce Proxy-Decidability Loss (PD-Loss), a
novel objective that integrates learnable proxies with the statistical
framework of d' to optimize embedding spaces efficiently. By estimating genuine
and impostor distributions through proxies, PD-Loss combines the computational
efficiency of proxy-based methods with the principled separability of D-Loss,
offering a scalable approach to distribution-aware DML. Experiments across
various tasks, including fine-grained classification and face verification,
demonstrate that PD-Loss achieves performance comparable to that of
state-of-the-art methods while introducing a new perspective on embedding
optimization, with potential for broader applications.

Motivation: 现有MLLM系统需要密集像素监督进行训练，成本高昂且在域外数据上表现不佳，需要一种更高效且泛化能力强的解决方案

Method: 使用多模态大语言模型生成边界框和正点提示，然后输入预训练分割模型生成最终掩码。采用纯强化学习训练（GRPO），仅使用格式奖励和准确性奖励，无需掩码监督

Conclusion: 复杂的地理空间分割行为可以通过强化学习从弱空间线索中学习，该方法利用了基础模型的强先验，最小化了可训练参数，并能从廉价标注中学习

Abstract: Geospatial pixel reasoning is a nascent remote-sensing task that aims to
generate segmentation masks directly from natural-language instructions.
Prevailing MLLM-based systems co-train a language model and a mask decoder with
dense pixel supervision, which is expensive and often weak on out-of-domain
(OOD) data. We introduce GRASP, a structured policy-learning framework. In our
design, a multimodal large language model first emits task-relevant bounding
boxes and positive points from a vision-language instruction. These outputs are
then passed to a pre-trained segmentation model, which consumes them as prompts
to generate the final mask. Instead of supervised fine-tuning, we optimize the
system purely with reinforcement learning: the model is trained solely with
GRPO, guided by format rewards and accuracy rewards computed on boxes and
points (no mask supervision). This leverages strong priors in foundation
models, minimizes trainable parameters, and enables learning from inexpensive
annotations. We additionally curate GRASP-1k, which contains
reasoning-intensive queries, detailed reasoning traces, and fine-grained
segmentation annotations. Evaluations on both in-domain and out-of-domain test
sets show state-of-the-art results: about 4% improvement in-domain and up to
54% on OOD benchmarks. The experiment results evidence our model's robust
generalization and demonstrate that complex geospatial segmentation behaviors
can be learned via RL from weak spatial cues. Code and the dataset will be
released open-source.

Abstract: Despite progress in AI-based plant diagnostics, sugarcane farmers in
low-resource regions remain vulnerable to leaf diseases due to the lack of
scalable, efficient, and interpretable tools. Many deep learning models fail to
generalize under real-world conditions and require substantial computational
resources, limiting their use in resource-constrained regions. In this paper,
we present SugarcaneLD-BD, a curated dataset for sugarcane leaf-disease
classification; SugarcaneShuffleNet, an optimized lightweight model for rapid
on-device diagnosis; and SugarcaneAI, a Progressive Web Application for field
deployment. SugarcaneLD-BD contains 638 curated images across five classes,
including four major sugarcane diseases, collected in Bangladesh under diverse
field conditions and verified by expert pathologists. To enhance diversity, we
combined SugarcaneLD-BD with two additional datasets, yielding a larger and
more representative corpus. Our optimized model, SugarcaneShuffleNet, offers
the best trade-off between speed and accuracy for real-time, on-device
diagnosis. This 9.26 MB model achieved 98.02% accuracy, an F1-score of 0.98,
and an average inference time of 4.14 ms per image. For comparison, we
fine-tuned five other lightweight convolutional neural networks: MnasNet,
EdgeNeXt, EfficientNet-Lite, MobileNet, and SqueezeNet via transfer learning
and Bayesian optimization. MnasNet and EdgeNeXt achieved comparable accuracy to
SugarcaneShuffleNet, but required significantly more parameters, memory, and
computation, limiting their suitability for low-resource deployment. We
integrate SugarcaneShuffleNet into SugarcaneAI, delivering Grad-CAM-based
explanations in the field. Together, these contributions offer a diverse
benchmark, efficient models for low-resource environments, and a practical tool
for sugarcane disease classification. It spans varied lighting, backgrounds and
devices used on-farm

Motivation: 脑肿瘤是致命疾病，早期检测和准确分类对诊疗至关重要。传统CNN和Transformer存在计算成本高、对对比度变化敏感、处理MRI数据结构异质性和纹理不一致等问题。

Method: 开发了四个核心创新：1）平滑边界CNN集成Transformer（SBCIT）；2）定制残差和空间学习CNN；3）通道增强策略；4）新型空间注意力机制。SBCIT采用stem卷积和上下文交互transformer块，结合平滑和边界操作实现高效全局特征建模。

Conclusion: CE-RS-SBCIT框架通过整合局部细粒度和全局上下文信息，有效解决了脑肿瘤MRI分类中的挑战，为计算机辅助诊断系统提供了高性能解决方案。

Abstract: Brain tumors remain among the most lethal human diseases, where early
detection and accurate classification are critical for effective diagnosis and
treatment planning. Although deep learning-based computer-aided diagnostic
(CADx) systems have shown remarkable progress. However, conventional
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers face persistent
challenges, including high computational cost, sensitivity to minor contrast
variations, structural heterogeneity, and texture inconsistencies in MRI data.
Therefore, a novel hybrid framework, CE-RS-SBCIT, is introduced, integrating
residual and spatial learning-based CNNs with transformer-driven modules. The
proposed framework exploits local fine-grained and global contextual cues
through four core innovations: (i) a smoothing and boundary-based
CNN-integrated Transformer (SBCIT), (ii) tailored residual and spatial learning
CNNs, (iii) a channel enhancement (CE) strategy, and (iv) a novel spatial
attention mechanism. The developed SBCIT employs stem convolution and
contextual interaction transformer blocks with systematic smoothing and
boundary operations, enabling efficient global feature modeling. Moreover,
Residual and spatial CNNs, enhanced by auxiliary transfer-learned feature maps,
enrich the representation space, while the CE module amplifies discriminative
channels and mitigates redundancy. Furthermore, the spatial attention mechanism
selectively emphasizes subtle contrast and textural variations across tumor
classes. Extensive evaluation on challenging MRI datasets from Kaggle and
Figshare, encompassing glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors, and healthy
controls, demonstrates superior performance, achieving 98.30% accuracy, 98.08%
sensitivity, 98.25% F1-score, and 98.43% precision.

weakness by leveraging annotated frames instead of raw coordinate data,
significantly improving accuracy in localizing and interpreting video content.

Conclusion: 该方法在不增加图谱标注工作量的情况下提高了AD成像生物标志物的准确性，有助于更精确量化AD与脑萎缩的关系，为疾病追踪提供更准确的测量指标。

Abstract: Imaging biomarkers in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are important tools
for diagnosing and tracking Alzheimer's disease (AD). As medial temporal lobe
(MTL) is the earliest region to show AD-related hallmarks, brain atrophy caused
by AD can first be observed in the MTL. Accurate segmentation of MTL subregions
and extraction of imaging biomarkers from them are important. However, due to
imaging limitations, the resolution of T2-weighted (T2w) MRI is anisotropic,
which makes it difficult to accurately extract the thickness of cortical
subregions in the MTL. In this study, we used an implicit neural representation
method to combine the resolution advantages of T1-weighted and T2w MRI to
accurately upsample an MTL subregion atlas set from anisotropic space to
isotropic space, establishing a multi-modality, high-resolution atlas set.
Based on this atlas, we developed an isotropic MTL subregion segmentation
model. In an independent test set, the cortical subregion thickness extracted
using this isotropic model showed higher significance than an anisotropic
method in distinguishing between participants with mild cognitive impairment
and cognitively unimpaired (CU) participants. In longitudinal analysis, the
biomarkers extracted using isotropic method showed greater stability in CU
participants. This study improved the accuracy of AD imaging biomarkers without
increasing the amount of atlas annotation work, which may help to more
accurately quantify the relationship between AD and brain atrophy and provide
more accurate measures for disease tracking.

Abstract: We introduce VROOM, a system for reconstructing 3D models of Formula 1
circuits using only onboard camera footage from racecars. Leveraging video data
from the 2023 Monaco Grand Prix, we address video challenges such as high-speed
motion and sharp cuts in camera frames. Our pipeline analyzes different methods
such as DROID-SLAM, AnyCam, and Monst3r and combines preprocessing techniques
such as different methods of masking, temporal chunking, and resolution scaling
to account for dynamic motion and computational constraints. We show that Vroom
is able to partially recover track and vehicle trajectories in complex

TL;DR: 提出AdvCP方法解决弱监督变化检测中的背景噪声问题，通过对抗性提示挖掘和样本校正来提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弱监督变化检测(WSCD)仅使用图像级标签，但容易将背景变化误判为目标变化，特别是在复杂遥感场景中

Method: AdvCP包含两个阶段：1)对抗性提示挖掘-使用错误标签激活错误特征映射；2)对抗性样本校正-构建在线全局原型整合样本

Result: 在ConvNet、Transformer和SAM基线上均显示显著性能提升，且可推广到其他多类弱监督密集预测场景

Conclusion: AdvCP能有效解决WSCD中的共现噪声问题，无需增加推理成本，具有良好通用性

Abstract: Weakly-Supervised Change Detection (WSCD) aims to distinguish specific object
changes (e.g., objects appearing or disappearing) from background variations
(e.g., environmental changes due to light, weather, or seasonal shifts) in
paired satellite images, relying only on paired image (i.e., image-level)
classification labels. This technique significantly reduces the need for dense
annotations required in fully-supervised change detection. However, as
image-level supervision only indicates whether objects have changed in a scene,
WSCD methods often misclassify background variations as object changes,
especially in complex remote-sensing scenarios. In this work, we propose an
Adversarial Class Prompting (AdvCP) method to address this co-occurring noise
problem, including two phases: a) Adversarial Prompt Mining: After each
training iteration, we introduce adversarial prompting perturbations, using
incorrect one-hot image-level labels to activate erroneous feature mappings.
This process reveals co-occurring adversarial samples under weak supervision,
namely background variation features that are likely to be misclassified as
object changes. b) Adversarial Sample Rectification: We integrate these
adversarially prompt-activated pixel samples into training by constructing an
online global prototype. This prototype is built from an exponentially weighted
moving average of the current batch and all historical training data. Our AdvCP
can be seamlessly integrated into current WSCD methods without adding
additional inference cost. Experiments on ConvNet, Transformer, and Segment
Anything Model (SAM)-based baselines demonstrate significant performance
enhancements. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generalizability of AdvCP to
other multi-class weakly-supervised dense prediction scenarios. Code is

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的封面图像生成任务，通过多模态伪标注方法构建高质量数据集，能够从纯文本文档生成简洁摘要和对应视觉图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集无法支持同时生成文本摘要和对应视觉图像的任务，需要低成本构建高质量的多模态数据集。

Method: 采用多模态伪标注方法：收集含多图像和标题的文档，排除事实不一致实例；基于黄金摘要对图像和标题分别排序；当图像和对应标题均排名第一时标注伪标签；移除包含直接图像引用的文档。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的多模态伪标注方法比单独考虑标题和图像的文本/图像伪标注方法构建的数据集更精确，生成的图像质量更高。

Conclusion: 多模态伪标注方法能够有效构建高质量的封面图像生成数据集，为同时生成文本摘要和视觉图像的任务提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel cover image generation task that produces
both a concise summary and a visually corresponding image from a given
text-only document. Because no existing datasets are available for this task,
we propose a multimodal pseudo-labeling method to construct high-quality
datasets at low cost. We first collect documents that contain multiple images
with their captions, and their summaries by excluding factually inconsistent
instances. Our approach selects one image from the multiple images accompanying
the documents. Using the gold summary, we independently rank both the images
and their captions. Then, we annotate a pseudo-label for an image when both the
image and its corresponding caption are ranked first in their respective
rankings. Finally, we remove documents that contain direct image references
within texts. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed multimodal
pseudo-labeling method constructs more precise datasets and generates higher
quality images than text- and image-only pseudo-labeling methods, which
consider captions and images separately. We release our code at:

Conclusion: 该研究提出的方法能够有效利用训练期间的多模态数据优势，同时支持推理期仅使用单模态数据，为IHC预测提供了一种成本效益更高的解决方案

Abstract: Immunohistochemical (IHC) biomarker prediction benefits from multi-modal data
fusion analysis. However, the simultaneous acquisition of multi-modal data,
such as genomic and pathological information, is often challenging due to cost
or technical limitations. To address this challenge, we propose an online
distillation approach based on Multi-modal Knowledge Decomposition (MKD) to
enhance IHC biomarker prediction in haematoxylin and eosin (H\&E) stained
histopathology images. This method leverages paired genomic-pathology data
during training while enabling inference using either pathology slides alone or
both modalities. Two teacher and one student models are developed to extract
modality-specific and modality-general features by minimizing the MKD loss. To
maintain the internal structural relationships between samples,
Similarity-preserving Knowledge Distillation (SKD) is applied. Additionally,
Collaborative Learning for Online Distillation (CLOD) facilitates mutual
learning between teacher and student models, encouraging diverse and
complementary learning dynamics. Experiments on the TCGA-BRCA and in-house QHSU
datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance in IHC
biomarker prediction using uni-modal data. Our code is available at

Method: 结合预处理管道和卷积神经网络，在VGG19骨干网络中插入多头自注意力块来建模细胞特征间的长程依赖关系，使用Focal Loss缓解类别不平衡问题

Result: 增强的VGG19+MHSA模型达到99.25%的准确率，优于ResNet101基线模型的98.62%

Conclusion: 注意力增强的CNN结合针对性损失优化和预处理，能够产生更具判别性的白血病细胞形态表征，为临床提供高效准确的自动化诊断工具

Abstract: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a prevalent hematological malignancy in
both pediatric and adult populations. Early and accurate detection with precise
subtyping is essential for guiding therapy. Conventional workflows are complex,
time-consuming, and prone to human error. We present a deep learning framework
for automated ALL diagnosis from bone marrow smear images. The method combines
a robust preprocessing pipeline with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to
standardize image quality and improve inference efficiency. As a key design, we
insert a multi-head self-attention (MHSA) block into a VGG19 backbone to model
long-range dependencies and contextual relationships among cellular features.
To mitigate class imbalance, we train with Focal Loss. Across evaluated
architectures, the enhanced VGG19+MHSA trained with Focal Loss achieves 99.25%
accuracy, surpassing a strong ResNet101 baseline (98.62%). These results
indicate that attention-augmented CNNs, coupled with targeted loss optimization
and preprocessing, yield more discriminative representations of leukemic cell
morphology. Our approach offers a highly accurate and computationally efficient
tool for automated ALL recognition and subtyping, with potential to accelerate
diagnostic workflows and support reliable decision-making in clinical settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉预训练表示主要基于2D图像，忽略了世界的3D本质，但由于大规模3D数据稀缺，难以从网络数据集中提取通用3D表示

Method: 将视觉预训练目标构建为下一个点云预测问题，使用扩散模型作为预测模型，直接在大型公共数据集上进行预训练

Result: 在12个真实世界操作任务中，FVP将3D扩散策略(DP3)的平均成功率提升28%，达到模仿学习方法的最先进性能，并能适配各种点云编码器和数据集

Conclusion: FVP是一个有效的4D视觉预训练框架，能够显著提升3D表示性能，适用于各种机器人任务，包括大规模视觉-语言-动作模型

Abstract: General visual representations learned from web-scale datasets for robotics
have achieved great success in recent years, enabling data-efficient robot
learning on manipulation tasks; yet these pre-trained representations are
mostly on 2D images, neglecting the inherent 3D nature of the world. However,
due to the scarcity of large-scale 3D data, it is still hard to extract a
universal 3D representation from web datasets. Instead, we are seeking a
general visual pre-training framework that could improve all 3D representations
as an alternative. Our framework, called FVP, is a novel 4D Visual Pre-training
framework for real-world robot learning. FVP frames the visual pre-training
objective as a next-point-cloud-prediction problem, models the prediction model
as a diffusion model, and pre-trains the model on the larger public datasets
directly. Across twelve real-world manipulation tasks, FVP boosts the average
success rate of 3D Diffusion Policy (DP3) for these tasks by 28%. The FVP
pre-trained DP3 achieves state-of-the-art performance across imitation learning
methods. Moreover, the efficacy of FVP adapts across various point cloud
encoders and datasets. Finally, we apply FVP to the RDT-1B, a larger
Vision-Language-Action robotic model, enhancing its performance on various
robot tasks. Our project page is available at: https://4d-

TL;DR: PersPose是一个新颖的单目3D人体姿态估计框架，通过引入透视编码(PE)和透视旋转(PR)来解决裁剪图像中相机内参缺失和透视失真的问题，在多个数据集上达到了最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D人体姿态估计方法通常只使用裁剪后的图像作为输入，但缺少相机内参信息导致无法准确估计关节的相对深度。同时，人体主体偏离图像中心会导致透视失真，增加模型拟合难度。

Method: 提出了PersPose框架：1) 透视编码(PE)来编码裁剪图像的相机内参；2) 透视旋转(PR)将人体主体居中，减少透视失真；3) 结合PE和PR构建完整的3D姿态估计框架。

Result: 在3DPW、MPI-INF-3DHP和Human3.6M数据集上达到最先进性能。在3DPW数据集上MPJPE为60.1mm，比之前最佳方法降低了7.54%。

Conclusion: PersPose通过显式处理相机内参和透视失真问题，显著提升了单目3D人体姿态估计的精度，为解决裁剪图像中的几何约束问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation (HPE) methods estimate the 3D positions of
joints from individual images. Existing 3D HPE approaches often use the cropped
image alone as input for their models. However, the relative depths of joints
cannot be accurately estimated from cropped images without the corresponding
camera intrinsics, which determine the perspective relationship between 3D
objects and the cropped images. In this work, we introduce Perspective Encoding
(PE) to encode the camera intrinsics of the cropped images. Moreover, since the
human subject can appear anywhere within the original image, the perspective
relationship between the 3D scene and the cropped image differs significantly,
which complicates model fitting. Additionally, the further the human subject
deviates from the image center, the greater the perspective distortions in the
cropped image. To address these issues, we propose Perspective Rotation (PR), a
transformation applied to the original image that centers the human subject,
thereby reducing perspective distortions and alleviating the difficulty of
model fitting. By incorporating PE and PR, we propose a novel 3D HPE framework,
PersPose. Experimental results demonstrate that PersPose achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the 3DPW, MPIINF-3DHP, and Human3.6M
datasets. For example, on the in-the-wild dataset 3DPW, PersPose achieves an
MPJPE of 60.1 mm, 7.54% lower than the previous SOTA approach. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoViPAL是一种层级的上下文视觉token剪枝方法，通过轻量级即插即用模块在LVLM处理前预测和移除冗余视觉token，显著提升推理效率而不损失精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型处理图像时产生大量视觉token，导致计算成本高和内存开销大。现有方法在浅层剪枝效果不佳，但许多视觉token在浅层就具有固有冗余性。

Method: 提出CoViPAL方法，使用即插即用剪枝模块(PPM)在LVLM处理前进行层级上下文视觉token剪枝。PPM轻量级、模型无关，可无缝集成到各种模型中。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，CoViPAL在相同token预算下优于无训练剪枝方法，在可比监督下超越基于训练的方法，显著提升推理效率。

Conclusion: CoViPAL为LVLM提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案，在不影响准确性的前提下显著改善推理效率。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) process multimodal inputs consisting of
text tokens and vision tokens extracted from images or videos. Due to the rich
visual information, a single image can generate thousands of vision tokens,
leading to high computational costs during the prefilling stage and significant
memory overhead during decoding. Existing methods attempt to prune redundant
vision tokens, revealing substantial redundancy in visual representations.
However, these methods often struggle in shallow layers due to the lack of
sufficient contextual information. We argue that many visual tokens are
inherently redundant even in shallow layers and can be safely and effectively
pruned with appropriate contextual signals. In this work, we propose CoViPAL, a
layer-wise contextualized visual token pruning method that employs a
Plug-and-Play Pruning Module (PPM) to predict and remove redundant vision
tokens before they are processed by the LVLM. The PPM is lightweight,
model-agnostic, and operates independently of the LVLM architecture, ensuring
seamless integration with various models. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that CoViPAL outperforms training-free pruning methods
under equal token budgets and surpasses training-based methods with comparable
supervision. CoViPAL offers a scalable and efficient solution to improve
inference efficiency in LVLMs without compromising accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文首次定义了多重嵌入攻击(MEA)并提出了对抗干扰模拟(AIS)训练范式，通过在微调时显式模拟MEA场景和引入弹性驱动的损失函数，使现有水印方法能够抵御多重嵌入攻击，保持原始水印的提取能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度伪造技术的快速发展和数字媒体的广泛传播，个人隐私面临严重安全威胁。现有的深度伪造主动取证方法依赖于单一水印嵌入的理想化假设，但在现实场景中，受保护图像可能经历多次水印嵌入，导致原始取证水印被破坏或移除，使整个主动取证机制失效。

Method: 提出了对抗干扰模拟(AIS)通用训练范式，不修改网络架构，而是在微调过程中显式模拟多重嵌入攻击(MEA)场景，引入弹性驱动的损失函数来强制学习稀疏且稳定的水印表示，使模型即使在第二次嵌入后仍能正确提取原始水印。

Result: 大量实验表明，AIS训练范式显著增强了各种现有方法对MEA的鲁棒性，证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: AIS是一种即插即用的训练范式，能够有效解决多重嵌入攻击带来的安全漏洞，提升深度伪造主动取证系统的实际应用可靠性。

Abstract: With the rapid evolution of deepfake technologies and the wide dissemination
of digital media, personal privacy is facing increasingly serious security
threats. Deepfake proactive forensics, which involves embedding imperceptible
watermarks to enable reliable source tracking, serves as a crucial defense
against these threats. Although existing methods show strong forensic ability,
they rely on an idealized assumption of single watermark embedding, which
proves impractical in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we formally define
and demonstrate the existence of Multi-Embedding Attacks (MEA) for the first
time. When a previously protected image undergoes additional rounds of
watermark embedding, the original forensic watermark can be destroyed or
removed, rendering the entire proactive forensic mechanism ineffective. To
address this vulnerability, we propose a general training paradigm named
Adversarial Interference Simulation (AIS). Rather than modifying the network
architecture, AIS explicitly simulates MEA scenarios during fine-tuning and
introduces a resilience-driven loss function to enforce the learning of sparse
and stable watermark representations. Our method enables the model to maintain
the ability to extract the original watermark correctly even after a second
embedding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our plug-and-play AIS
training paradigm significantly enhances the robustness of various existing
methods against MEA.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度神经网络在真实任务中表现优异，但无法像人类一样感知错觉轮廓（如abutting grating），这种感知差异阻碍了机器智能与人类认知的对齐。

Method: 受视觉皮层回路启发，设计ICPNet网络：1）多尺度特征投影模块提取多尺度表征；2）特征交互注意力模块增强前馈和反馈特征交互；3）边缘融合模块通过边缘检测任务注入形状约束，引导网络关注前景。

Result: 在AG-MNIST和新建的AG-Fashion-MNIST测试集上，ICPNet对错觉轮廓的敏感性显著优于最先进模型，在各种子集上的top-1准确率都有显著提升。

Conclusion: 该工作向基于DNN的模型实现人类水平智能迈出了重要一步，解决了DNN与人类感知模式不对齐的问题。

Abstract: Higher levels of machine intelligence demand alignment with human perception
and cognition. Deep neural networks (DNN) dominated machine intelligence have
demonstrated exceptional performance across various real-world tasks.
Nevertheless, recent evidence suggests that DNNs fail to perceive illusory
contours like the abutting grating, a discrepancy that misaligns with human
perception patterns. Departing from previous works, we propose a novel deep
network called illusory contour perception network (ICPNet) inspired by the
circuits of the visual cortex. In ICPNet, a multi-scale feature projection
(MFP) module is designed to extract multi-scale representations. To boost the
interaction between feedforward and feedback features, a feature interaction
attention module (FIAM) is introduced. Moreover, drawing inspiration from the
shape bias observed in human perception, an edge detection task conducted via
the edge fusion module (EFM) injects shape constraints that guide the network
to concentrate on the foreground. We assess our method on the existing AG-MNIST
test set and the AG-Fashion-MNIST test sets constructed by this work.
Comprehensive experimental results reveal that ICPNet is significantly more
sensitive to abutting grating illusory contours than state-of-the-art models,
with notable improvements in top-1 accuracy across various subsets. This work
is expected to make a step towards human-level intelligence for DNN-based
models.

Abstract: We present SEER-VAR, a novel framework for egocentric vehicle-based augmented

(CASB), and LLM-driven recommendation. Unlike existing systems that assume
static or single-view settings, SEER-VAR dynamically separates cabin and road
scenes via depth-guided vision-language grounding. Two SLAM branches track
egocentric motion in each context, while a GPT-based module generates
context-aware overlays such as dashboard cues and hazard alerts. To support
evaluation, we introduce EgoSLAM-Drive, a real-world dataset featuring
synchronized egocentric views, 6DoF ground-truth poses, and AR annotations
across diverse driving scenarios. Experiments demonstrate that SEER-VAR
achieves robust spatial alignment and perceptually coherent AR rendering across
varied environments. As one of the first to explore LLM-based AR recommendation
in egocentric driving, we address the lack of comparable systems through
structured prompting and detailed user studies. Results show that SEER-VAR
enhances perceived scene understanding, overlay relevance, and driver ease,
providing an effective foundation for future research in this direction. Code

Abstract: Identifying quantum flakes is crucial for scalable quantum hardware; however,
automated layer classification from optical microscopy remains challenging due
to substantial appearance shifts across different materials. In this paper, we
propose a new Continual-Learning Framework for Flake Layer Classification
(CLIFF). To our knowledge, this is the first systematic study of continual
learning in the domain of two-dimensional (2D) materials. Our method enables
the model to differentiate between materials and their physical and optical
properties by freezing a backbone and base head trained on a reference
material. For each new material, it learns a material-specific prompt,
embedding, and a delta head. A prompt pool and a cosine-similarity gate
modulate features and compute material-specific corrections. Additionally, we
incorporate memory replay with knowledge distillation. CLIFF achieves
competitive accuracy with significantly lower forgetting than naive fine-tuning
and a prompt-based baseline.

previous works focus on using a small, learnable teacher (guide) model to
improve the robustness of a student model. Since a learnable guide model starts
learning from scratch, maintaining its optimal state for effective knowledge
transfer during co-training is challenging. Therefore, we propose a novel
Adaptive Guidance Adversarial Training (AdaGAT) method. Our method, AdaGAT,
dynamically adjusts the training state of the guide model to install robustness
to the target model. Specifically, we develop two separate loss functions as
part of the AdaGAT method, allowing the guide model to participate more
actively in backpropagation to achieve its optimal state. We evaluated our
approach via extensive experiments on three datasets: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and
TinyImageNet, using the WideResNet-34-10 model as the target model. Our
observations reveal that appropriately adjusting the guide model within a
certain accuracy range enhances the target model's robustness across various
adversarial attacks compared to a variety of baseline models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人-物交互对于以人为中心的视频内容理解至关重要，现有方法无法同时处理细粒度交互识别和时空轨迹检测

Method: 提出包含目标轨迹检测模块和交互推理模块的新方法，能够同时检测人-物交互类型和跟踪其时空轨迹

Result: 实验结果表明该方法优于基于图像人-物交互检测、视频视觉关系检测和视频人-物交互识别的最先进方法生成的基线

Conclusion: ST-HOID任务具有重要意义，提出的方法在该任务上表现优异，VidOR-HOID数据集为后续研究提供了重要基准

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new instance-level human-object interaction
detection task on videos called ST-HOID, which aims to distinguish fine-grained
human-object interactions (HOIs) and the trajectories of subjects and objects.
It is motivated by the fact that HOI is crucial for human-centric video content
understanding. To solve ST-HOID, we propose a novel method consisting of an
object trajectory detection module and an interaction reasoning module.
Furthermore, we construct the first dataset named VidOR-HOID for ST-HOID
evaluation, which contains 10,831 spatial-temporal HOI instances. We conduct
extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our method. The
experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the baselines
generated by the state-of-the-art methods of image human-object interaction
detection, video visual relation detection and video human-object interaction
recognition.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于深度学习的自动化方法，用于通过CT图像测量肌肉面积来评估肌少症，减轻临床工作负担并提高检测效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肌少症与所治疗效果不佳相关，但目前的手动测量肌肉面积方法耗时耗力，限制了及时检测和管理。需要更高效的自动化方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 采用转移学习和自监督学习方法，利用标注和未标注的CT扫描数据集进行模型训练。重点关注第三腰柱椎位置的肌肉面积定量评估，而非质性检测。

Result: 模型预测肌肉面积的平均误差为±3%，预测分割掩码的平均Dice相似系数达到93%，显示出高精度的自动化测量能力。

Conclusion: 该研究为肌少症评估和检测的全自动化提供了可行路径，能够有效解决数据不平衡和数据有限性问题，为临床应用推广奠定基础。

Abstract: Sarcopenia is a progressive loss of muscle mass and function linked to poor
surgical outcomes such as prolonged hospital stays, impaired mobility, and
increased mortality. Although it can be assessed through cross-sectional
imaging by measuring skeletal muscle area (SMA), the process is time-consuming
and adds to clinical workloads, limiting timely detection and management;
however, this process could become more efficient and scalable with the
assistance of artificial intelligence applications. This paper presents
high-quality three-dimensional cross-sectional computed tomography (CT) images
of patients with sarcopenia collected at the Freeman Hospital, Newcastle upon
Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. Expert clinicians manually annotated the
SMA at the third lumbar vertebra, generating precise segmentation masks. We
develop deep-learning models to measure SMA in CT images and automate this
task. Our methodology employed transfer learning and self-supervised learning
approaches using labelled and unlabeled CT scan datasets. While we developed
qualitative assessment models for detecting sarcopenia, we observed that the
quantitative assessment of SMA is more precise and informative. This approach
also mitigates the issue of class imbalance and limited data availability. Our
model predicted the SMA, on average, with an error of +-3 percentage points
against the manually measured SMA. The average dice similarity coefficient of
the predicted masks was 93%. Our results, therefore, show a pathway to full
automation of sarcopenia assessment and detection.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer的多模态感知跟踪器MTNet，通过模态感知网络和Transformer融合网络来增强RGB-T跟踪的特征交互能力，实现了在三个基准测试上的优异性能和实时速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 常规的融合范式和固定跟踪模板限制了RGB-T跟踪中的特征交互能力，需要更有效的多模态表示学习方法。

Method: 提出MTNet跟踪器，包含模态感知网络（CADM通道聚合分布模块和SSPM空间相似性感知模块）、Transformer融合网络、三叉戟预测头和动态更新策略。

Result: 在三个RGBT基准测试上取得了令人满意的结果，达到了与最先进方法相当的性能，同时实现了实时速度。

Conclusion: 该方法通过模态感知和Transformer融合有效提升了RGB-T跟踪的性能，证明了所提出组件在特征交互和模板维护方面的有效性。

Abstract: The ability to learn robust multi-modality representation has played a
critical role in the development of RGBT tracking. However, the regular fusion
paradigm and the invariable tracking template remain restrictive to the feature
interaction. In this paper, we propose a modality-aware tracker based on
transformer, termed MTNet. Specifically, a modality-aware network is presented
to explore modality-specific cues, which contains both channel aggregation and
distribution module(CADM) and spatial similarity perception module (SSPM). A
transformer fusion network is then applied to capture global dependencies to
reinforce instance representations. To estimate the precise location and tackle
the challenges, such as scale variation and deformation, we design a trident
prediction head and a dynamic update strategy which jointly maintain a reliable
template for facilitating inter-frame communication. Extensive experiments
validate that the proposed method achieves satisfactory results compared with
the state-of-the-art competitors on three RGBT benchmarks while reaching
real-time speed.

Conclusion: 研究证明了元学习在自动化模型适应专门分割任务方面的巨大潜力

Abstract: Foundation models like SAM (Segment Anything Model) exhibit strong zero-shot
image segmentation performance, but often fall short on domain-specific tasks.
Fine-tuning these models typically requires significant manual effort and
domain expertise. In this work, we introduce QTT-SEG, a meta-learning-driven
approach for automating and accelerating the fine-tuning of SAM for image
segmentation. Built on the Quick-Tune hyperparameter optimization framework,
QTT-SEG predicts high-performing configurations using meta-learned cost and
performance models, efficiently navigating a search space of over 200 million
possibilities. We evaluate QTT-SEG on eight binary and five multiclass
segmentation datasets under tight time constraints. Our results show that
QTT-SEG consistently improves upon SAM's zero-shot performance and surpasses
AutoGluon Multimodal, a strong AutoML baseline, on most binary tasks within
three minutes. On multiclass datasets, QTT-SEG delivers consistent gains as
well. These findings highlight the promise of meta-learning in automating model
adaptation for specialized segmentation tasks. Code available at:

Abstract: Compositional visual reasoning has emerged as a key research frontier in
multimodal AI, aiming to endow machines with the human-like ability to
decompose visual scenes, ground intermediate concepts, and perform multi-step
logical inference. While early surveys focus on monolithic vision-language
models or general multimodal reasoning, a dedicated synthesis of the rapidly
expanding compositional visual reasoning literature is still missing. We fill
this gap with a comprehensive survey spanning 2023 to 2025 that systematically
reviews 260+ papers from top venues (CVPR, ICCV, NeurIPS, ICML, ACL, etc.). We
first formalize core definitions and describe why compositional approaches
offer advantages in cognitive alignment, semantic fidelity, robustness,
interpretability, and data efficiency. Next, we trace a five-stage paradigm
shift: from prompt-enhanced language-centric pipelines, through tool-enhanced
LLMs and tool-enhanced VLMs, to recently minted chain-of-thought reasoning and
unified agentic VLMs, highlighting their architectural designs, strengths, and
limitations. We then catalog 60+ benchmarks and corresponding metrics that
probe compositional visual reasoning along dimensions such as grounding
accuracy, chain-of-thought faithfulness, and high-resolution perception.
Drawing on these analyses, we distill key insights, identify open challenges
(e.g., limitations of LLM-based reasoning, hallucination, a bias toward
deductive reasoning, scalable supervision, tool integration, and benchmark
limitations), and outline future directions, including world-model integration,
human-AI collaborative reasoning, and richer evaluation protocols. By offering
a unified taxonomy, historical roadmap, and critical outlook, this survey aims
to serve as a foundational reference and inspire the next generation of
compositional visual reasoning research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FoundDiff是一个基础扩散模型，通过两阶段策略实现跨剂量水平和解剖区域的统一低剂量CT去噪，包括剂量-解剖感知对比学习和自适应扩散去噪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法通常在特定剂量水平和解剖区域训练，难以处理不同扫描条件下的噪声特征和解剖异质性，限制了在临床场景中的泛化性和鲁棒性。

Method: 采用两阶段策略：1) 剂量-解剖感知对比学习模型(DA-CLIP)学习连续表示量化剂量变化和识别解剖区域；2) 剂量-解剖感知扩散模型(DA-Diff)通过新型条件块集成学习到的嵌入进行自适应去噪。

Result: 在两个公共LDCT数据集上的广泛实验表明，FoundDiff在八个剂量水平和三个解剖区域上优于现有最先进方法，并对未见剂量水平表现出显著泛化能力。

Conclusion: FoundDiff提供了一个统一且可泛化的低剂量CT去噪解决方案，通过创新的剂量-解剖感知机制显著提升了模型在多样化临床场景中的性能表现。

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (CT) denoising is crucial for reduced radiation
exposure while ensuring diagnostically acceptable image quality. Despite
significant advancements driven by deep learning (DL) in recent years, existing
DL-based methods, typically trained on a specific dose level and anatomical
region, struggle to handle diverse noise characteristics and anatomical
heterogeneity during varied scanning conditions, limiting their
generalizability and robustness in clinical scenarios. In this paper, we
propose FoundDiff, a foundational diffusion model for unified and generalizable
LDCT denoising across various dose levels and anatomical regions. FoundDiff
employs a two-stage strategy: (i) dose-anatomy perception and (ii) adaptive
denoising. First, we develop a dose- and anatomy-aware contrastive language
image pre-training model (DA-CLIP) to achieve robust dose and anatomy
perception by leveraging specialized contrastive learning strategies to learn
continuous representations that quantify ordinal dose variations and identify
salient anatomical regions. Second, we design a dose- and anatomy-aware
diffusion model (DA-Diff) to perform adaptive and generalizable denoising by
synergistically integrating the learned dose and anatomy embeddings from DACLIP
into diffusion process via a novel dose and anatomy conditional block (DACB)
based on Mamba. Extensive experiments on two public LDCT datasets encompassing
eight dose levels and three anatomical regions demonstrate superior denoising
performance of FoundDiff over existing state-of-the-art methods and the
remarkable generalization to unseen dose levels. The codes and models are
available at https://github.com/hao1635/FoundDiff.

Motivation: 随着生成模型规模扩大，训练成本急剧增加，需要开发无需训练且可扩展的图像编辑框架来实现定制化对象的精准插入

Method: 采用位置嵌入移植技术引导扩散模型复制参考对象的结构特征，结合角点中心布局将参考图像与背景图像拼接输入FLUX.1-Fill模型，在渐进去噪过程中指导目标区域噪声分布

Result: 大量实验表明PosBridge在结构一致性、外观保真度和计算效率方面均优于主流基线方法

Conclusion: PosBridge框架具有实用价值和广泛应用的潜力，为无需训练的定制化对象插入提供了高效灵活的解决方案

Abstract: Localized subject-driven image editing aims to seamlessly integrate
user-specified objects into target scenes. As generative models continue to
scale, training becomes increasingly costly in terms of memory and computation,
highlighting the need for training-free and scalable editing frameworks.To this
end, we propose PosBridge an efficient and flexible framework for inserting
custom objects. A key component of our method is positional embedding
transplant, which guides the diffusion model to faithfully replicate the
structural characteristics of reference objects.Meanwhile, we introduce the
Corner Centered Layout, which concatenates reference images and the background
image as input to the FLUX.1-Fill model. During progressive denoising,
positional embedding transplant is applied to guide the noise distribution in
the target region toward that of the reference object. In this way, Corner
Centered Layout effectively directs the FLUX.1-Fill model to synthesize
identity-consistent content at the desired location. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PosBridge outperforms mainstream baselines in structural
consistency, appearance fidelity, and computational efficiency, showcasing its
practical value and potential for broad adoption.

<details>

Motivation: 当前分割竞赛中大多数技巧已被现有代码库集成，基线模型性能已足够好。通过可视化分析发现小麦茎秆具有细粒度结构和像素稀少的特点，容易受到预测不稳定和类别不平衡的影响，因此需要针对茎秆特性进行专门优化。

Method: 1) 使用动态上采样器SAPA增强细节描绘；2) 采用半监督引导蒸馏配合茎秆感知样本选择挖掘未标注数据价值；3) 应用测试时缩放策略对图像进行两次放大分割。

Result: 该方法在竞赛中获得第一名，明显优于第二名，证明了针对特定问题本质进行定制化改进的有效性。

Conclusion: 在现有分割技术趋于成熟的背景下，针对具体问题的本质特性进行专门优化是取得竞争优势的关键，特别是对于像小麦茎秆这样具有挑战性的细粒度结构。

Abstract: In this report, we present our solution during the participation of the MLCAS
2025 GWFSS Challenge. This challenge hosts a semantic segmentation competition
specific to wheat plants, which requires to segment three wheat organs
including the head, leaf, and stem, and another background class. In 2025,
participating a segmentation competition is significantly different from that
in previous years where many tricks can play important roles. Nowadays most
segmentation tricks have been well integrated into existing codebases such that
our naive ViT-Adapter baseline has already achieved sufficiently good
performance. Hence, we believe the key to stand out among other competitors is
to focus on the problem nature of wheat per se. By probing visualizations, we
identify the key -- the stem matters. In contrast to heads and leaves, stems
exhibit fine structure and occupy only few pixels, which suffers from fragile
predictions and class imbalance. Building on our baseline, we present three
technical improvements tailored to stems: i) incorporating a dynamic upsampler
SAPA used to enhance detail delineation; ii) leveraging semi-supervised guided
distillation with stem-aware sample selection to mine the treasure beneath
unlabeled data; and iii) applying a test-time scaling strategy to zoom in and
segment twice the image. Despite being simple, the three improvements bring us
to the first place of the competition, outperforming the second place by clear
margins. Code and models will be released at

Motivation: Deepfake技术的快速发展对社会信任和信息安全构成严重威胁。现有检测方法主要依赖被动分析，难以应对高质量Deepfake内容，因此需要主动防御策略

Method: 提出纹理引导的扰动框架：1) 使用局部二值模式(LBP)提取初步纹理特征；2) 引入双模型注意力策略生成和优化纹理扰动；3) 在低感知显著性的纹理区域插入不可见扰动，避免在平滑区域产生噪声

Conclusion: 该方法为主动Deepfake检测提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案，通过在纹理区域插入针对性扰动来主动防御Deepfake攻击

Abstract: The rapid development of Deepfake technology poses severe challenges to
social trust and information security. While most existing detection methods
primarily rely on passive analyses, due to unresolvable high-quality Deepfake
contents, proactive defense has recently emerged by inserting invisible signals
in advance of image editing. In this paper, we introduce a proactive Deepfake
detection approach based on facial texture features. Since human eyes are more
sensitive to perturbations in smooth regions, we invisibly insert perturbations
within texture regions that have low perceptual saliency, applying localized
perturbations to key texture regions while minimizing unwanted noise in
non-textured areas. Our texture-guided perturbation framework first extracts
preliminary texture features via Local Binary Patterns (LBP), and then
introduces a dual-model attention strategy to generate and optimize texture
perturbations. Experiments on CelebA-HQ and LFW datasets demonstrate the
promising performance of our method in distorting Deepfake generation and
producing obvious visual defects under multiple attack models, providing an
efficient and scalable solution for proactive Deepfake detection.

Motivation: 传统光谱提升方法只能将RGB图像转换为光谱图像，而SpecGen旨在从单张RGB图像生成光谱双向反射分布函数(BRDF)，实现任意光照和形状下的光谱图像渲染。主要挑战是测量光谱BRDF数据的稀缺性。

Method: 提出Spectral-Spatial Tri-plane Aggregation (SSTA)网络，建模波长和入射-出射方向的反射响应，利用丰富的RGB BRDF数据训练策略来增强光谱BRDF生成。

Result: 实验表明该方法能从有限光谱数据准确重建光谱BRDF，在超光谱图像重建方面超越最先进方法，PSNR提升8dB。

Conclusion: SpecGen方法成功解决了光谱BRDF数据稀缺的问题，通过创新的SSTA网络和训练策略实现了高质量的光谱BRDF生成和图像渲染。

Abstract: Synthesizing spectral images across different wavelengths is essential for
photorealistic rendering. Unlike conventional spectral uplifting methods that
convert RGB images into spectral ones, we introduce SpecGen, a novel method
that generates spectral bidirectional reflectance distribution functions
(BRDFs) from a single RGB image of a sphere. This enables spectral image
rendering under arbitrary illuminations and shapes covered by the corresponding
material. A key challenge in spectral BRDF generation is the scarcity of
measured spectral BRDF data. To address this, we propose the Spectral-Spatial
Tri-plane Aggregation (SSTA) network, which models reflectance responses across
wavelengths and incident-outgoing directions, allowing the training strategy to
leverage abundant RGB BRDF data to enhance spectral BRDF generation.
Experiments show that our method accurately reconstructs spectral BRDFs from
limited spectral data and surpasses state-of-the-art methods in hyperspectral
image reconstruction, achieving an improvement of 8 dB in PSNR. Codes and data
will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: We introduce MMCRICBENCH-3K, a benchmark for Visual Question Answering (VQA)
on cricket scorecards, designed to evaluate large vision-language models

show that even state-of-the-art LVLMs, such as GPT-4o and Qwen2.5VL, struggle
on the English subset despite it being their primary training language and

Conclusion: HiDA-Net通过保留原生分辨率细节和明确解耦压缩噪声，有效解决了高分辨率AI生成图像检测的挑战

Abstract: The rapid growth of high-resolution, meticulously crafted AI-generated images
poses a significant challenge to existing detection methods, which are often
trained and evaluated on low-resolution, automatically generated datasets that
do not align with the complexities of high-resolution scenarios. A common
practice is to resize or center-crop high-resolution images to fit standard
network inputs. However, without full coverage of all pixels, such strategies
risk either obscuring subtle, high-frequency artifacts or discarding
information from uncovered regions, leading to input information loss. In this
paper, we introduce the High-Resolution Detail-Aggregation Network (HiDA-Net),
a novel framework that ensures no pixel is left behind. We use the Feature
Aggregation Module (FAM), which fuses features from multiple full-resolution
local tiles with a down-sampled global view of the image. These local features
are aggregated and fused with global representations for final prediction,
ensuring that native-resolution details are preserved and utilized for
detection. To enhance robustness against challenges such as localized AI
manipulations and compression, we introduce Token-wise Forgery Localization
(TFL) module for fine-grained spatial sensitivity and JPEG Quality Factor
Estimation (QFE) module to disentangle generative artifacts from compression
noise explicitly. Furthermore, to facilitate future research, we introduce
HiRes-50K, a new challenging benchmark consisting of 50,568 images with up to
64 megapixels. Extensive experiments show that HiDA-Net achieves
state-of-the-art, increasing accuracy by over 13% on the challenging Chameleon

use cache", typically relying on predefined empirical laws or dataset-level
priors to determine the timing of caching and utilizing handcrafted rules for
leveraging multi-step caches. However, given the highly dynamic nature of the
diffusion process, they often exhibit limited generalizability and fail on
outlier samples. In this paper, a strong correlation is revealed between the
variation patterns of the shallow-layer feature differences in the diffusion
model and those of final model outputs. Moreover, we have observed that the
features from different model layers form similar trajectories. Based on these
observations, we present DiCache, a novel training-free adaptive caching
strategy for accelerating diffusion models at runtime, answering both when and
how to cache within a unified framework. Specifically, DiCache is composed of
two principal components: (1) Online Probe Profiling Scheme leverages a
shallow-layer online probe to obtain a stable prior for the caching error in
real time, enabling the model to autonomously determine caching schedules. (2)
Dynamic Cache Trajectory Alignment combines multi-step caches based on
shallow-layer probe feature trajectory to better approximate the current
feature, facilitating higher visual quality. Extensive experiments validate
DiCache's capability in achieving higher efficiency and improved visual
fidelity over state-of-the-art methods on various leading diffusion models
including WAN 2.1, HunyuanVideo for video generation, and Flux for image
generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像生成方法为每种条件类型训练独立控制分支，导致模型结构冗余和计算资源低效使用，需要统一的框架来支持多样化条件输入。

Method: 提出Condition Modulated Expert (CoMoE)模块聚合语义相似的patch特征并分配给专家模块，以及WeaveNet动态连接机制实现主干网络和条件分支的有效交互。

Result: 在Subjects-200K和MultiGen-20M数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在各种条件图像生成任务中始终达到最先进的性能。

Conclusion: UniGen框架通过创新的CoMoE和WeaveNet设计，有效解决了多条件图像生成中的特征纠缠和计算冗余问题，展现了优异的泛化能力和效率。

Abstract: The image-to-image generation task aims to produce controllable images by
leveraging conditional inputs and prompt instructions. However, existing
methods often train separate control branches for each type of condition,
leading to redundant model structures and inefficient use of computational
resources. To address this, we propose a Unified image-to-image Generation
(UniGen) framework that supports diverse conditional inputs while enhancing
generation efficiency and expressiveness. Specifically, to tackle the widely
existing parameter redundancy and computational inefficiency in controllable
conditional generation architectures, we propose the Condition Modulated Expert
(CoMoE) module. This module aggregates semantically similar patch features and
assigns them to dedicated expert modules for visual representation and
conditional modeling. By enabling independent modeling of foreground features
under different conditions, CoMoE effectively mitigates feature entanglement
and redundant computation in multi-condition scenarios. Furthermore, to bridge
the information gap between the backbone and control branches, we propose
WeaveNet, a dynamic, snake-like connection mechanism that enables effective
interaction between global text-level control from the backbone and
fine-grained control from conditional branches. Extensive experiments on the
Subjects-200K and MultiGen-20M datasets across various conditional image
generation tasks demonstrate that our method consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance, validating its advantages in both versatility and
effectiveness. The code has been uploaded to

*Nir Mazor,Tom Hope*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种联合优化多模态检索器和LVLM的医疗诊断模型，相比标准RAG方法能显著提升在具有挑战性病例上的表现，但距离oracle性能仍有较大差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床决策需要解读医学图像进行诊断，从医学文献和医院记录中检索相关视觉信息可以提高诊断准确性。标准RAG方法中LVLM的错误信号无法传播到检索器，因此需要联合优化。

Method: 开发了一个联合优化多模态检索器和LVLM的模型，仅使用通用骨干网络进行轻量级微调，在临床多标签分类和视觉问答任务上进行评估。

Result: 模型在多个任务上达到与医学预训练模型竞争的结果，联合检索优化显著改善了具有挑战性的病例表现，但距离oracle性能仍有很大差距。

Conclusion: 联合检索优化方法有效，但当前方法仍无法充分利用检索到的信息，未来方法有较大改进空间，特别是在提升检索质量方面。

Abstract: Clinical decision-making often involves interpreting images (e.g., radiology)
for making diagnoses. Retrieving relevant visual information from medical
literature and hospital records could enhance diagnostic accuracy. In this
paper, we develop a model in which a multimodal retriever is jointly optimized
with an LVLM for medical diagnosis, unlike standard RAG where LVLM error signal
is not propagated down to the retriever. We show that using only
general-purpose backbones, with only lightweight fine-tuning, our model is able
to achieve competitive results with medically-pretrained models across clinical
multi-label classification and visual question answering tasks. In a novel
analysis, we additionally find that in many cases different top retrieved
images each lead to different predictions for a given target, and that these
cases are empirically challenging for all models, even for non-retrieval
models. Our joint retrieval optimization significantly improves these
challenging cases over standard RAG. However, oracle analysis reveals that
while the correct diagnosis is frequently achievable using one of the top
retrieved images, in practice there is a large performance gap from the oracle,
and rerankers using frontier LVLMs do not close this gap -- leaving ample room
for improvement by future methods. Code will be made publicly available.

Motivation: 现有视频生成模型过于关注外观保真度，导致人体运动不真实且结构不连贯，同时现有数据集主要关注面部或上半身运动，限制了复杂动作的生成能力

Method: 提出两阶段方法：首先使用高效的3D结构生成器从文本提示生成人体运动序列，然后在生成的结构序列指导下合成视频外观。引入Human-Aware Dynamic Control模块和密集跟踪约束来改进稀疏人体结构的细粒度控制

Result: MoCo在生成真实且结构连贯的人体视频方面优于现有方法，特别是在全身复杂动作生成上表现突出

Conclusion: 通过结构-外观解耦的方法和专门构建的大规模全身人体视频数据集，MoCo成功解决了人体视频生成中的运动一致性和结构连贯性问题

Abstract: Generating human videos with consistent motion from text prompts remains a
significant challenge, particularly for whole-body or long-range motion.
Existing video generation models prioritize appearance fidelity, resulting in
unrealistic or physically implausible human movements with poor structural
coherence. Additionally, most existing human video datasets primarily focus on
facial or upper-body motions, or consist of vertically oriented dance videos,
limiting the scope of corresponding generation methods to simple movements. To
overcome these challenges, we propose MoCo, which decouples the process of
human video generation into two components: structure generation and appearance
generation. Specifically, our method first employs an efficient 3D structure
generator to produce a human motion sequence from a text prompt. The remaining
video appearance is then synthesized under the guidance of the generated
structural sequence. To improve fine-grained control over sparse human
structures, we introduce Human-Aware Dynamic Control modules and integrate
dense tracking constraints during training. Furthermore, recognizing the
limitations of existing datasets, we construct a large-scale whole-body human
video dataset featuring complex and diverse motions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MoCo outperforms existing approaches in generating realistic
and structurally coherent human videos.

Motivation: 解决SAM模型在贝叶斯适应中的三个关键问题：大型预训练模型贝叶斯微调的不稳定性、海量参数带来的高计算成本、以及黑盒设计限制的可解释性。

Method: 结合Token-wise变分贝叶斯推理(T-VBI)进行高效贝叶斯适应，以及自优化Kolmogorov-Arnold网络(SO-KAN)提升可解释性。T-VBI将输出token重新解释为动态概率权重，SO-KAN通过自监督学习改进token预测。

Conclusion: E-BayesSAM统一了效率、可靠性和可解释性，将SAM的多功能性与临床需求相结合，推动了在安全关键医疗应用中的部署。

Abstract: Although the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has advanced medical image
segmentation, its Bayesian adaptation for uncertainty-aware segmentation
remains hindered by three key issues: (1) instability in Bayesian fine-tuning
of large pre-trained SAMs; (2) high computation cost due to SAM's massive
parameters; (3) SAM's black-box design limits interpretability. To overcome
these, we propose E-BayesSAM, an efficient framework combining Token-wise
Variational Bayesian Inference (T-VBI) for efficienty Bayesian adaptation and
Self-Optimizing Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (SO-KAN) for improving
interpretability. T-VBI innovatively reinterprets SAM's output tokens as
dynamic probabilistic weights and reparameterizes them as latent variables
without auxiliary training, enabling training-free VBI for uncertainty
estimation. SO-KAN improves token prediction with learnable spline activations
via self-supervised learning, providing insight to prune redundant tokens to
boost efficiency and accuracy. Experiments on five ultrasound datasets
demonstrated that E-BayesSAM achieves: (i) real-time inference (0.03s/image),
(ii) superior segmentation accuracy (average DSC: Pruned E-BayesSAM's 89.0\%
vs. E-BayesSAM's 88.0% vs. MedSAM's 88.3%), and (iii) identification of four
critical tokens governing SAM's decisions. By unifying efficiency, reliability,
and interpretability, E-BayesSAM bridges SAM's versatility with clinical needs,
advancing deployment in safety-critical medical applications. The source code

Abstract: We analyze data leakage in visual datasets. Data leakage refers to images in
evaluation benchmarks that have been seen during training, compromising fair
model evaluation. Given that large-scale datasets are often sourced from the

efforts are focused into identifying and studying this phenomenon. We
characterize visual leakage into different types according to its modality,

show that all the analyzed datasets present some form of leakage, and that all
types of leakage, from severe instances to more subtle cases, compromise the
reliability of model evaluation in downstream tasks.

Conclusion: CPE方法通过从语义角度构建全面的文本提示和紧凑的视觉提示，有效改喂了视觉-语言模型的零样性能

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) pre-trained on web-scale data exhibit promising
zero-shot generalization but often suffer from semantic misalignment due to
domain gaps between pre-training and downstream tasks. Existing approaches
primarily focus on text prompting with class-specific descriptions and
visual-text adaptation via aligning cropped image regions with textual
descriptions. However, they still face the issues of incomplete textual prompts
and noisy visual prompts. In this paper, we propose a novel constrained prompt
enhancement (CPE) method to improve visual-textual alignment by constructing
comprehensive textual prompts and compact visual prompts from the semantic
perspective. Specifically, our approach consists of two key components:
Topology-Guided Synonymous Semantic Generation (TGSSG) and Category-Agnostic
Discriminative Region Selection (CADRS). Textually, to address the issue of
incomplete semantic expression in textual prompts, our TGSSG first generates
synonymous semantic set for each category via large language models, and
constructs comprehensive textual prompts based on semantic ambiguity entropy
and persistent homology analysis. Visually, to mitigate the irrelevant visual
noise introduced by random cropping, our CADRS identifies discriminative
regions with activation maps outputted by a pre-trained vision model,
effectively filtering out noisy regions and generating compact visual prompts.
Given the comprehensive set of textual prompts and compact set of visual
prompts, we introduce two set-to-set matching strategies based on test-time
adaptation (TTA) and optimal transport (OT) to achieve effective visual-textual
alignment, and so improve zero-shot generalization of VLMs.

Conclusion: 该方法在保持多项式时间复杂度的同时，显著提高了点云配准的准确性和效率，特别是在高离群点比率情况下表现优异

Abstract: Point cloud registration based on correspondences computes the rigid
transformation that maximizes the number of inliers constrained within the
noise threshold. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods employing spatial
compatibility graphs or branch-and-bound (BnB) search mainly focus on
registration under high outlier ratios. However, graph-based methods require at
least quadratic space and time complexity for graph construction, while
multi-stage BnB search methods often suffer from inaccuracy due to local optima
between decomposed stages. This paper proposes a geometric maximum overlapping
registration framework via rotation-only BnB search. The rigid transformation
is decomposed using Chasles' theorem into a translation along rotation axis and
a 2D rigid transformation. The optimal rotation axis and angle are searched via
BnB, with residual parameters formulated as range maximum query (RMQ) problems.
Firstly, the top-k candidate rotation axes are searched within a hemisphere
parameterized by cube mapping, and the translation along each axis is estimated
through interval stabbing of the correspondences projected onto that axis.
Secondly, the 2D registration is relaxed to 1D rotation angle search with 2D
RMQ of geometric overlapping for axis-aligned rectangles, which is solved
deterministically in polynomial time using sweep line algorithm with segment
tree. Experimental results on 3DMatch, 3DLoMatch, and KITTI datasets
demonstrate superior accuracy and efficiency over SOTA methods, while the time
complexity is polynomial and the space complexity increases linearly with the
number of points, even in the worst case.

Method: 提出四个关键组件：1）KL散度正则化损失约束本地模型；2）KL散度剪枝加权聚合整合剪枝比例和分布相似性；3）稀疏激活跳过避免关键参数稀释；4）跨轮恢复动态控制剪枝机制。

Result: 在8个基准数据集上的实验表明，FedKLPR显著减少通信成本：ResNet-50减少33%-38%，ResNet-34减少20%-40%，同时模型精度下降控制在1%以内。

Conclusion: FedKLPR框架有效解决了联邦学习在行人重识别中的统计异构性和通信开销问题，实现了通信效率与模型精度的良好平衡。

Abstract: Person re-identification (Re-ID) is a fundamental task in intelligent
surveillance and public safety. Federated learning (FL) offers a
privacy-preserving solution by enabling collaborative model training without
centralized data collection. However, applying FL to real-world re-ID systems
faces two major challenges: statistical heterogeneity across clients due to
non-IID data distributions, and substantial communication overhead caused by
frequent transmission of large-scale models. To address these issues, we
propose FedKLPR, a lightweight and communication-efficient federated learning
framework for person re-identification. FedKLPR introduces four key components.
First, the KL-Divergence Regularization Loss (KLL) constrains local models by
minimizing the divergence from the global feature distribution, effectively
mitigating the effects of statistical heterogeneity and improving convergence
stability under non-IID conditions. Secondly, KL-Divergence-Prune Weighted
Aggregation (KLPWA) integrates pruning ratio and distributional similarity into
the aggregation process, thereby improving the robustness of the global model
while significantly reducing communication overhead. Furthermore, sparse
Activation Skipping (SAS) mitigates the dilution of critical parameters during
the aggregation of pruned client models by excluding zero-valued weights from
the update process. Finally, Cross-Round Recovery (CRR) introduces a dynamic
pruning control mechanism that halts pruning when necessary, enabling deeper
compression while maintaining model accuracy. Experimental results on eight
benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedKLPR achieves significant communication
reduction. Compared with the state-of-the-art, FedKLPR reduces 33\%-38\%
communication cost on ResNet-50 and 20\%-40\% communication cost on ResNet-34,
while maintaining model accuracy within 1\% degradation.

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) focuses on recovering
high-quality images from low-resolution inputs that suffer from complex
degradations like noise, blur, and compression. Recently, diffusion models
(DMs) have shown great potential in this area by leveraging strong generative
priors to restore fine details. However, their iterative denoising process
incurs high computational overhead, posing challenges for real-time
applications. Although one-step distillation methods, such as OSEDiff and
TSD-SR, offer faster inference, they remain fundamentally constrained by their
large, over-parameterized model architectures. In this work, we present TinySR,
a compact yet effective diffusion model specifically designed for Real-ISR that
achieves real-time performance while maintaining perceptual quality. We
introduce a Dynamic Inter-block Activation and an Expansion-Corrosion Strategy
to facilitate more effective decision-making in depth pruning. We achieve VAE
compression through channel pruning, attention removal and lightweight SepConv.
We eliminate time- and prompt-related modules and perform pre-caching
techniques to further speed up the model. TinySR significantly reduces
computational cost and model size, achieving up to 5.68x speedup and 83%
parameter reduction compared to its teacher TSD-SR, while still providing high

Abstract: Despite the remarkable capabilities of text-to-image (T2I) generation models,
real-world applications often demand fine-grained, iterative image editing that
existing methods struggle to provide. Key challenges include granular
instruction understanding, robust context preservation during modifications,
and the lack of intelligent feedback mechanisms for iterative refinement. This
paper introduces RefineEdit-Agent, a novel, training-free intelligent agent
framework designed to address these limitations by enabling complex, iterative,
and context-aware image editing. RefineEdit-Agent leverages the powerful
planning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the advanced visual
understanding and evaluation prowess of Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs)
within a closed-loop system. Our framework comprises an LVLM-driven instruction
parser and scene understanding module, a multi-level LLM-driven editing planner
for goal decomposition, tool selection, and sequence generation, an iterative
image editing module, and a crucial LVLM-driven feedback and evaluation loop.
To rigorously evaluate RefineEdit-Agent, we propose LongBench-T2I-Edit, a new
benchmark featuring 500 initial images with complex, multi-turn editing
instructions across nine visual dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that RefineEdit-Agent significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines,
achieving an average score of 3.67 on LongBench-T2I-Edit, compared to 2.29 for
Direct Re-Prompting, 2.91 for InstructPix2Pix, 3.16 for GLIGEN-based Edit, and
3.39 for ControlNet-XL. Ablation studies, human evaluations, and analyses of
iterative refinement, backbone choices, tool usage, and robustness to
instruction complexity further validate the efficacy of our agentic design in
delivering superior edit fidelity and context preservation.

Abstract: This paper addresses the limitations of neural rendering-based multi-view
surface reconstruction methods, which require an additional mesh extraction
step that is inconvenient and would produce poor-quality surfaces with mesh
aliasing, restricting downstream applications. Building on the explicit mesh
representation and differentiable rasterization framework, this work proposes
an efficient solution that preserves the high efficiency of this framework
while significantly improving reconstruction quality and versatility.
Specifically, we introduce a disentangled geometry and appearance model that
does not rely on deep networks, enhancing learning and broadening
applicability. A neural deformation field is constructed to incorporate global
geometric context, enhancing geometry learning, while a novel regularization
constrains geometric features passed to a neural shader to ensure its accuracy
and boost shading. For appearance, a view-invariant diffuse term is separated
and baked into mesh vertices, further improving rendering efficiency.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art training (4.84 minutes) and rendering (0.023 seconds) speeds,
with reconstruction quality that is competitive with top-performing methods.
Moreover, the method enables practical applications such as mesh and texture
editing, showcasing its versatility and application potential. This combination
of efficiency, competitive quality, and broad applicability makes our approach
a valuable contribution to multi-view surface reconstruction and rendering.

Abstract: Inferring the physical properties of 3D scenes from visual information is a
critical yet challenging task for creating interactive and realistic virtual
worlds. While humans intuitively grasp material characteristics such as
elasticity or stiffness, existing methods often rely on slow, per-scene
optimization, limiting their generalizability and application. To address this
problem, we introduce PIXIE, a novel method that trains a generalizable neural
network to predict physical properties across multiple scenes from 3D visual
features purely using supervised losses. Once trained, our feed-forward network
can perform fast inference of plausible material fields, which coupled with a
learned static scene representation like Gaussian Splatting enables realistic
physics simulation under external forces. To facilitate this research, we also
collected PIXIEVERSE, one of the largest known datasets of paired 3D assets and
physic material annotations. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that PIXIE is
about 1.46-4.39x better and orders of magnitude faster than test-time
optimization methods. By leveraging pretrained visual features like CLIP, our
method can also zero-shot generalize to real-world scenes despite only ever
been trained on synthetic data. https://pixie-3d.github.io/

TL;DR: 本文提出了室内3D物体检测的跨数据集适应基准，分析了不同域差距对检测器性能的影响，并提供了改进适应性能的基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D物体检测研究主要在分布相同的训练测试集上进行，缺乏对跨数据集适应能力的评估。不同室内点云数据集在采集方式、点云质量、边界框布局和实例特征等方面存在差异，导致检测器容易过拟合到特定数据集的特征。

Method: 构建了包含ScanNet、SUN RGB-D、3D Front以及新提出的ProcTHOR-OD和ProcFront模拟数据集的综合基准。设计了合成到真实、点云质量、布局和实例特征四种适应场景的实验，并提出了几种改进适应性能的方法。

Result: 通过跨数据集实验系统分析了不同域差距对3D物体检测器的影响，验证了所提方法在域适应性能上的改进效果。

Conclusion: 该研究为域自适应室内3D物体检测提供了基准和方法，希望未来能开发出具有更强跨域泛化能力的检测器。

Abstract: As a fundamental task for indoor scene understanding, 3D object detection has
been extensively studied, and the accuracy on indoor point cloud data has been
substantially improved. However, existing researches have been conducted on
limited datasets, where the training and testing sets share the same
distribution. In this paper, we consider the task of adapting indoor 3D object
detectors from one dataset to another, presenting a comprehensive benchmark
with ScanNet, SUN RGB-D and 3D Front datasets, as well as our newly proposed
large-scale datasets ProcTHOR-OD and ProcFront generated by a 3D simulator.
Since indoor point cloud datasets are collected and constructed in different
ways, the object detectors are likely to overfit to specific factors within
each dataset, such as point cloud quality, bounding box layout and instance
features. We conduct experiments across datasets on different adaptation
scenarios including synthetic-to-real adaptation, point cloud quality
adaptation, layout adaptation and instance feature adaptation, analyzing the
impact of different domain gaps on 3D object detectors. We also introduce
several approaches to improve adaptation performances, providing baselines for
domain adaptive indoor 3D object detection, hoping that future works may
propose detectors with stronger generalization ability across domains. Our

### [107] [Multi-Level LVLM Guidance for Untrimmed Video Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17442)
*Liyang Peng,Sihan Zhu,Yunjie Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ECVT是一种新颖的视频动作识别架构，利用大型视觉语言模型生成多粒度语义描述，通过双分支设计和跨模态融合机制显著提升视频时序结构和事件逻辑理解能力，在多个基准数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在复杂未修剪视频中难以捕捉细粒度动作、长期时序依赖和从低级视觉特征提取高级语义信息的问题。

Method: 采用双分支设计：视频编码分支用于时空特征提取，跨模态引导分支利用LVLM生成全局事件提示和时序子事件提示等多粒度语义描述，通过自适应门控、跨模态注意力和事件图模块进行融合。

Result: 在ActivityNet v1.3上平均mAP达到40.5%，在THUMOS14上mAP@0.5达到67.1%，显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: ECVT通过有效整合视觉语言模型的语义理解能力，成功提升了视频动作识别和定位的性能，证明了跨模态语义引导在视频理解中的重要性。

Abstract: Action recognition and localization in complex, untrimmed videos remain a
formidable challenge in computer vision, largely due to the limitations of
existing methods in capturing fine-grained actions, long-term temporal
dependencies, and high-level semantic information from low-level visual
features. This paper introduces the Event-Contextualized Video Transformer
(ECVT), a novel architecture that leverages the advanced semantic understanding
capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to bridge this gap. ECVT
employs a dual-branch design, comprising a Video Encoding Branch for
spatio-temporal feature extraction and a Cross-Modal Guidance Branch. The
latter utilizes an LVLM to generate multi-granularity semantic descriptions,
including Global Event Prompting for macro-level narrative and Temporal
Sub-event Prompting for fine-grained action details. These multi-level textual
cues are integrated into the video encoder's learning process through
sophisticated mechanisms such as adaptive gating for high-level semantic
fusion, cross-modal attention for fine-grained feature refinement, and an event
graph module for temporal context calibration. Trained end-to-end with a
comprehensive loss function incorporating semantic consistency and temporal
calibration terms, ECVT significantly enhances the model's ability to
understand video temporal structures and event logic. Extensive experiments on
ActivityNet v1.3 and THUMOS14 datasets demonstrate that ECVT achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with an average mAP of 40.5% on ActivityNet v1.3
and mAP@0.5 of 67.1% on THUMOS14, outperforming leading baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业环境中收集真实数据存在实践和经济障碍，特别是在海上石油平台等危险环境中，这严重限制了自主检查系统的发展。

Method: 提出混合数据合成管道：使用BlenderProc进行照相写实图像生成和领域随机化，集成NVIDIA Cosmos-Predict2世界基础模型来生成物理可行的视频序列，捐捕稀有视角和恶劣条件。

Abstract: This work addresses the challenges of data scarcity and high acquisition
costs for training robust object detection models in complex industrial
environments, such as offshore oil platforms. The practical and economic
barriers to collecting real-world data in these hazardous settings often hamper
the development of autonomous inspection systems. To overcome this, in this
work we propose and validate a hybrid data synthesis pipeline that combines
procedural rendering with AI-driven video generation. Our methodology leverages
BlenderProc to create photorealistic images with precise annotations and
controlled domain randomization, and integrates NVIDIA's Cosmos-Predict2
world-foundation model to synthesize physically plausible video sequences with
temporal diversity, capturing rare viewpoints and adverse conditions. We
demonstrate that a YOLO-based detection network trained on a composite dataset,
blending real images with our synthetic data, achieves superior performance
compared to models trained exclusively on real-world data. Notably, a 1:1
mixture of real and synthetic data yielded the highest accuracy, surpassing the
real-only baseline. These findings highlight the viability of a synthetic-first
approach as an efficient, cost-effective, and safe alternative for developing
reliable perception systems in safety-critical and resource-constrained
industrial applications.

Conclusion: GraphMMP在多模态医学预后任务中表现出有效性，为解决多模态医学数据分析中的复杂交互建模问题提供了有效方案

Abstract: In the field of multimodal medical data analysis, leveraging diverse types of
data and understanding their hidden relationships continues to be a research
focus. The main challenges lie in effectively modeling the complex interactions
between heterogeneous data modalities with distinct characteristics while
capturing both local and global dependencies across modalities. To address
these challenges, this paper presents a two-stage multimodal prognosis model,
GraphMMP, which is based on graph neural networks. The proposed model
constructs feature graphs using mutual information and features a global fusion
module built on Mamba, which significantly boosts prognosis performance.
Empirical results show that GraphMMP surpasses existing methods on datasets
related to liver prognosis and the METABRIC study, demonstrating its
effectiveness in multimodal medical prognosis tasks.

Motivation: 现有微调范式在过度自由和过度限制之间摇摆，导致多模态跟踪器在适应预训练RGB模型时出现次优的可塑性-稳定性权衡

Method: 首先分析预训练权重的切空间来测量和定向先验敏感度以保持泛化性，然后在调优阶段探索迁移敏感度以强调适应性和稳定性，将这些敏感度作为正则化项融入学习过程

Result: 在多种多模态跟踪任务上超越了当前最先进技术，显著提升了跨模态迁移能力

Conclusion: 提出的敏感度感知正则化调优框架有效解决了多模态跟踪器优化中的关键挑战，实现了更好的性能表现

Abstract: This paper tackles the critical challenge of optimizing multi-modal trackers
by effectively adapting the pre-trained models for RGB data. Existing
fine-tuning paradigms oscillate between excessive freedom and over-restriction,
both leading to a suboptimal plasticity-stability trade-off. To mitigate this
dilemma, we propose a novel sensitivity-aware regularized tuning framework,
which delicately refines the learning process by incorporating intrinsic
parameter sensitivities. Through a comprehensive investigation from pre-trained
to multi-modal contexts, we identify that parameters sensitive to pivotal
foundational patterns and cross-domain shifts are primary drivers of this
issue. Specifically, we first analyze the tangent space of pre-trained weights
to measure and orient prior sensitivities, dedicated to preserving
generalization. Then, we further explore transfer sensitivities during the
tuning phase, emphasizing adaptability and stability. By incorporating these
sensitivities as regularization terms, our method significantly enhances the
transferability across modalities. Extensive experiments showcase the superior
performance of the proposed method, surpassing current state-of-the-art
techniques across various multi-modal tracking. The source code and models will
be publicly available at https://github.com/zhiwen-xdu/SRTrack.

Motivation: 人类社交行为本质上是多模态的，需要强大的视听模型来进行感知。现有的多模态模型在社交场景中的表现仍有提升空间。

Method: 扩展CAV-MAE模型以接收更多帧输入，在VoxCeleb2大型人类社交互动数据集上进行自监督预训练，然后在多个社交情感下游任务上进行微调。

Result: 在多模态情感识别和笑声识别任务上达到最先进水平，在外显人格估计任务上获得有竞争力的结果。

Conclusion: 领域内自监督预训练对社交行为感知任务非常有效，Social-MAE展示了在多模态社交分析中的强大能力。

Abstract: Human social behaviors are inherently multimodal necessitating the
development of powerful audiovisual models for their perception. In this paper,
we present Social-MAE, our pre-trained audiovisual Masked Autoencoder based on
an extended version of Contrastive Audio-Visual Masked Auto-Encoder (CAV-MAE),
which is pre-trained on audiovisual social data. Specifically, we modify
CAV-MAE to receive a larger number of frames as input and pre-train it on a
large dataset of human social interaction (VoxCeleb2) in a self-supervised
manner. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this model by finetuning and
evaluating the model on different social and affective downstream tasks,
namely, emotion recognition, laughter detection and apparent personality
estimation. The model achieves state-of-the-art results on multimodal emotion
recognition and laughter recognition and competitive results for apparent

TL;DR: 结合DINO和Barlow Twins两种自监督学习方法的混合模型，在仅使用10%标注数据的情况下，在MS COCO数据集上实现了与DINO相当的性能，同时降低了计算资源需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无标签图像理解的成本问题，结合两种方法的互补优势：DINO的师生学习策略和Barlow Twins的冗余减少目标，以在资源受限环境下实现更好的学习效果。

Method: 将Barlow Twins的冗余减少目标与DINO的自蒸馏策略相结合，在MS COCO数据集上使用仅10%的标注数据进行线性探测训练，并与单独的DINO和Barlow Twins实现进行对比评估。

Result: 混合方法实现了与DINO相当的损失和分类准确率，同时保持了强大的特征表示能力。注意力可视化显示混合模型具有改进的语义分割能力。

Conclusion: 这种组合方法为在资源受限环境中训练ViT提供了一种可扩展、标签高效的替代方案。

Abstract: Training AI models to understand images without costly labeled data remains a
challenge. We combine two techniques--DINO (teacher-student learning) and
Barlow Twins (redundancy reduction)--to create a model that learns better with
fewer labels and less compute. While both DINO and Barlow Twins have
independently demonstrated strong performance in self-supervised learning, each
comes with limitations--DINO may be sensitive to certain augmentations, and
Barlow Twins often requires batch sizes too large to fit on consumer hardware.
By combining the redundancy-reduction objective of Barlow Twins with the
self-distillation strategy of DINO, we aim to leverage their complementary
strengths. We train a hybrid model on the MS COCO dataset using only 10\% of
labeled data for linear probing, and evaluate its performance against
standalone DINO and Barlow Twins implementations. Preliminary results show that
the combined approach achieves comparable loss and classification accuracy to
DINO while maintaining strong feature representations. Attention visualizations
further suggest improved semantic segmentation capability in the hybrid model.
This combined method offers a scalable, label-efficient alternative for
training ViTs in resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: OmniMRI是一个统一的视觉-语言基础模型，旨在整合MRI工作流程中的多个任务，包括重建、分割、检测、诊断和报告生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MRI工作流程分散且缺乏通用性，现有方法通常是针对特定解剖结构或应用的，且很少整合影像数据和临床语言信息。

Method: 采用多阶段训练范式：自监督视觉预训练、视觉-语言对齐、多模态预训练和多任务指令调优，使用来自60个公共数据集的22万MRI体积和1900万MRI切片的大规模异构语料库。

Result: 定性结果表明OmniMRI能够在单一架构中执行多样化任务，包括MRI重建、解剖和病理分割、异常检测、诊断建议和放射学报告生成。

Conclusion: OmniMRI有潜力将分散的流程整合为可扩展的通用框架，为统一成像和临床语言的端到端MRI解释基础模型铺平道路。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is indispensable in clinical practice but
remains constrained by fragmented, multi-stage workflows encompassing
acquisition, reconstruction, segmentation, detection, diagnosis, and reporting.
While deep learning has achieved progress in individual tasks, existing
approaches are often anatomy- or application-specific and lack generalizability
across diverse clinical settings. Moreover, current pipelines rarely integrate
imaging data with complementary language information that radiologists rely on
in routine practice. Here, we introduce OmniMRI, a unified vision-language
foundation model designed to generalize across the entire MRI workflow. OmniMRI
is trained on a large-scale, heterogeneous corpus curated from 60 public
datasets, over 220,000 MRI volumes and 19 million MRI slices, incorporating
image-only data, paired vision-text data, and instruction-response data. Its
multi-stage training paradigm, comprising self-supervised vision pretraining,
vision-language alignment, multimodal pretraining, and multi-task instruction
tuning, progressively equips the model with transferable visual
representations, cross-modal reasoning, and robust instruction-following
capabilities. Qualitative results demonstrate OmniMRI's ability to perform
diverse tasks within a single architecture, including MRI reconstruction,
anatomical and pathological segmentation, abnormality detection, diagnostic
suggestion, and radiology report generation. These findings highlight OmniMRI's
potential to consolidate fragmented pipelines into a scalable, generalist
framework, paving the way toward foundation models that unify imaging and
clinical language for comprehensive, end-to-end MRI interpretation.

Motivation: 医学影像数据稀缺限制了从头训练模型的效能，迁移学习成为关键解决方案。研究旨在确定最优CNN架构并比较不同预训练策略在医学影像分类任务中的效果。

Method: 使用1维卷积分类器、带跳跃连接的ResNet50预训练骨干网络，以及部分骨干网络解冻策略。在乳腺病变恶性检测和ACL撕裂检测任务上进行实验。

Result: 最佳模型在ACL撕裂检测上达到0.9969 AUC，在乳腺结节恶性检测上达到0.9641 AUC，与Mei等人的结果相当并超越其他先前工作。未发现RadImageNet预训练在这两个任务上比ImageNet预训练表现更优的证据。

Conclusion: ResNet50预训练骨干网络配合部分解冻策略在医学影像分类任务中表现最佳，但RadImageNet预训练并未显示出相对于ImageNet预训练的明显优势。

Abstract: Modern computer vision models have proven to be highly useful for medical
imaging classification and segmentation tasks, but the scarcity of medical
imaging data often limits the efficacy of models trained from scratch. Transfer
learning has emerged as a pivotal solution to this, enabling the fine-tuning of
high-performance models on small data. Mei et al. (2022) found that
pre-training CNNs on a large dataset of radiologist-labeled images
(RadImageNet) enhanced model performance on downstream tasks compared to
ImageNet pretraining. The present work extends Mei et al. (2022) by conducting
a comprehensive investigation to determine optimal CNN architectures for breast
lesion malignancy detection and ACL tear detection, as well as performing
statistical analysis to compare the effect of RadImageNet and ImageNet
pre-training on downstream model performance. Our findings suggest that
1-dimensional convolutional classifiers with skip connections, ResNet50
pre-trained backbones, and partial backbone unfreezing yields optimal
downstream medical classification performance. Our best models achieve AUCs of
0.9969 for ACL tear detection and 0.9641 for breast nodule malignancy
detection, competitive with the results reported by Mei et al. (2022) and
surpassing other previous works. We do not find evidence confirming RadImageNet
pre-training to provide superior downstream performance for ACL tear and breast
lesion classification tasks.

Abstract: Metamaterials are micro-architected structures whose geometry imparts highly
tunable-often counter-intuitive-bulk properties. Yet their design is difficult
because of geometric complexity and a non-trivial mapping from architecture to
behaviour. We address these challenges with three complementary contributions.
(i) MetaDSL: a compact, semantically rich domain-specific language that
captures diverse metamaterial designs in a form that is both human-readable and
machine-parsable. (ii) MetaDB: a curated repository of more than 150,000
parameterized MetaDSL programs together with their
derivatives-three-dimensional geometry, multi-view renderings, and simulated
elastic properties. (iii) MetaBench: benchmark suites that test three core
capabilities of vision-language metamaterial assistants-structure
reconstruction, property-driven inverse design, and performance prediction. We
establish baselines by fine-tuning state-of-the-art vision-language models and
deploy an omni-model within an interactive, CAD-like interface. Case studies
show that our framework provides a strong first step toward integrated design
and understanding of structure-representation-property relationships.

<details>

Motivation: 军事组织开发高分辨率3D虚拟环境成本高昂，战场动态变化需要频繁更新，传统全规模更新方式耗时耗力

Result: IDU管道显著减少更新时间和人力，为快速演变的军事场景提供经济高效的目标更新解决方案

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了动态战场环境下3D模型维护的挑战，提供了实用且成本效益高的增量更新方案

Abstract: For simulation and training purposes, military organizations have made
substantial investments in developing high-resolution 3D virtual environments
through extensive imaging and 3D scanning. However, the dynamic nature of
battlefield conditions-where objects may appear or vanish over time-makes
frequent full-scale updates both time-consuming and costly. In response, we
introduce the Incremental Dynamic Update (IDU) pipeline, which efficiently
updates existing 3D reconstructions, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), with
only a small set of newly acquired images. Our approach starts with camera pose
estimation to align new images with the existing 3D model, followed by change
detection to pinpoint modifications in the scene. A 3D generative AI model is
then used to create high-quality 3D assets of the new elements, which are
seamlessly integrated into the existing 3D model. The IDU pipeline incorporates
human guidance to ensure high accuracy in object identification and placement,
with each update focusing on a single new object at a time. Experimental
results confirm that our proposed IDU pipeline significantly reduces update
time and labor, offering a cost-effective and targeted solution for maintaining
up-to-date 3D models in rapidly evolving military scenarios.

TL;DR: HERO是一个无需训练的分层加速框架，通过浅层补丁刷新机制和深层线性外推方案，显著提升生成式世界模型的推理速度1.73倍，同时保持质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式世界模型由于扩散模型的迭代特性导致推理速度缓慢，现有加速技术直接应用于世界模型会导致质量下降。研究发现世界模型存在特征耦合现象：浅层特征时间变化大，深层特征更稳定。

Method: 分层加速策略：浅层使用补丁刷新机制选择需要重新计算的token，避免额外度量计算；深层使用线性外推方案直接估计中间特征，完全绕过注意力模块和前馈网络的计算。

Result: HERO实现了1.73倍的加速效果，质量下降最小，显著优于现有的扩散加速方法。

Conclusion: HERO框架有效解决了世界模型推理效率问题，通过层次化策略充分利用了多模态特征的时间特性，在保持生成质量的同时大幅提升推理速度。

Abstract: Generation-driven world models create immersive virtual environments but
suffer slow inference due to the iterative nature of diffusion models. While
recent advances have improved diffusion model efficiency, directly applying
these techniques to world models introduces limitations such as quality
degradation. In this paper, we present HERO, a training-free hierarchical
acceleration framework tailored for efficient world models. Owing to the
multi-modal nature of world models, we identify a feature coupling phenomenon,
wherein shallow layers exhibit high temporal variability, while deeper layers
yield more stable feature representations. Motivated by this, HERO adopts
hierarchical strategies to accelerate inference: (i) In shallow layers, a
patch-wise refresh mechanism efficiently selects tokens for recomputation. With
patch-wise sampling and frequency-aware tracking, it avoids extra metric
computation and remain compatible with FlashAttention. (ii) In deeper layers, a
linear extrapolation scheme directly estimates intermediate features. This
completely bypasses the computations in attention modules and feed-forward
networks. Our experiments show that HERO achieves a 1.73$\times$ speedup with
minimal quality degradation, significantly outperforming existing diffusion
acceleration methods.

Abstract: Reasoning about fine-grained spatial relationships in warehouse-scale
environments poses a significant challenge for existing vision-language models
(VLMs), which often struggle to comprehend 3D layouts, object arrangements, and
multimodal cues in real-world industrial settings. In this paper, we present
TinyGiantVLM, a lightweight and modular two-stage framework designed for
physical spatial reasoning, distinguishing itself from traditional geographic
reasoning in complex logistics scenes. Our approach encodes both global and
region-level features from RGB and depth modalities using pretrained visual
backbones. To effectively handle the complexity of high-modality inputs and
diverse question types, we incorporate a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) fusion
module, which dynamically combines spatial representations to support
downstream reasoning tasks and improve convergence. Training is conducted in a
two-phase strategy: the first phase focuses on generating free-form answers to
enhance spatial reasoning ability, while the second phase uses normalized
answers for evaluation. Evaluated on Track 3 of the AI City Challenge 2025, our
64M-parameter base model achieved 5th place on the leaderboard with a score of
66.8861, demonstrating strong performance in bridging visual perception and
spatial understanding in industrial environments. We further present an
80M-parameter variant with expanded MoE capacity, which demonstrates improved
performance on spatial reasoning tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HotSpotter是一个快速准确的动物个体识别算法，通过提取和匹配关键点（热点）来识别特定个体，适用于多种物种，在1000+图像数据库上实现秒级匹配且准确率优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个非物种特异性、快速准确的动物个体识别系统，以解决野生动物保护和研究中对个体动物进行有效识别和追踪的需求。

Method: 提出两种基于关键点提取和匹配的方法：1）顺序匹配方法，逐个查询数据库图像并生成分数；2）基于快速最近邻搜索的匹配方法，采用竞争性评分机制（源自Local Naive Bayes Nearest Neighbor算法）。

Result: 在包含1000多张图像的数据库上测试，相比已发表的方法获得了更准确的匹配结果，每个查询图像的匹配时间仅需几秒钟。

Conclusion: HotSpotter算法在动物个体识别任务中表现出色，具有快速、准确和非物种特异性的优势，为野生动物监测和保护提供了有效的技术解决方案。

Abstract: We present HotSpotter, a fast, accurate algorithm for identifying individual
animals against a labeled database. It is not species specific and has been
applied to Grevy's and plains zebras, giraffes, leopards, and lionfish. We
describe two approaches, both based on extracting and matching keypoints or
"hotspots". The first tests each new query image sequentially against each
database image, generating a score for each database image in isolation, and
ranking the results. The second, building on recent techniques for instance
recognition, matches the query image against the database using a fast nearest
neighbor search. It uses a competitive scoring mechanism derived from the Local
Naive Bayes Nearest Neighbor algorithm recently proposed for category
recognition. We demonstrate results on databases of more than 1000 images,
producing more accurate matches than published methods and matching each query
image in just a few seconds.

*Nur Amirah Abd Hamid,Mohd Ibrahim Shapiai,Daphne Teck Ching Lai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于加权Vision Transformer的多任务学习框架，联合预测ADAS-Cog总分及其13个子分数，通过子分数特异性损失权重提升预测准确性和可解释性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注预测ADAS-Cog总分，但忽略了13个子分数的预测价值，这些子分数反映不同的认知领域，某些子分数对总分的确定具有更大影响

Method: 使用Vision Transformer作为特征提取器，构建多任务学习框架，系统研究子分数特异性损失加权对模型性能的影响

Result: 提出的加权策略具有群体依赖性：强加权改善MRI模式更异质的MCI受试者性能，中等加权对变异度较低的CN受试者更有效

Conclusion: 统一加权未充分利用关键子分数并限制泛化能力，提出的框架为基于MRI的AD预后提供了灵活可解释的端到端学习方法

Abstract: Prognostic modeling is essential for forecasting future clinical scores and
enabling early detection of Alzheimers disease (AD). While most existing
methods focus on predicting the ADAS-Cog global score, they often overlook the
predictive value of its 13 sub-scores, which reflect distinct cognitive
domains. Some sub-scores may exert greater influence on determining global
scores. Assigning higher loss weights to these clinically meaningful sub-scores
can guide the model to focus on more relevant cognitive domains, enhancing both
predictive accuracy and interpretability. In this study, we propose a weighted
Vision Transformer (ViT)-based multi-task learning (MTL) framework to jointly
predict the ADAS-Cog global score using baseline MRI scans and its 13
sub-scores at Month 24. Our framework integrates ViT as a feature extractor and
systematically investigates the impact of sub-score-specific loss weighting on
model performance. Results show that our proposed weighting strategies are
group-dependent: strong weighting improves performance for MCI subjects with
more heterogeneous MRI patterns, while moderate weighting is more effective for
CN subjects with lower variability. Our findings suggest that uniform weighting
underutilizes key sub-scores and limits generalization. The proposed framework
offers a flexible, interpretable approach to AD prognosis using end-to-end
MRI-based learning. (Github repo link will be provided after review)

TL;DR: JCo-MVTON是一个无需人体掩码的虚拟试穿框架，通过多模态扩散变换器整合参考人物图像和目标服装图像，在去噪过程中实现精确的空间对齐和服装-人物融合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统虚拟试穿系统严重依赖人体掩码，对服装属性的细粒度控制有限，且在真实场景中泛化能力差。

Method: 基于多模态扩散变换器(MM-DiT)架构，通过专用条件路径在自注意力层融合特征，采用双向生成策略构建数据集，包括掩码模型生成参考图像和自监督训练的"Try-Off"模型恢复服装图像。

Result: 在DressCode等公开基准测试中达到最先进性能，定量指标和人工评估均显著优于现有方法，在真实应用中表现出强大的泛化能力，超越商业系统。

Conclusion: JCo-MVTON通过创新的多模态融合和数据集构建方法，成功解决了虚拟试穿系统的关键限制，实现了无需掩码的高质量虚拟试穿效果。

Abstract: Virtual try-on systems have long been hindered by heavy reliance on human
body masks, limited fine-grained control over garment attributes, and poor
generalization to real-world, in-the-wild scenarios. In this paper, we propose
JCo-MVTON (Jointly Controllable Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer for Mask-Free
Virtual Try-On), a novel framework that overcomes these limitations by
integrating diffusion-based image generation with multi-modal conditional
fusion. Built upon a Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) backbone, our
approach directly incorporates diverse control signals -- such as the reference
person image and the target garment image -- into the denoising process through
dedicated conditional pathways that fuse features within the self-attention
layers. This fusion is further enhanced with refined positional encodings and
attention masks, enabling precise spatial alignment and improved garment-person
integration. To address data scarcity and quality, we introduce a bidirectional
generation strategy for dataset construction: one pipeline uses a mask-based
model to generate realistic reference images, while a symmetric ``Try-Off''
model, trained in a self-supervised manner, recovers the corresponding garment
images. The synthesized dataset undergoes rigorous manual curation, allowing
iterative improvement in visual fidelity and diversity. Experiments demonstrate
that JCo-MVTON achieves state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks
including DressCode, significantly outperforming existing methods in both
quantitative metrics and human evaluations. Moreover, it shows strong
generalization in real-world applications, surpassing commercial systems.

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注ADAS-Cog总分预测，忽略了子项评分在领域特异性认知衰退中的预测价值，且先前多任务学习研究未充分探究子项对总分的贡献。

Method: 采用多任务学习框架，使用Vision Transformer和Swin Transformer提取MRI影像特征，与纵向临床评分融合，联合预测24个月时的ADAS-Cog总分和13个子项评分。

Result: 子项学习提高了总分预测精度，Q1、Q4、Q8等少数子项主导总分预测，但部分重要子项预测误差较大，存在模型不稳定问题，主要由临床特征主导导致。

Conclusion: 研究证明了子项信息建模的价值，揭示了需要改进多模态融合和自适应损失加权以实现更平衡学习，为构建更可解释和临床稳健的AD预测框架提供见解。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of clinical scores is critical for early detection and
prognosis of Alzheimers disease (AD). While existing approaches primarily focus
on forecasting the ADAS-Cog global score, they often overlook the predictive
value of its sub-scores (13 items), which capture domain-specific cognitive
decline. In this study, we propose a multi task learning (MTL) framework that
jointly predicts the global ADAS-Cog score and its sub-scores (13 items) at
Month 24 using baseline MRI and longitudinal clinical scores from baseline and
Month 6. The main goal is to examine how each sub scores particularly those
associated with MRI features contribute to the prediction of the global score,
an aspect largely neglected in prior MTL studies. We employ Vision Transformer
(ViT) and Swin Transformer architectures to extract imaging features, which are
fused with longitudinal clinical inputs to model cognitive progression. Our
results show that incorporating sub-score learning improves global score
prediction. Subscore level analysis reveals that a small subset especially Q1
(Word Recall), Q4 (Delayed Recall), and Q8 (Word Recognition) consistently
dominates the predicted global score. However, some of these influential
sub-scores exhibit high prediction errors, pointing to model instability.
Further analysis suggests that this is caused by clinical feature dominance,
where the model prioritizes easily predictable clinical scores over more
complex MRI derived features. These findings emphasize the need for improved
multimodal fusion and adaptive loss weighting to achieve more balanced
learning. Our study demonstrates the value of sub score informed modeling and
provides insights into building more interpretable and clinically robust AD
prediction frameworks. (Github repo provided)

Conclusion: 该研究成功将Mamba架构与重建方法结合，为室外场景开放集分割提供了有效解决方案，在性能和可扩展性方面都取得了显著进步

Abstract: LiDAR scanning in outdoor scenes acquires accurate distance measurements over
wide areas, producing large-scale point clouds. Application examples for this
data include robotics, automotive vehicles, and land surveillance. During such
applications, outlier objects from outside the training data will inevitably
appear. Our research contributes a novel approach to open-set segmentation,
leveraging the learnings of object defect-detection research. We also draw on
the Mamba architecture's strong performance in utilising long-range
dependencies and scalability to large data. Combining both, we create a
reconstruction based approach for the task of outdoor scene open-set
segmentation. We show that our approach improves performance not only when
applied to our our own open-set segmentation method, but also when applied to
existing methods. Furthermore we contribute a Mamba based architecture which is
competitive with existing voxel-convolution based methods on challenging,
large-scale pointclouds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 慢性伤口管理是主要医疗挑战，临床评估依赖主观耗时的手动记录方法。现有2D数字视频测量框架存在视角失真、视野有限和无法捕捉伤口深度等问题，特别是在解剖复杂或弯曲区域。

Method: 开发Wound3DAssist框架，从手持智能手机短视频生成准确3D模型，集成3D重建、伤口分割、组织分类和伤口周围分析到模块化工作流程中，实现非接触式自动测量。

Conclusion: Wound3DAssist框架展示了在真实临床环境中使用的可行性，为慢性伤口管理提供了更准确、高效的3D评估解决方案。

Abstract: Managing chronic wounds remains a major healthcare challenge, with clinical
assessment often relying on subjective and time-consuming manual documentation
methods. Although 2D digital videometry frameworks aided the measurement
process, these approaches struggle with perspective distortion, a limited field
of view, and an inability to capture wound depth, especially in anatomically
complex or curved regions. To overcome these limitations, we present
Wound3DAssist, a practical framework for 3D wound assessment using monocular
consumer-grade videos. Our framework generates accurate 3D models from short
handheld smartphone video recordings, enabling non-contact, automatic
measurements that are view-independent and robust to camera motion. We
integrate 3D reconstruction, wound segmentation, tissue classification, and
periwound analysis into a modular workflow. We evaluate Wound3DAssist across
digital models with known geometry, silicone phantoms, and real patients.
Results show that the framework supports high-quality wound bed visualization,
millimeter-level accuracy, and reliable tissue composition analysis. Full
assessments are completed in under 20 minutes, demonstrating feasibility for
real-world clinical use.

Method: 基于模板匹配和回归的检测器，在冻结骨干网络顶部使用少量可学习的卷积或投影层来保留和利用样本的空间布局信息

Result: 在RPINE、FSCD-147和FSCD-LVIS三个基准测试中均优于最先进方法，并在跨数据集评估中表现出强泛化能力

Conclusion: 经典的模板匹配和回归方法在少样本模式检测中仍然有效，能够更好地处理各种类型的模式检测任务

Abstract: We address the problem of few-shot pattern detection, which aims to detect
all instances of a given pattern, typically represented by a few exemplars,
from an input image. Although similar problems have been studied in few-shot
object counting and detection (FSCD), previous methods and their benchmarks
have narrowed patterns of interest to object categories and often fail to
localize non-object patterns. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective
detector based on template matching and regression, dubbed TMR. While previous
FSCD methods typically represent target exemplars as spatially collapsed
prototypes and lose structural information, we revisit classic template
matching and regression. It effectively preserves and leverages the spatial
layout of exemplars through a minimalistic structure with a small number of
learnable convolutional or projection layers on top of a frozen backbone We
also introduce a new dataset, dubbed RPINE, which covers a wider range of
patterns than existing object-centric datasets. Our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods on the three benchmarks, RPINE, FSCD-147, and
FSCD-LVIS, and demonstrates strong generalization in cross-dataset evaluation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DEHVF是一种基于动态嵌入和分层视觉特征融合的高效视觉-语言微调方法，通过轻量级分层视觉融合器动态选择和融合与LLM各层语义粒度对应的分层特征，避免序列扩展问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将视觉特征投影后与文本标记拼接，导致输入序列长度显著增加，计算开销大。现有融合方法往往忽视模型内的分层语义表示和浅层视觉编码层中的细粒度视觉信息。

Method: 通过轻量级分层视觉融合器动态选择和融合与LLM各层语义粒度对应的分层视觉特征，将融合后的层相关视觉特征投影对齐后直接嵌入到LLM对应层的FFN中。

Result: 在ScienceQA视觉问答和COCO Captions图像描述等多个VL基准测试中，DEHVF比现有参数高效微调基线实现了更高的准确性，同时保持高效的训练和推理。

Conclusion: DEHVF方法不仅避免了序列扩展问题，还动态融合了多层视觉信息，通过仅微调少量参数实现了跨模态信息在相同语义粒度上的精确对齐和互补。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) commonly follow a paradigm that projects
visual features and then concatenates them with text tokens to form a unified
sequence input for Large Language Models (LLMs). However, this paradigm leads
to a significant increase in the length of the input sequence, resulting in
substantial computational overhead. Existing methods attempt to fuse visual
information into the intermediate layers of LLMs, which alleviate the sequence
length issue but often neglect the hierarchical semantic representations within
the model and the fine-grained visual information available in the shallower
visual encoding layers. To address this limitation, we propose DEHVF, an
efficient vision-language fine-tuning method based on dynamic embedding and
fusion of hierarchical visual features. Its core lies in leveraging the
inherent hierarchical representation characteristics of visual encoders and
language models. Through a lightweight hierarchical visual fuser, it
dynamically selects and fuses hierarchical features corresponding to semantic
granularity based on the internal representations of each layer in LLMs. The
fused layer-related visual features are then projected and aligned before being
directly embedded into the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) of the corresponding
layer in LLMs. This approach not only avoids sequence expansion but also
dynamically fuses multi-layer visual information. By fine-tuning only a small
number of parameters, DEHVF achieves precise alignment and complementarity of
cross-modal information at the same semantic granularity. We conducted
experiments across various VL benchmarks, including visual question answering
on ScienceQA and image captioning on COCO Captions. The results demonstrate
that DEHVF achieves higher accuracy than existing parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) baselines while maintaining efficient training and
inference.

Motivation: 多发性硬化病变纵向分割面临数据和分割输出的严重不平衡问题，现有损失函数（如Dice损失、交叉熵损失）对此处理不足，要么计算复杂，要么在其他指标上表现不佳

Method: 开发名为HyTver的新型混合损失函数，专门针对不平衡问题设计，避免使用复杂的超参数指数计算，同时保持多指标性能

Result: 获得0.659的Dice分数，距离指标与其他流行损失函数相当，在预训练模型上表现出良好的稳定性

Conclusion: HyTver损失函数有效解决了多发性硬化病变分割中的不平衡问题，在多个评估指标上均表现优异，为医学图像分割提供了实用的损失函数解决方案

Abstract: Longitudinal Multiple Sclerosis Lesion Segmentation is a particularly
challenging problem that involves both input and output imbalance in the data
and segmentation. Therefore in order to develop models that are practical, one
of the solutions is to develop better loss functions. Most models naively use
either Dice loss or Cross-Entropy loss or their combination without too much
consideration. However, one must select an appropriate loss function as the
imbalance can be mitigated by selecting a proper loss function. In order to
solve the imbalance problem, multiple loss functions were proposed that claimed
to solve it. They come with problems of their own which include being too
computationally complex due to hyperparameters as exponents or having
detrimental performance in metrics other than region-based ones. We propose a
novel hybrid loss called HyTver that achieves good segmentation performance
while maintaining performance in other metrics. We achieve a Dice score of
0.659 while also ensuring that the distance-based metrics are comparable to
other popular functions. In addition, we also evaluate the stability of the
loss functions when used on a pre- trained model and perform extensive
comparisons with other popular loss functions

Abstract: Early diagnosis of plant diseases is critical for global food safety, yet
most AI solutions lack the generalization required for real-world agricultural
diversity. These models are typically constrained to specific species, failing
to perform accurately across the broad spectrum of cultivated plants. To
address this gap, we first introduce the FloraSyntropy Archive, a large-scale
dataset of 178,922 images across 35 plant species, annotated with 97 distinct
disease classes. We establish a benchmark by evaluating numerous existing
models on this archive, revealing a significant performance gap. We then
propose FloraSyntropy-Net, a novel federated learning framework (FL) that
integrates a Memetic Algorithm (MAO) for optimal base model selection
(DenseNet201), a novel Deep Block for enhanced feature representation, and a
client-cloning strategy for scalable, privacy-preserving training.
FloraSyntropy-Net achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 96.38% on the
FloraSyntropy benchmark. Crucially, to validate its generalization capability,
we test the model on the unrelated multiclass Pest dataset, where it
demonstrates exceptional adaptability, achieving 99.84% accuracy. This work
provides not only a valuable new resource but also a robust and highly
generalizable framework that advances the field towards practical, large-scale
agricultural AI applications.

Abstract: Complex tubular structures are essential in medical imaging and
computer-assisted diagnosis, where their integrity enhances anatomical
visualization and lesion detection. However, existing segmentation algorithms
struggle with structural discontinuities, particularly in severe clinical cases
such as coronary artery stenosis and vessel occlusions, which leads to
undesired discontinuity and compromising downstream diagnostic accuracy.
Therefore, it is imperative to reconnect discontinuous structures to ensure
their completeness. In this study, we explore the tubular structure completion
based on point cloud for the first time and establish a Point Cloud-based
Coronary Artery Completion (PC-CAC) dataset, which is derived from real
clinical data. This dataset provides a novel benchmark for tubular structure
completion. Additionally, we propose TSRNet, a Tubular Structure Reconnection
Network that integrates a detail-preservated feature extractor, a multiple
dense refinement strategy, and a global-to-local loss function to ensure
accurate reconnection while maintaining structural integrity. Comprehensive
experiments on our PC-CAC and two additional public datasets (PC-ImageCAS and
PC-PTR) demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches across multiple evaluation metrics, setting a new benchmark for
point cloud-based tubular structure reconstruction. Our benchmark is available

Abstract: Accurate detection of diseased glomeruli is fundamental to progress in renal
pathology and underpins the delivery of reliable clinical diagnoses. Although
recent advances in computer vision have produced increasingly sophisticated
detection algorithms, the majority of research efforts have focused on normal
glomeruli or instances of global sclerosis, leaving the wider spectrum of
diseased glomerular subtypes comparatively understudied. This disparity is not
without consequence; the nuanced and highly variable morphological
characteristics that define these disease variants frequently elude even the
most advanced computational models. Moreover, ongoing debate surrounds the
choice of optimal imaging magnifications and region-of-view dimensions for
fine-grained glomerular analysis, adding further complexity to the pursuit of
accurate classification and robust segmentation.
  To bridge these gaps, we present M^3-GloDet, a systematic framework designed
to enable thorough evaluation of detection models across a broad continuum of
regions, scales, and classes. Within this framework, we evaluate both
long-standing benchmark architectures and recently introduced state-of-the-art
models that have achieved notable performance, using an experimental design
that reflects the diversity of region-of-interest sizes and imaging resolutions
encountered in routine digital renal pathology. As the results, we found that
intermediate patch sizes offered the best balance between context and
efficiency. Additionally, moderate magnifications enhanced generalization by
reducing overfitting. Through systematic comparison of these approaches on a
multi-class diseased glomerular dataset, our aim is to advance the
understanding of model strengths and limitations, and to offer actionable
insights for the refinement of automated detection strategies and clinical
workflows in the digital pathology domain.

Result: 在三个公开医疗数据集上评估，证明该框架在OOD检测性能上超过现有方法

Conclusion: 该框架通过将多层次视视信息与确定性伪OOD样本生成相结合，有效提升了医疗图像中未知疾病的识别能力，为可靠医疗诊断提供了有力支持

Abstract: In trustworthy medical diagnosis systems, integrating out-of-distribution
(OOD) detection aims to identify unknown diseases in samples, thereby
mitigating the risk of misdiagnosis. In this study, we propose a novel OOD
detection framework based on vision-language models (VLMs), which integrates
hierarchical visual information to cope with challenging unknown diseases that
resemble known diseases. Specifically, a cross-scale visual fusion strategy is
proposed to couple visual embeddings from multiple scales. This enriches the
detailed representation of medical images and thus improves the discrimination
of unknown diseases. Moreover, a cross-scale hard pseudo-OOD sample generation
strategy is proposed to benefit OOD detection maximally. Experimental
evaluations on three public medical datasets support that the proposed
framework achieves superior OOD detection performance compared to existing
methods. The source code is available at https://openi.pcl.ac.cn/OpenMedIA/HVL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在处理长视频时面临注意力机制二次复杂度的挑战，需要更高效的视频令牌处理方法

Method: Language-Guided Temporal Token Pruning (LGTTP)，利用查询中的时间线索自适应剪枝视频令牌，在时间相关片段保持更高令牌密度

Result: 在TimeChat和LLaVA-Video上实现65%计算量减少，性能保持97-99%；QVHighlights上HIT@1提升9.5%，Charades-STA上R@1保持99.6%

Conclusion: LGTTP是一种模型无关的高效框架，在保持性能的同时显著降低计算开销，特别适用于具有明确时间标记的查询和通用视频理解任务

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) struggle with long-form videos due to the
quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms. We propose Language-Guided
Temporal Token Pruning (LGTTP), which leverages temporal cues from queries to
adaptively prune video tokens, preserving contextual continuity while reducing
computational overhead. Unlike uniform pruning or keyframe selection, LGTTP
retains higher token density in temporally relevant segments. Our
model-agnostic framework integrates with TimeChat and LLaVA-Video, achieving a
65% reduction in computation while preserving 97-99% of the original
performance. On QVHighlights, LGTTP improves HIT@1 by +9.5%, and on
Charades-STA, it retains 99.6% of R@1. It excels on queries with explicit
temporal markers and remains effective across general video understanding
tasks.

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has become an essential component
of medical imaging research, aiming to increase transparency and clinical trust
in deep learning models. This study investigates brain hemorrhage diagnosis
with a focus on explainability through Class Activation Mapping (CAM)
techniques. A pipeline was developed to extract pixellevel segmentation and
detection annotations from classification models using nine state-of-the-art
CAM algorithms, applied across multiple network stages, and quantitatively
evaluated on the Hemorica dataset, which uniquely provides both slice-level
labels and high-quality segmentation masks. Metrics including Dice, IoU, and
pixel-wise overlap were employed to benchmark CAM variants. Results show that
the strongest localization performance occurred at stage 5 of EfficientNetV2S,
with HiResCAM yielding the highest bounding-box alignment and AblationCAM
achieving the best pixel-level Dice (0.57) and IoU (0.40), representing strong
accuracy given that models were trained solely for classification without
segmentation supervision. To the best of current knowledge, this is among the f
irst works to quantitatively compare CAM methods for brain hemorrhage
detection, establishing a reproducible benchmark and underscoring the potential
of XAI-driven pipelines for clinically meaningful AI-assisted diagnosis.

Motivation: 超分辨率技术需要提升低分辨率图像质量，现有方法在transformer、扩散模型和GAN之间存在性能差距，需要一种能够整合这些方法优势的新架构。

Method: 提出CATformer网络，采用双分支架构：主分支使用扩散启发的transformer逐步细化潜在表示，辅助分支通过学习的潜在对比增强噪声鲁棒性，最后使用残差密集块进行特征融合和解码。

Result: 在基准数据集上的大量实验表明，CATformer在效率和视觉图像质量方面均优于最近的transformer基和扩散启发方法。

Conclusion: 该工作弥合了transformer、扩散模型和GAN方法之间的性能差距，为扩散启发transformer在超分辨率中的实际应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Super-resolution remains a promising technique to enhance the quality of
low-resolution images. This study introduces CATformer (Contrastive Adversarial
Transformer), a novel neural network integrating diffusion-inspired feature
refinement with adversarial and contrastive learning. CATformer employs a
dual-branch architecture combining a primary diffusion-inspired transformer,
which progressively refines latent representations, with an auxiliary
transformer branch designed to enhance robustness to noise through learned
latent contrasts. These complementary representations are fused and decoded
using deep Residual-in-Residual Dense Blocks for enhanced reconstruction
quality. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that CATformer
outperforms recent transformer-based and diffusion-inspired methods both in
efficiency and visual image quality. This work bridges the performance gap
among transformer-, diffusion-, and GAN-based methods, laying a foundation for
practical applications of diffusion-inspired transformers in super-resolution.

Conclusion: NGD方法有效解决了动态服装重建中的细节建模和变形问题，为单目视频中的动态服装重建提供了高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Dynamic garment reconstruction from monocular video is an important yet
challenging task due to the complex dynamics and unconstrained nature of the
garments. Recent advancements in neural rendering have enabled high-quality
geometric reconstruction with image/video supervision. However, implicit
representation methods that use volume rendering often provide smooth geometry
and fail to model high-frequency details. While template reconstruction methods
model explicit geometry, they use vertex displacement for deformation, which
results in artifacts. Addressing these limitations, we propose NGD, a Neural
Gradient-based Deformation method to reconstruct dynamically evolving textured
garments from monocular videos. Additionally, we propose a novel adaptive
remeshing strategy for modelling dynamically evolving surfaces like wrinkles
and pleats of the skirt, leading to high-quality reconstruction. Finally, we
learn dynamic texture maps to capture per-frame lighting and shadow effects. We
provide extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations to demonstrate
significant improvements over existing SOTA methods and provide high-quality
garment reconstructions.

Motivation: 传统对话检索方法无法满足用户在长对话中找到语义相关内容的需求，尤其是当内容分散在不同话转中时。

Method: 构建MLDR数据集，提出F2RVLM模型，采用两阶段训练范式：监督微调注入片段级别检索知识，以及基于GRPO的增强学习使用多目标奖励。还包括难度感知课程采样技术。

Result: F2RVLM模型在领域内和实际场景中都超越了常见的视觉-语言模型，显示出更优秀的检索性能。

Conclusion: 该研究成功地解决了多模态长对话中细粒度内容检索的挑战，为实际应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Traditional dialogue retrieval aims to select the most appropriate utterance
or image from recent dialogue history. However, they often fail to meet users'
actual needs for revisiting semantically coherent content scattered across
long-form conversations. To fill this gap, we define the Fine-grained Fragment
Retrieval (FFR) task, requiring models to locate query-relevant fragments,
comprising both utterances and images, from multimodal long-form dialogues. As
a foundation for FFR, we construct MLDR, the longest-turn multimodal dialogue
retrieval dataset to date, averaging 25.45 turns per dialogue, with each
naturally spanning three distinct topics. To evaluate generalization in
real-world scenarios, we curate and annotate a WeChat-based test set comprising
real-world multimodal dialogues with an average of 75.38 turns. Building on
these resources, we explore existing generation-based Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) on FFR and observe that they often retrieve incoherent utterance-image
fragments. While optimized for generating responses from visual-textual inputs,
these models lack explicit supervision to ensure semantic coherence within
retrieved fragments. To this end, we propose F2RVLM, a generative retrieval
model trained in a two-stage paradigm: (1) supervised fine-tuning to inject
fragment-level retrieval knowledge, and (2) GRPO-based reinforcement learning
with multi-objective rewards promoting semantic precision, relevance, and
contextual coherence. To handle varying intra-fragment complexity, from locally
dense to sparsely distributed, we introduce difficulty-aware curriculum
sampling that ranks training instances by model-predicted difficulty and
gradually exposes the model to harder samples. This boosts reasoning ability in
long, multi-turn contexts. F2RVLM outperforms popular VLMs in both in-domain
and real-domain settings, demonstrating superior retrieval performance.

Conclusion: 该方法为基于对话的生成和MLLM-扩散模型集成开辟了新可能性，支持多轮交互式精炼和实时上下文感知图像生成

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation has greatly enhanced creative expression, yet
achieving preference-aligned generation in a real-time and training-free manner
remains challenging. Previous methods often rely on static, pre-collected
preferences or fine-tuning, limiting adaptability to evolving and nuanced user
intents. In this paper, we highlight the need for instant preference-aligned
T2I generation and propose a training-free framework grounded in multimodal
large language model (MLLM) priors. Our framework decouples the task into two
components: preference understanding and preference-guided generation. For
preference understanding, we leverage MLLMs to automatically extract global
preference signals from a reference image and enrich a given prompt using
structured instruction design. Our approach supports broader and more
fine-grained coverage of user preferences than existing methods. For
preference-guided generation, we integrate global keyword-based control and
local region-aware cross-attention modulation to steer the diffusion model
without additional training, enabling precise alignment across both global
attributes and local elements. The entire framework supports multi-round
interactive refinement, facilitating real-time and context-aware image
generation. Extensive experiments on the Viper dataset and our collected
benchmark demonstrate that our method outperforms prior approaches in both
quantitative metrics and human evaluations, and opens up new possibilities for
dialog-based generation and MLLM-diffusion integration.

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了少样本人类动作异常检测的挑战，首次将扩散模型增强策略专门用于增强对比学习，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: Human Action Anomaly Detection (HAAD) aims to identify anomalous actions
given only normal action data during training. Existing methods typically
follow a one-model-per-category paradigm, requiring separate training for each
action category and a large number of normal samples. These constraints hinder
scalability and limit applicability in real-world scenarios, where data is
often scarce or novel categories frequently appear. To address these
limitations, we propose a unified framework for HAAD that is compatible with
few-shot scenarios. Our method constructs a category-agnostic representation
space via contrastive learning, enabling AD by comparing test samples with a
given small set of normal examples (referred to as the support set). To improve
inter-category generalization and intra-category robustness, we introduce a
generative motion augmentation strategy harnessing a diffusion-based foundation
model for creating diverse and realistic training samples. Notably, to the best
of our knowledge, our work is the first to introduce such a strategy
specifically tailored to enhance contrastive learning for action AD. Extensive
experiments on the HumanAct12 dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art
effectiveness of our approach under both seen and unseen category settings,
regarding training efficiency and model scalability for few-shot HAAD.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种结合U-Net分割和分类模型的深度学习框架，用于宫颈癌Pap涂片检测。实验结果显示使用分割图像对分类性能的提升有限（精度提高约0.41%，F1分数提高约1.30%）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 宫颈癌是全球女性癌症死亡的主要原因，Pap涂片检测虽然重要但人工检测耗时且易出错，需要自动化辅助工具来提高诊断效率和准确性。

Method: 使用U-Net进行图像分割，然后构建分类模型，在Herlev Pap Smear数据集上训练和评估，比较分割图像和非分割图像对分类性能的影响。

Result: 分割图像仅带来有限的性能提升：精度提高约0.41%，F1分数提高约1.30%，表明分割对分类性能的影响相对有限。

Conclusion: 虽然分割有助于特征提取，但对分类性能的提升作用有限。该框架可作为临床辅助工具，帮助病理学家进行早期诊断。

Abstract: Cervical cancer remains a significant global health concern and a leading
cause of cancer-related deaths among women. Early detection through Pap smear
tests is essential to reduce mortality rates; however, the manual examination
is time consuming and prone to human error. This study proposes a deep learning
framework that integrates U-Net for segmentation and a classification model to
enhance diagnostic performance. The Herlev Pap Smear Dataset, a publicly
available cervical cell dataset, was utilized for training and evaluation. The
impact of segmentation on classification performance was evaluated by comparing
the model trained on segmented images and another trained on non-segmented
images. Experimental results showed that the use of segmented images marginally
improved the model performance on precision (about 0.41 percent higher) and
F1-score (about 1.30 percent higher), which suggests a slightly more balanced
classification performance. While segmentation helps in feature extraction, the
results showed that its impact on classification performance appears to be
limited. The proposed framework offers a supplemental tool for clinical
applications, which may aid pathologists in early diagnosis.

Conclusion: CMFDNet通过创新的模块设计有效解决了结肠息肉分割的关键挑战，在多个基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能表现。

Abstract: Automated colonic polyp segmentation is crucial for assisting doctors in
screening of precancerous polyps and diagnosis of colorectal neoplasms.
Although existing methods have achieved promising results, polyp segmentation
remains hindered by the following limitations,including: (1) significant
variation in polyp shapes and sizes, (2) indistinct boundaries between polyps
and adjacent tissues, and (3) small-sized polyps are easily overlooked during
the segmentation process. Driven by these practical difficulties, an innovative
architecture, CMFDNet, is proposed with the CMD module, MSA module, and FD
module. The CMD module, serving as an innovative decoder, introduces a
cross-scanning method to reduce blurry boundaries. The MSA module adopts a
multi-branch parallel structure to enhance the recognition ability for polyps
with diverse geometries and scale distributions. The FD module establishes
dependencies among all decoder features to alleviate the under-detection of
polyps with small-scale features. Experimental results show that CMFDNet
outperforms six SOTA methods used for comparison, especially on ETIS and
ColonDB datasets, where mDice scores exceed the best SOTA method by 1.83% and
1.55%, respectively.

Abstract: Estimating the 3D pose of a drone is important for anti-drone systems, but
existing methods struggle with the unique challenges of drone keypoint
detection. Drone propellers serve as keypoints but are difficult to detect due
to their high visual similarity and diversity of poses. To address these
challenges, we propose DroneKey, a framework that combines a 2D keypoint
detector and a 3D pose estimator specifically designed for drones. In the
keypoint detection stage, we extract two key-representations (intermediate and
compact) from each transformer encoder layer and optimally combine them using a
gated sum. We also introduce a pose-adaptive Mahalanobis distance in the loss
function to ensure stable keypoint predictions across extreme poses. We built
new datasets of drone 2D keypoints and 3D pose to train and evaluate our
method, which have been publicly released. Experiments show that our method
achieves an AP of 99.68% (OKS) in keypoint detection, outperforming existing
methods. Ablation studies confirm that the pose-adaptive Mahalanobis loss
function improves keypoint prediction stability and accuracy. Additionally,
improvements in the encoder design enable real-time processing at 44 FPS. For
3D pose estimation, our method achieved an MAE-angle of 10.62{\deg}, an RMSE of
0.221m, and an MAE-absolute of 0.076m, demonstrating high accuracy and
reliability. The code and dataset are available at

Result: 研究发现偏见测量高度依赖数据子集选择，预训练偏见与下游偏见之间难以发现一致的趋势，且不同预训练CLIP模型在下游任务适应时表征空间趋于收敛，导致偏见转移的不一致性。

Conclusion: 这项工作为偏见行为提供了重要见解，为未来研究促进更好的偏见缓解实践提供了信息，表明需要重新思考当前的偏见评估和缓解方法。

Abstract: The recycling of contrastive language-image pre-trained (CLIP) models as
backbones for a large number of downstream tasks calls for a thorough analysis
of their transferability implications, especially their well-documented
reproduction of social biases and human stereotypes. How do such biases,
learned during pre-training, propagate to downstream applications like visual
question answering or image captioning? Do they transfer at all?
  We investigate this phenomenon, referred to as bias transfer in prior
literature, through a comprehensive empirical analysis. Firstly, we examine how
pre-training bias varies between global and local views of data, finding that
bias measurement is highly dependent on the subset of data on which it is
computed. Secondly, we analyze correlations between biases in the pre-trained
models and the downstream tasks across varying levels of pre-training bias,
finding difficulty in discovering consistent trends in bias transfer. Finally,
we explore why this inconsistency occurs, showing that under the current
paradigm, representation spaces of different pre-trained CLIPs tend to converge
when adapted for downstream tasks. We hope this work offers valuable insights
into bias behavior and informs future research to promote better bias
mitigation practices.

Abstract: In Text-to-Image (T2I) generation, the complexity of entities and their
intricate interactions pose a significant challenge for T2I method based on
diffusion model: how to effectively control entity and their interactions to
produce high-quality images. To address this, we propose CEIDM, a image
generation method based on diffusion model with dual controls for entity and
interaction. First, we propose an entity interactive relationships mining
approach based on Large Language Models (LLMs), extracting reasonable and rich
implicit interactive relationships through chain of thought to guide diffusion
models to generate high-quality images that are closer to realistic logic and
have more reasonable interactive relationships. Furthermore, We propose an
interactive action clustering and offset method to cluster and offset the
interactive action features contained in each text prompts. By constructing
global and local bidirectional offsets, we enhance semantic understanding and
detail supplementation of original actions, making the model's understanding of
the concept of interactive "actions" more accurate and generating images with
more accurate interactive actions. Finally, we design an entity control network
which generates masks with entity semantic guidance, then leveraging
multi-scale convolutional network to enhance entity feature and dynamic network
to fuse feature. It effectively controls entities and significantly improves
image quality. Experiments show that the proposed CEIDM method is better than
the most representative existing methods in both entity control and their
interaction control.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is fundamental for ensuring quality control and operational
efficiency in industrial environments, yet conventional approaches face
significant challenges when training data contains mislabeled samples-a common
occurrence in real-world scenarios. This paper presents RAD, a robust anomaly
detection framework that integrates Normalizing Flows with Model-Agnostic
Meta-Learning to address the critical challenge of label noise in industrial

meta-learning enables rapid adaptation to varying noise conditions, while
uncertainty quantification guides adaptive L2 regularization to maintain model
stability. The framework incorporates multiscale feature processing through
pretrained feature extractors and leverages the precise likelihood estimation

evaluation on MVTec-AD and KSDD2 datasets demonstrates superior performance,
achieving I-AUROC scores of 95.4% and 94.6% respectively under clean
conditions, while maintaining robust detection capabilities above 86.8% and
92.1% even when 50% of training samples are mislabeled. The results highlight
RAD's exceptional resilience to noisy training conditions and its ability to
detect subtle anomalies across diverse industrial scenarios, making it a
practical solution for real-world anomaly detection applications where perfect
data curation is challenging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主流细胞分割网络依赖距离图预测，需要完全标注的数据集，这限制了训练集的生成和迁移学习，因此需要能够处理部分标注对象的方法

Method: 提出了一种仍然基于距离图但能够处理部分标注对象的方法，并集成到用户友好的Napari插件中

Result: 实验表明该方法在节约学习、迁移学习和常规学习中都能显著节省时间和资源，同时不牺牲分割质量

Conclusion: 该方法解决了完全标注数据集的限制问题，为细胞分割提供了更高效实用的解决方案

Abstract: The most popular networks used for cell segmentation (e.g. Cellpose,
Stardist, HoverNet,...) rely on a prediction of a distance map. It yields
unprecedented accuracy but hinges on fully annotated datasets. This is a
serious limitation to generate training sets and perform transfer learning. In
this paper, we propose a method that still relies on the distance map and
handles partially annotated objects. We evaluate the performance of the
proposed approach in the contexts of frugal learning, transfer learning and
regular learning on regular databases. Our experiments show that it can lead to
substantial savings in time and resources without sacrificing segmentation
quality. The proposed algorithm is embedded in a user-friendly Napari plugin.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视视觉语言模型中的视觉刷选通常使用文本-视觉注意力分数作为标准，但序列模型的近期偏差导致图像底部区域的视觉token获得过高的注意力分数，从而影响刷选效果

Method: 提出位置重新加权视觉token剧选方法，通过根据视觉token在图像中的空间位置来调整其注意力分数，是一种即插即用的解决方案

Result: 实验结果显示该方法在最小计算开销下显著提高了视觉token剧选的性能

Conclusion: 该方法有效减轻了视视觉语言模型中的近期偏差问题，为视觉token剧选提供了一种简单但高效的改进方案

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) typically process a significantly larger number
of visual tokens compared to text tokens due to the inherent redundancy in
visual signals. Visual token pruning is a promising direction to reduce the
computational cost of VLMs by eliminating redundant visual tokens. The
text-visual attention score is a widely adopted criterion for visual token
pruning as it reflects the relevance of visual tokens to the text input.
However, many sequence models exhibit a recency bias, where tokens appearing
later in the sequence exert a disproportionately large influence on the model's
output. In VLMs, this bias manifests as inflated attention scores for tokens
corresponding to the lower regions of the image, leading to suboptimal pruning
that disproportionately retains tokens from the image bottom. In this paper, we
present an extremely simple yet effective approach to alleviate the recency
bias in visual token pruning. We propose a straightforward reweighting
mechanism that adjusts the attention scores of visual tokens according to their
spatial positions in the image. Our method, termed Position-reweighted Visual
Token Pruning, is a plug-and-play solution that can be seamlessly incorporated
into existing visual token pruning frameworks without any changes to the model
architecture or extra training. Extensive experiments on LVLMs demonstrate that
our method improves the performance of visual token pruning with minimal
computational overhead.

Conclusion: UniSino通过直接在投影域处理数据，为CT投影数据标准化提供了一个有效的通用解决方案，具有强大的泛化能力和实际应用价值。

Abstract: During raw-data acquisition in CT imaging, diverse factors can degrade the
collected sinograms, with undersampling and noise leading to severe artifacts
and noise in reconstructed images and compromising diagnostic accuracy.
Conventional correction methods rely on manually designed algorithms or fixed
empirical parameters, but these approaches often lack generalizability across
heterogeneous artifact types. To address these limitations, we propose UniSino,
a foundation model for universal CT sinogram standardization. Unlike existing
foundational models that operate in image domain, UniSino directly standardizes
data in the projection domain, which enables stronger generalization across
diverse undersampling scenarios. Its training framework incorporates the
physical characteristics of sinograms, enhancing generalization and enabling
robust performance across multiple subtasks spanning four benchmark datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate thatUniSino achieves superior reconstruction
quality both single and mixed undersampling case, demonstrating exceptional
robustness and generalization in sinogram enhancement for CT imaging. The code

Abstract: Existing multi-modal fusion methods typically apply static frame-based image
fusion techniques directly to video fusion tasks, neglecting inherent temporal
dependencies and leading to inconsistent results across frames. To address this
limitation, we propose the first video fusion framework that explicitly
incorporates temporal modeling with visual-semantic collaboration to
simultaneously ensure visual fidelity, semantic accuracy, and temporal
consistency. First, we introduce a visual-semantic interaction module
consisting of a semantic branch and a visual branch, with Dinov2 and VGG19
employed for targeted distillation, allowing simultaneous enhancement of both
the visual and semantic representations. Second, we pioneer integrate the video
degradation enhancement task into the video fusion pipeline by constructing a
temporal cooperative module, which leverages temporal dependencies to
facilitate weak information recovery. Third, to ensure temporal consistency, we
embed a temporal-enhanced mechanism into the network and devise a temporal loss
to guide the optimization process. Finally, we introduce two innovative
evaluation metrics tailored for video fusion, aimed at assessing the temporal
consistency of the generated fused videos. Extensive experimental results on
public video datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method. Our code is

Abstract: Industrial and medical anomaly detection faces critical challenges from data
scarcity and prohibitive annotation costs, particularly in evolving
manufacturing and healthcare settings. To address this, we propose CoZAD, a
novel zero-shot anomaly detection framework that integrates soft confident
learning with meta-learning and contrastive feature representation. Unlike
traditional confident learning that discards uncertain samples, our method
assigns confidence-based weights to all training data, preserving boundary
information while emphasizing prototypical normal patterns. The framework
quantifies data uncertainty through IQR-based thresholding and model
uncertainty via covariance based regularization within a Model-Agnostic
Meta-Learning. Contrastive learning creates discriminative feature spaces where
normal patterns form compact clusters, enabling rapid domain adaptation.
Comprehensive evaluation across 10 datasets spanning industrial and medical
domains demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing
methods on 6 out of 7 industrial benchmarks with notable improvements on
texture-rich datasets (99.2% I-AUROC on DTD-Synthetic, 97.2% on BTAD) and
pixellevel localization (96.3% P-AUROC on MVTec-AD). The framework eliminates
dependence on vision-language alignments or model ensembles, making it valuable

Abstract: Realistic 3D indoor scene generation is crucial for virtual reality, interior
design, embodied intelligence, and scene understanding. While existing methods
have made progress in coarse-scale furniture arrangement, they struggle to
capture fine-grained object placements, limiting the realism and utility of
generated environments. This gap hinders immersive virtual experiences and
detailed scene comprehension for embodied AI applications. To address these
issues, we propose Hierarchical Layout Generation (HLG), a novel method for
fine-grained 3D scene generation. HLG is the first to adopt a coarse-to-fine
hierarchical approach, refining scene layouts from large-scale furniture
placement to intricate object arrangements. Specifically, our fine-grained
layout alignment module constructs a hierarchical layout through vertical and
horizontal decoupling, effectively decomposing complex 3D indoor scenes into
multiple levels of granularity. Additionally, our trainable layout optimization
network addresses placement issues, such as incorrect positioning, orientation
errors, and object intersections, ensuring structurally coherent and physically
plausible scene generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
through extensive experiments, showing superior performance in generating
realistic indoor scenes compared to existing methods. This work advances the
field of scene generation and opens new possibilities for applications
requiring detailed 3D environments. We will release our code upon publication
to encourage future research.

Result: 在伪装目标检测领域超越之前的半监督方法，达到最先进性能

Conclusion: SCOUT方法有效提升了半监督伪装目标检测的性能，通过更好的未标注数据利用和文本-视觉融合实现了显著改进

Abstract: The difficulty of pixel-level annotation has significantly hindered the
development of the Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) field. To save on
annotation costs, previous works leverage the semi-supervised COD framework
that relies on a small number of labeled data and a large volume of unlabeled
data. We argue that there is still significant room for improvement in the
effective utilization of unlabeled data. To this end, we introduce a
Semi-supervised Camouflaged Object Detection by Utilizing Text and Adaptive
Data Selection (SCOUT). It includes an Adaptive Data Augment and Selection
(ADAS) module and a Text Fusion Module (TFM). The ADSA module selects valuable
data for annotation through an adversarial augment and sampling strategy. The
TFM module further leverages the selected valuable data by combining
camouflage-related knowledge and text-visual interaction. To adapt to this
work, we build a new dataset, namely RefTextCOD. Extensive experiments show
that the proposed method surpasses previous semi-supervised methods in the COD
field and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our code will be released at

Abstract: Medical image segmentation models struggle with rare abnormalities due to
scarce annotated pathological data. We propose DiffAug a novel framework that
combines textguided diffusion-based generation with automatic segmentation
validation to address this challenge. Our proposed approach uses latent
diffusion models conditioned on medical text descriptions and spatial masks to
synthesize abnormalities via inpainting on normal images. Generated samples
undergo dynamic quality validation through a latentspace segmentation network
that ensures accurate localization while enabling single-step inference. The
text prompts, derived from medical literature, guide the generation of diverse
abnormality types without requiring manual annotation. Our validation mechanism
filters synthetic samples based on spatial accuracy, maintaining quality while
operating efficiently through direct latent estimation. Evaluated on three
medical imaging benchmarks (CVC-ClinicDB, Kvasir-SEG, REFUGE2), our framework
achieves state-of-the-art performance with 8-10% Dice improvements over

Motivation: 预训练视觉语言模型在零样本泛化方面表现出色，但提示调优的泛化能力有限。标签平滑作为有效的正则化技术可以提升泛化能力，但在提示调优中反而会削弱性能。

Method: ATLaS方法交替使用标准one-hot标签和标签平滑生成的软标签来监督提示调优。提出了两种高效的离线软标签：类间软标签(CSL)和实例类软标签(ISL)，分别提供类间和实例-类关系。

Conclusion: ATLaS方法有效解决了标签平滑在提示调优中的负面效应，通过交替训练策略和高效的软标签设计显著提升了提示调优的泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained vision-language models have demonstrated
remarkable zero-shot generalization capabilities. To further enhance these
models' adaptability to various downstream tasks, prompt tuning has emerged as
a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method. However, despite its efficiency, the
generalization ability of prompt remains limited. In contrast, label smoothing
(LS) has been widely recognized as an effective regularization technique that
prevents models from becoming over-confident and improves their generalization.
This inspires us to explore the integration of LS with prompt tuning. However,
we have observed that the vanilla LS even weakens the generalization ability of
prompt tuning. To address this issue, we propose the Alternating Training-based
Label Smoothing (ATLaS) method, which alternately trains with standard one-hot
labels and soft labels generated by LS to supervise the prompt tuning.
Moreover, we introduce two types of efficient offline soft labels, including
Class-wise Soft Labels (CSL) and Instance-wise Soft Labels (ISL), to provide
inter-class or instance-class relationships for prompt tuning. The theoretical
properties of the proposed ATLaS method are analyzed. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that the proposed ATLaS method, combined with CSL and ISL,
consistently enhances the generalization performance of prompt tuning.
Moreover, the proposed ATLaS method exhibits high compatibility with prevalent
prompt tuning methods, enabling seamless integration into existing methods.

Conclusion: 所提出的类别平衡采样和软伪标签策略能有效改善目标检测主动学习中的类别不平衡问题，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Training deep object detectors demands expensive bounding box annotation.
Active learning (AL) is a promising technique to alleviate the annotation
burden. Performing AL at box-level for object detection, i.e., selecting the
most informative boxes to label and supplementing the sparsely-labelled image
with pseudo labels, has been shown to be more cost-effective than selecting and
labelling the entire image. In box-level AL for object detection, we observe
that models at early stage can only perform well on majority classes, making
the pseudo labels severely class-imbalanced. We propose a class-balanced
sampling strategy to select more objects from minority classes for labelling,
so as to make the final training data, \ie, ground truth labels obtained by AL
and pseudo labels, more class-balanced to train a better model. We also propose
a task-aware soft pseudo labelling strategy to increase the accuracy of pseudo
labels. We evaluate our method on public benchmarking datasets and show that
our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: VISA方法通过创新的图聚合和分组选择机制，有效解决了MLLMs中视觉token压缩问题，为高效多模态推理提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel method called group-wise \textbf{VI}sual
token \textbf{S}election and \textbf{A}ggregation (VISA) to address the issue
of inefficient inference stemming from excessive visual tokens in multimoal
large language models (MLLMs). Compared with previous token pruning approaches,
our method can preserve more visual information while compressing visual
tokens. We first propose a graph-based visual token aggregation (VTA) module.
VTA treats each visual token as a node, forming a graph based on semantic
similarity among visual tokens. It then aggregates information from removed
tokens into kept tokens based on this graph, producing a more compact visual
token representation. Additionally, we introduce a group-wise token selection
strategy (GTS) to divide visual tokens into kept and removed ones, guided by
text tokens from the final layers of each group. This strategy progressively
aggregates visual information, enhancing the stability of the visual
information extraction process. We conduct comprehensive experiments on
LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-NeXT, and Video-LLaVA across various benchmarks to validate
the efficacy of VISA. Our method consistently outperforms previous methods,
achieving a superior trade-off between model performance and inference speed.

Abstract: The advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has driven
significant progress in Visual Question Answering (VQA), evolving from Single
to Multi Image VQA (MVQA). However, the increased number of images in MVQA
inevitably introduces substantial visual redundancy that is irrelevant to
question answering, negatively impacting both accuracy and efficiency. To
address this issue, existing methods lack flexibility in controlling the number
of compressed visual tokens and tend to produce discrete visual fragments,
which hinder MLLMs' ability to comprehend images holistically. In this paper,
we propose a straightforward yet universal Adaptive Visual Anchoring strategy,
which can be seamlessly integrated into existing MLLMs, offering significant
accuracy improvements through adaptive compression. Meanwhile, to balance the
results derived from both global and compressed visual input, we further
introduce a novel collaborative decoding mechanism, enabling optimal
performance. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method,
demonstrating consistent performance improvements across various MLLMs. The
code will be publicly available.

Result: 在7-Scenes和Cambridge数据集上较现有方法显著提升精度，平移和旋转误差减少40-57%

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种轻量级、无需重新训练的相机位姿精细方案，适用于多样化场景

Abstract: Camera pose refinement aims at improving the accuracy of initial pose
estimation for applications in 3D computer vision. Most refinement approaches
rely on 2D-3D correspondences with specific descriptors or dedicated networks,
requiring reconstructing the scene again for a different descriptor or fully
retraining the network for each scene. Some recent methods instead infer pose
from feature similarity, but their lack of geometry constraints results in less
accuracy. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel camera pose
refinement framework leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), referred to as
GS-SMC. Given the widespread usage of 3DGS, our method can employ an existing
3DGS model to render novel views, providing a lightweight solution that can be
directly applied to diverse scenes without additional training or fine-tuning.
Specifically, we introduce an iterative optimization approach, which refines
the camera pose using epipolar geometric constraints among the query and
multiple rendered images. Our method allows flexibly choosing feature
extractors and matchers to establish these constraints. Extensive empirical
evaluations on the 7-Scenes and the Cambridge Landmarks datasets demonstrate
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art camera pose refinement approaches,
achieving 53.3% and 56.9% reductions in median translation and rotation errors
on 7-Scenes, and 40.7% and 53.2% on Cambridge.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has led to a growing prevalence of
highly realistic AI-generated images, posing significant challenges for digital
forensics and content authentication. Conventional detection methods mainly
rely on deep learning models that extract global features, which often overlook
subtle structural inconsistencies and demand substantial computational
resources. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid detection
framework that combines a fine-tuned Vision Transformer (ViT) with a novel
edge-based image processing module. The edge-based module computes variance
from edge-difference maps generated before and after smoothing, exploiting the
observation that AI-generated images typically exhibit smoother textures,
weaker edges, and reduced noise compared to real images. When applied as a
post-processing step on ViT predictions, this module enhances sensitivity to
fine-grained structural cues while maintaining computational efficiency.
Extensive experiments on the CIFAKE, Artistic, and Custom Curated datasets
demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior detection performance
across all benchmarks, attaining 97.75% accuracy and a 97.77% F1-score on

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ISALux是一种基于Transformer的低光照图像增强方法，通过整合光照和语义先验，采用混合光照语义感知自注意力机制和MoE前馈网络，在多个数据集上达到SOTA水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低光照图像增强中光照模式和语义信息整合不足的问题，以及现有方法在基准数据集上由于不同光照模式导致的过拟合问题。

Method: 提出HISA-MSA自注意力块整合光照和语义分割图，使用两个自注意力模块独立处理光照和语义特征，采用MoE-based FFN增强上下文学习，并引入LoRA技术防止过拟合。

Result: 在多个专业数据集上的定性和定量评估表明，ISALux与最先进方法具有竞争力，消融研究验证了各组件的重要性。

Conclusion: ISALux通过有效整合光照和语义先验，提供了一种强大的低光照图像增强解决方案，代码将在发表后发布。

Abstract: We introduce ISALux, a novel transformer-based approach for Low-Light Image
Enhancement (LLIE) that seamlessly integrates illumination and semantic priors.
Our architecture includes an original self-attention block, Hybrid Illumination
and Semantics-Aware Multi-Headed Self- Attention (HISA-MSA), which integrates
illumination and semantic segmentation maps for en- hanced feature extraction.
ISALux employs two self-attention modules to independently process illumination
and semantic features, selectively enriching each other to regulate luminance
and high- light structural variations in real-world scenarios. A Mixture of
Experts (MoE)-based Feed-Forward Network (FFN) enhances contextual learning,
with a gating mechanism conditionally activating the top K experts for
specialized processing. To address overfitting in LLIE methods caused by
distinct light patterns in benchmarking datasets, we enhance the HISA-MSA
module with low-rank matrix adaptations (LoRA). Extensive qualitative and
quantitative evaluations across multiple specialized datasets demonstrate that
ISALux is competitive with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Addition- ally, an
ablation study highlights the contribution of each component in the proposed
model. Code will be released upon publication.

TL;DR: UniAPO是首个针对多模态自动提示优化的统一框架，通过EM启发式优化过程和长短时记忆机制，解决了视觉令牌膨胀和过程级监督缺失的问题，在文本、图像和视频基准测试中均取得显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动提示优化方法主要针对纯文本场景，扩展到多模态任务时面临两个核心挑战：视觉令牌膨胀导致上下文容量受限和反馈信号不足，以及缺乏过程级监督限制了提示优化的效果。

Method: 采用EM启发式优化过程，将反馈建模和提示优化解耦；引入长短时记忆机制，历史反馈缓解上下文限制，历史提示提供方向性指导。

Result: 在文本、图像和视频基准测试中均取得一致性的性能提升，建立了高效且可迁移的提示优化统一框架。

Conclusion: UniAPO成功解决了多模态自动提示优化的核心挑战，为多模态任务提供了稳定、目标驱动的提示优化解决方案，具有很好的通用性和迁移性。

Abstract: Prompting is fundamental to unlocking the full potential of large language
models. To automate and enhance this process, automatic prompt optimization
(APO) has been developed, demonstrating effectiveness primarily in text-only
input scenarios. However, extending existing APO methods to multimodal tasks,
such as video-language generation introduces two core challenges: (i) visual
token inflation, where long visual token sequences restrict context capacity
and result in insufficient feedback signals; (ii) a lack of process-level
supervision, as existing methods focus on outcome-level supervision and
overlook intermediate supervision, limiting prompt optimization. We present
UniAPO: Unified Multimodal Automated Prompt Optimization, the first framework
tailored for multimodal APO. UniAPO adopts an EM-inspired optimization process
that decouples feedback modeling and prompt refinement, making the optimization
more stable and goal-driven. To further address the aforementioned challenges,
we introduce a short-long term memory mechanism: historical feedback mitigates
context limitations, while historical prompts provide directional guidance for
effective prompt optimization. UniAPO achieves consistent gains across text,
image, and video benchmarks, establishing a unified framework for efficient and
transferable prompt optimization.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究视觉语音识别(VSR)系统的轻量级架构，通过采用高效的图像分类模型和轻量块设计来降低硬件成本，使得VSR系统更适合资源受限的实际应用场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然深度网络在VSR中表现出色，但计算成本高、硬件要求高，导致在资源受限的实际场景中应用有限，承载性低。需要开发轻量化架构以推广VSR系统的应用范围。

Method: 采用标准的双网络设计范式：一个网络负责视觉特征提取，另一个负责利用特征进行序列分类。首先基于图像分类领域的高效模型进行基准测试，然后在时间卷积网络背榜中采用轻量块设计。开发了多个统一的低资源需求模型。

Result: 在最大的公共英语单词数据库上进行实验，证明了所开发模型的有效性和实用性，在保持强大识别性能的同时低资源需求。

Conclusion: 成功开发了轻量级的结构化VSR架构，能够在低硬件成本下实现强大的识别性能，为VSR系统在实际应用场景中的更广泛部署提供了可行解决方案。代码和模型将公开。

Abstract: Visual speech recognition (VSR) systems decode spoken words from an input
sequence using only the video data. Practical applications of such systems
include medical assistance as well as human-machine interactions. A VSR system
is typically employed in a complementary role in cases where the audio is
corrupt or not available. In order to accurately predict the spoken words,
these architectures often rely on deep neural networks in order to extract
meaningful representations from the input sequence. While deep architectures
achieve impressive recognition performance, relying on such models incurs
significant computation costs which translates into increased resource demands
in terms of hardware requirements and results in limited applicability in
real-world scenarios where resources might be constrained. This factor prevents
wider adoption and deployment of speech recognition systems in more practical
applications. In this work, we aim to alleviate this issue by developing
architectures for VSR that have low hardware costs. Following the standard
two-network design paradigm, where one network handles visual feature
extraction and another one utilizes the extracted features to classify the
entire sequence, we develop lightweight end-to-end architectures by first
benchmarking efficient models from the image classification literature, and
then adopting lightweight block designs in a temporal convolution network
backbone. We create several unified models with low resource requirements but
strong recognition performance. Experiments on the largest public database for
English words demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our developed
models. Code and trained models will be made publicly available.

Motivation: 现有单目深度估计技术在手术环境中由于光照变化和复杂纹理而表现有限，视觉基础模型在自然图像上训练导致领域适应性不足和语义感知缺陷。

Method: 整合双基础模型利用预学习先验，采用随机向量低秩自适应(RVLoRA)进行自适应微调，基于深度可分离卷积的残差块(Res-DSC)捕获细粒度特征，设计掩码引导平滑度损失确保解剖组织内的深度一致性。

Abstract: Depth estimation is a foundational component for 3D reconstruction in
minimally invasive endoscopic surgeries. However, existing monocular depth
estimation techniques often exhibit limited performance to the varying
illumination and complex textures of the surgical environment. While powerful
visual foundation models offer a promising solution, their training on natural
images leads to significant domain adaptability limitations and semantic
perception deficiencies when applied to endoscopy. In this study, we introduce
EndoUFM, an unsupervised monocular depth estimation framework that innovatively
integrating dual foundation models for surgical scenes, which enhance the depth
estimation performance by leveraging the powerful pre-learned priors. The
framework features a novel adaptive fine-tuning strategy that incorporates
Random Vector Low-Rank Adaptation (RVLoRA) to enhance model adaptability, and a
Residual block based on Depthwise Separable Convolution (Res-DSC) to improve
the capture of fine-grained local features. Furthermore, we design a
mask-guided smoothness loss to enforce depth consistency within anatomical
tissue structures. Extensive experiments on the SCARED, Hamlyn, SERV-CT, and
EndoNeRF datasets confirm that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
while maintaining an efficient model size. This work contributes to augmenting
surgeons' spatial perception during minimally invasive procedures, thereby
enhancing surgical precision and safety, with crucial implications for
augmented reality and navigation systems.

Abstract: Progress in remote PhotoPlethysmoGraphy (rPPG) is limited by the critical
issues of existing publicly available datasets: small size, privacy concerns
with facial videos, and lack of diversity in conditions. The paper introduces a
novel comprehensive large-scale multi-view video dataset for rPPG and health
biomarkers estimation. Our dataset comprises 3600 synchronized video recordings
from 600 subjects, captured under varied conditions (resting and post-exercise)
using multiple consumer-grade cameras at different angles. To enable multimodal
analysis of physiological states, each recording is paired with a 100 Hz PPG
signal and extended health metrics, such as electrocardiogram, arterial blood
pressure, biomarkers, temperature, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, and
stress level. Using this data, we train an efficient rPPG model and compare its
quality with existing approaches in cross-dataset scenarios. The public release
of our dataset and model should significantly speed up the progress in the
development of AI medical assistants.

TL;DR: CAVIA是一个无需训练的视频理解框架，通过推理-感知协同机制动态协调视觉注意力，在多个基准测试中实现最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前长视频问答系统采用刚性流水线，将推理与感知解耦，导致信息丢失或计算效率低下。核心问题在于无法根据特定推理需求自适应提取视觉证据

Method: CAVIA采用闭环系统：1）分层推理引导精确定位到具体帧；2）跨模态语义桥接进行目标提取；3）置信度驱动的迭代合成

Result: 在EgoSchema（65.7%，+5.3%）、NExT-QA（76.1%，+2.6%）和IntentQA（73.8%，+6.9%）等基准测试中达到最先进性能

Conclusion: 动态推理-感知协调为视频理解提供了可扩展的范式，证明了自适应视觉提取对复杂视频问答任务的重要性

Abstract: Human video comprehension demonstrates dynamic coordination between reasoning
and visual attention, adaptively focusing on query-relevant details. However,
current long-form video question answering systems employ rigid pipelines that
decouple reasoning from perception, leading to either information loss through
premature visual abstraction or computational inefficiency through exhaustive
processing. The core limitation lies in the inability to adapt visual
extraction to specific reasoning requirements, different queries demand
fundamentally different visual evidence from the same video content. In this
work, we present CAVIA, a training-free framework that revolutionizes video
understanding through reasoning, perception coordination. Unlike conventional
approaches where visual processing operates independently of reasoning, CAVIA
creates a closed-loop system where reasoning continuously guides visual
extraction based on identified information gaps. CAVIA introduces three
innovations: (1) hierarchical reasoning, guided localization to precise frames;
(2) cross-modal semantic bridging for targeted extraction; (3)
confidence-driven iterative synthesis. CAVIA achieves state-of-the-art
performance on challenging benchmarks: EgoSchema (65.7%, +5.3%), NExT-QA
(76.1%, +2.6%), and IntentQA (73.8%, +6.9%), demonstrating that dynamic
reasoning-perception coordination provides a scalable paradigm for video
understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探索如何通过结合体积上下文信息来改进临床CT扫描中稀疏采样伪影校正任务的模型性能，特别是比较不同光束几何形状和数据维度的影响。

Method: 使用22名受试者的临床CT数据，通过Astra工具箱模拟平行、扇形和锥形光束几何形状的稀疏采样CT体积。训练和验证2D和3D U-Net模型，比较2D、2.5D和3D数据维度的性能，使用MSE和SSIM作为评估指标。

Result: 对于所有光束几何形状，在轴向2D切片上训练的2D U-Net获得了最佳的MSE和SSIM值，表现优于2.5D和3D输入数据维度。

Conclusion: 尽管尝试了多种数据维度和光束几何形状，但传统的2D U-Net在轴向切片上的处理仍然是最有效的稀疏采样伪影校正方法，3D上下文信息并未带来预期的性能提升。

Abstract: This study aims to investigate the effect of various beam geometries and
dimensions of input data on the sparse-sampling streak artifact correction task
with U-Nets for clinical CT scans as a means of incorporating the volumetric
context into artifact reduction tasks to improve model performance. A total of
22 subjects were retrospectively selected (01.2016-12.2018) from the Technical
University of Munich's research hospital, TUM Klinikum rechts der Isar.
Sparsely-sampled CT volumes were simulated with the Astra toolbox for parallel,
fan, and cone beam geometries. 2048 views were taken as full-view scans. 2D and
3D U-Nets were trained and validated on 14, and tested on 8 subjects,
respectively. For the dimensionality study, in addition to the 512x512 2D CT
images, the CT scans were further pre-processed to generate a so-called '2.5D',
and 3D data: Each CT volume was divided into 64x64x64 voxel blocks. The 3D data
refers to individual 64-voxel blocks. An axial, coronal, and sagittal cut
through the center of each block resulted in three 64x64 2D patches that were
rearranged as a single 64x64x3 image, proposed as 2.5D data. Model performance
was assessed with the mean squared error (MSE) and structural similarity index
measure (SSIM). For all geometries, the 2D U-Net trained on axial 2D slices
results in the best MSE and SSIM values, outperforming the 2.5D and 3D input
data dimensions.

Method: 首先从锚点图像子集计算神经场景表示，然后微调回归网络以基于该神经场景表示重建所有输入图像。结合了场景回归和视觉定位能力。

Result: 在TUM-RGBD、CO3Dv2和Tanks & Temples等基准测试中，不仅在相机姿态估计方面达到最先进水平，还在新视角合成方面表现优异，且能高效扩展到大规模场景。

Conclusion: SAIL-Recon成功解决了大规模SfM问题，通过神经场景表示和条件重建的方法，在保持高性能的同时实现了对大量输入图像的有效处理，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Scene regression methods, such as VGGT, solve the Structure-from-Motion (SfM)
problem by directly regressing camera poses and 3D scene structures from input
images. They demonstrate impressive performance in handling images under
extreme viewpoint changes. However, these methods struggle to handle a large
number of input images. To address this problem, we introduce SAIL-Recon, a
feed-forward Transformer for large scale SfM, by augmenting the scene
regression network with visual localization capabilities. Specifically, our
method first computes a neural scene representation from a subset of anchor
images. The regression network is then fine-tuned to reconstruct all input
images conditioned on this neural scene representation. Comprehensive
experiments show that our method not only scales efficiently to large-scale
scenes, but also achieves state-of-the-art results on both camera pose
estimation and novel view synthesis benchmarks, including TUM-RGBD, CO3Dv2, and
Tanks & Temples. We will publish our model and code. Code and models are

Motivation: 自动驾驶安全需要高精度目标检测，但恶劣天气和低光照等条件会导致数据漂移，降低模型性能和安全性能。ISO 8800标准提供了AI风险管理框架，但需要具体技术解决方案。

Method: 使用数千张道路环境合成图像训练混合架构，采用YOLOv8进行快速检测，结合5层CNN进行验证，两种模型按顺序工作形成双模式框架。

Abstract: The use of computer vision in automotive is a trending research in which
safety and security are a primary concern. In particular, for autonomous
driving, preventing road accidents requires highly accurate object detection
under diverse conditions. To address this issue, recently the International
Organization for Standardization (ISO) released the 8800 norm, providing
structured frameworks for managing associated AI relevant risks. However,
challenging scenarios such as adverse weather or low lighting often introduce
data drift, leading to degraded model performance and potential safety
violations. In this work, we present a novel hybrid computer vision
architecture trained with thousands of synthetic image data from the road
environment to improve robustness in unseen drifted environments. Our dual mode
framework utilized YOLO version 8 for swift detection and incorporated a
five-layer CNN for verification. The system functioned in sequence and improved
the detection accuracy by more than 90\% when tested with drift-augmented road
images. The focus was to demonstrate how such a hybrid model can provide better
road safety when working together in a hybrid structure.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的跨域蓄约(CDD)框架，通过域特异训练和跨域知识聚合，解决了全无监督异常检测(FUAD)中知识蓄约方法可能学习到异常表征的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实际应用中训练集往往包含异常样本，但传统无监督异常检测(UAD)假设训练集为正常样本。FUAD要求在训练集包含异常的情况下仍能检测异常，而传统知识蓄约方法可能会让学生模型学习到教师模型对异常的表征，导致检测性能下降。

Method: 提出跨域蓄约(CDD)框架：1)域特异训练：将训练集分割成多个异常比例较低的域，为每个域训练特定学生模型；2)跨域知识聚合：利用各域特定学生生成的伪正常特征，协同指导一个全局学生模型学习跨越所有样本的普遍正常表征。

Result: 在MVTec AD和VisA数据集的噪声版本上进行实验，方法较基线实现了显著的性能提升，验证了其在FUAD设置下的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究成功将知识蓄约模式引入FUAD领域，并通过创新的跨域蓄约框架有效解决了训练数据中存在异常样本带来的挑战，为实际应用中的异常检测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Fully Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (FUAD) is a practical extension of
Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (UAD), aiming to detect anomalies without any
labels even when the training set may contain anomalous samples. To achieve
FUAD, we pioneer the introduction of Knowledge Distillation (KD) paradigm based
on teacher-student framework into the FUAD setting. However, due to the
presence of anomalies in the training data, traditional KD methods risk
enabling the student to learn the teacher's representation of anomalies under
FUAD setting, thereby resulting in poor anomaly detection performance. To
address this issue, we propose a novel Cross-Domain Distillation (CDD)
framework based on the widely studied reverse distillation (RD) paradigm.
Specifically, we design a Domain-Specific Training, which divides the training
set into multiple domains with lower anomaly ratios and train a domain-specific
student for each. Cross-Domain Knowledge Aggregation is then performed, where
pseudo-normal features generated by domain-specific students collaboratively
guide a global student to learn generalized normal representations across all
samples. Experimental results on noisy versions of the MVTec AD and VisA
datasets demonstrate that our method achieves significant performance
improvements over the baseline, validating its effectiveness under FUAD
setting.

Conclusion: 持续学习为医疗影像领域的视觉异常检测提供了有效的自适应解决方案，能够应对数据分布随时间演变带来的挑战。

Abstract: Visual Anomaly Detection (VAD) seeks to identify abnormal images and
precisely localize the corresponding anomalous regions, relying solely on
normal data during training. This approach has proven essential in domains such
as manufacturing and, more recently, in the medical field, where accurate and
explainable detection is critical. Despite its importance, the impact of
evolving input data distributions over time has received limited attention,
even though such changes can significantly degrade model performance. In
particular, given the dynamic and evolving nature of medical imaging data,
Continual Learning (CL) provides a natural and effective framework to
incrementally adapt models while preserving previously acquired knowledge. This
study explores for the first time the application of VAD models in a CL
scenario for the medical field. In this work, we utilize a CL version of the
well-established PatchCore model, called PatchCoreCL, and evaluate its
performance using BMAD, a real-world medical imaging dataset with both
image-level and pixel-level annotations. Our results demonstrate that
PatchCoreCL is an effective solution, achieving performance comparable to the
task-specific models, with a forgetting value less than a 1%, highlighting the
feasibility and potential of CL for adaptive VAD in medical imaging.

Conclusion: 该研究首次将2D X光图片作为头颅表征用于预面重建，提供了一种新的生成模型框架，在法医识别中具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Craniofacial reconstruction in forensics is one of the processes to identify
victims of crime and natural disasters. Identifying an individual from their
remains plays a crucial role when all other identification methods fail.
Traditional methods for this task, such as clay-based craniofacial
reconstruction, require expert domain knowledge and are a time-consuming
process. At the same time, other probabilistic generative models like the
statistical shape model or the Basel face model fail to capture the skull and
face cross-domain attributes. Looking at these limitations, we propose a
generic framework for craniofacial reconstruction from 2D X-ray images. Here,
we used various generative models (i.e., CycleGANs, cGANs, etc) and fine-tune
the generator and discriminator parts to generate more realistic images in two
distinct domains, which are the skull and face of an individual. This is the
first time where 2D X-rays are being used as a representation of the skull by
generative models for craniofacial reconstruction. We have evaluated the
quality of generated faces using FID, IS, and SSIM scores. Finally, we have
proposed a retrieval framework where the query is the generated face image and
the gallery is the database of real faces. By experimental results, we have
found that this can be an effective tool for forensic science.

Result: 在GenEval、T2I-CompBench和提出的VisCog-Bench基准测试中分别实现了15%、5%和19%的性能提升，证明了Visual-CoG的优越性能。

Conclusion: Visual-CoG通过多阶段推理和阶段感知奖励机制有效提升了文本到图像生成的质量和准确性，特别是在处理复杂提示方面表现出色。

Abstract: Despite the promising progress of recent autoregressive models in
text-to-image (T2I) generation, their ability to handle multi-attribute and
ambiguous prompts remains limited. To address these limitations, existing works
have applied chain-of-thought (CoT) to enable stage-aware visual synthesis and
employed reinforcement learning (RL) to improve reasoning capabilities.
However, most models provide reward signals only at the end of the generation
stage. This monolithic final-only guidance makes it difficult to identify which
stages contribute positively to the final outcome and may lead to suboptimal
policies. To tackle this issue, we propose a Visual-Chain of Guidance
(Visual-CoG) paradigm consisting of three stages: semantic reasoning, process
refining, and outcome evaluation, with stage-aware rewards providing immediate
guidance throughout the image generation pipeline. We further construct a
visual cognition benchmark, VisCog-Bench, which comprises four subtasks to
evaluate the effectiveness of semantic reasoning. Comprehensive evaluations on
GenEval, T2I-CompBench, and the proposed VisCog-Bench show improvements of 15%,
5%, and 19%, respectively, demonstrating the superior performance of the
proposed Visual-CoG. We will release all the resources soon.

TL;DR: ArgusCogito是一个受百眼巨人感知策略启发的零样本思维链框架，通过跨模态协同和全方位推理，在伪装目标分割任务中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: 受百眼巨人感知策略启发的ArgusCogito框架通过跨模态协同和全方位推理，成功解决了伪装目标分割中的深度认知挑战，为复杂视觉理解任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Camouflaged Object Segmentation (COS) poses a significant challenge due to
the intrinsic high similarity between targets and backgrounds, demanding models
capable of profound holistic understanding beyond superficial cues. Prevailing
methods, often limited by shallow feature representation, inadequate reasoning
mechanisms, and weak cross-modal integration, struggle to achieve this depth of
cognition, resulting in prevalent issues like incomplete target separation and
imprecise segmentation. Inspired by the perceptual strategy of the Hundred-eyed
Giant-emphasizing holistic observation, omnidirectional focus, and intensive
scrutiny-we introduce ArgusCogito, a novel zero-shot, chain-of-thought
framework underpinned by cross-modal synergy and omnidirectional reasoning
within Vision-Language Models (VLMs). ArgusCogito orchestrates three
cognitively-inspired stages: (1) Conjecture: Constructs a strong cognitive
prior through global reasoning with cross-modal fusion (RGB, depth, semantic
maps), enabling holistic scene understanding and enhanced target-background
disambiguation. (2) Focus: Performs omnidirectional, attention-driven scanning
and focused reasoning, guided by semantic priors from Conjecture, enabling
precise target localization and region-of-interest refinement. (3) Sculpting:
Progressively sculpts high-fidelity segmentation masks by integrating
cross-modal information and iteratively generating dense positive/negative
point prompts within focused regions, emulating Argus' intensive scrutiny.
Extensive evaluations on four challenging COS benchmarks and three Medical
Image Segmentation (MIS) benchmarks demonstrate that ArgusCogito achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, validating the framework's exceptional
efficacy, superior generalization capability, and robustness.

TL;DR: SegEarth-OV是首个用于遥感图像的无标注开放词汇分割框架，通过SimFeatUp上采样器和全局偏置缓解操作，有效利用预训练视觉语言模型的丰富语义，无需任务特定后训练即可实现精确分割。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of remote sensing (RS) images is pivotal for
comprehensive Earth observation, but the demand for interpreting new object
categories, coupled with the high expense of manual annotation, poses
significant challenges. Although open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS)
offers a promising solution, existing frameworks designed for natural images
are insufficient for the unique complexities of RS data. They struggle with
vast scale variations and fine-grained details, and their adaptation often
relies on extensive, costly annotations. To address this critical gap, this
paper introduces SegEarth-OV, the first framework for annotation-free
open-vocabulary segmentation of RS images. Specifically, we propose SimFeatUp,
a universal upsampler that robustly restores high-resolution spatial details
from coarse features, correcting distorted target shapes without any
task-specific post-training. We also present a simple yet effective Global Bias
Alleviation operation to subtract the inherent global context from patch
features, significantly enhancing local semantic fidelity. These components
empower SegEarth-OV to effectively harness the rich semantics of pre-trained
VLMs, making OVSS possible in optical RS contexts. Furthermore, to extend the
framework's universality to other challenging RS modalities like SAR images,
where large-scale VLMs are unavailable and expensive to create, we introduce
AlignEarth, which is a distillation-based strategy and can efficiently transfer
semantic knowledge from an optical VLM encoder to an SAR encoder, bypassing the
need to build SAR foundation models from scratch and enabling universal OVSS
across diverse sensor types. Extensive experiments on both optical and SAR
datasets validate that SegEarth-OV can achieve dramatic improvements over the
SOTA methods, establishing a robust foundation for annotation-free and
open-world Earth observation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EventTracer是一个基于路径追踪的渲染流水线，通过低采样路径追踪和轻量级事件脉冲网络，高效模拟复杂3D场景的高保真事件序列，速度约4分钟/秒720p视频，显著提升事件数据模拟的时空分辨率和真实感


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有事件流模拟方法通常使用无噪声RGB帧，渲染成本高且时间分辨率仅100-300FPS，远低于真实事件数据。需要一种高效、物理感知的方法来生成大规模、高时间频率的事件数据

Method: 采用低采样路径追踪加速渲染，训练轻量级事件脉冲网络（配备双极性泄漏积分发放单元和双向地球移动距离损失）将去噪RGB视频转换为真实事件序列

Result: EventTracer流水线运行速度约4分钟/秒720p视频，保持路径追踪的精确时空建模优势，在两项下游任务中显示比现有模拟器更好的场景细节捕捉能力和与真实事件数据的相似性

Conclusion: EventTracer是创建大规模事件-RGB数据集的有前景工具，能以低成本缩小事件视觉的模拟-真实差距，推动机器人、自动驾驶和VR/AR等应用场景发展

Abstract: Simulating event streams from 3D scenes has become a common practice in
event-based vision research, as it meets the demand for large-scale, high
temporal frequency data without setting up expensive hardware devices or
undertaking extensive data collections. Yet existing methods in this direction
typically work with noiseless RGB frames that are costly to render, and
therefore they can only achieve a temporal resolution equivalent to 100-300
FPS, far lower than that of real-world event data. In this work, we propose
EventTracer, a path tracing-based rendering pipeline that simulates
high-fidelity event sequences from complex 3D scenes in an efficient and
physics-aware manner. Specifically, we speed up the rendering process via low
sample-per-pixel (SPP) path tracing, and train a lightweight event spiking
network to denoise the resulting RGB videos into realistic event sequences. To
capture the physical properties of event streams, the network is equipped with
a bipolar leaky integrate-and-fired (BiLIF) spiking unit and trained with a
bidirectional earth mover distance (EMD) loss. Our EventTracer pipeline runs at
a speed of about 4 minutes per second of 720p video, and it inherits the merit
of accurate spatiotemporal modeling from its path tracing backbone. We show in
two downstream tasks that EventTracer captures better scene details and
demonstrates a greater similarity to real-world event data than other event
simulators, which establishes it as a promising tool for creating large-scale
event-RGB datasets at a low cost, narrowing the sim-to-real gap in event-based
vision, and boosting various application scenarios such as robotics, autonomous
driving, and VRAR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法主要关注从已知类别中区分和拒绝未知样本，但无法进一步识别或发现未知类别，这限制了开放集分类的实用性。

Method: 使用少样本标记数据，通过学习已知类别分类器来拒绝未知样本，然后通过推断未知类别原型并基于距离将未知样本聚类到不同类别中。

Result: 在四个基准高光谱图像数据集上的实验表明，该方法在开放集少样本分类任务中表现出具有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的原型学习和聚类方法能够有效发现未知类别，为开放集少样本高光谱图像分类提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Open-set few-shot hyperspectral image (HSI) classification aims to classify
image pixels by using few labeled pixels per class, where the pixels to be
classified may be not all from the classes that have been seen. To address the
open-set HSI classification challenge, current methods focus mainly on
distinguishing the unknown class samples from the known class samples and
rejecting them to increase the accuracy of identifying known class samples.
They fails to further identify or discovery the unknow classes among the
samples. This paper proposes a prototype learning and clustering method for
discoverying unknown classes in HSIs under the few-shot environment. Using few
labeled samples, it strives to develop the ability of infering the prototypes
of unknown classes while distinguishing unknown classes from known classes.
Once the unknown class samples are rejected by the learned known class
classifier, the proposed method can further cluster the unknown class samples
into different classes according to their distance to the inferred unknown
class prototypes. Compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, extensive
experiments on four benchmark HSI datasets demonstrate that our proposed method
exhibits competitive performance in open-set few-shot HSI classification tasks.

Abstract: This paper aims to unify Score-based Generative Models (SGMs), also known as
Diffusion models, and the Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB) problem through three
reparameterization techniques: Iterative Proportional Mean-Matching (IPMM),
Iterative Proportional Terminus-Matching (IPTM), and Iterative Proportional
Flow-Matching (IPFM). These techniques significantly accelerate and stabilize
the training of SB-based models. Furthermore, the paper introduces novel
initialization strategies that use pre-trained SGMs to effectively train
SB-based models. By using SGMs as initialization, we leverage the advantages of
both SB-based models and SGMs, ensuring efficient training of SB-based models
and further improving the performance of SGMs. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the significant effectiveness and improvements of the proposed
methods. We believe this work contributes to and paves the way for future
research on generative models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文评估了各种Class Activation Maps (CAMs)方法在不同噪声干扰下的稳健性，并提出了一个量化CAM稳健性的指标，包含一致性和响应性两个关键属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然CAMs是深度学习模型可解释性的重要方法，但其对不同噪声干扰的稳健性仍然很少被深入研究。需要系统性地评估各种CAM方法在噪声环境下的表现。

Method: 研究者通过在多种模型架构和数据集上测试不同噪声干扰对CAM解释的影响，分析噪声敏感性和数据集特征对解释稳定性的影响。并提出了一个新的稳健性指标来量化CAM的两个关键属性：一致性（在不改变预测类别的干扰下保持稳定）和响应性（对预测变化的敏感度）。

Result: 研究发现不同的CAM方法在噪声敏感性上存在显著差异，显示出很大的变化性。提出的稳健性指标能够有效地捕获CAM方法的一致性和响应性特性。

Conclusion: 这项研究系统地评估了CAM方法的噪声稳健性，并提出了一个新的量化指标来评估其稳健性。这为深度学习模型可解释性方法的稳健性评估提供了重要的工具和视角。

Abstract: Class Activation Maps (CAMs) are one of the important methods for visualizing
regions used by deep learning models. Yet their robustness to different noise
remains underexplored. In this work, we evaluate and report the resilience of
various CAM methods for different noise perturbations across multiple
architectures and datasets. By analyzing the influence of different noise types
on CAM explanations, we assess the susceptibility to noise and the extent to
which dataset characteristics may impact explanation stability. The findings
highlight considerable variability in noise sensitivity for various CAMs. We
propose a robustness metric for CAMs that captures two key properties:
consistency and responsiveness. Consistency reflects the ability of CAMs to
remain stable under input perturbations that do not alter the predicted class,
while responsiveness measures the sensitivity of CAMs to changes in the
prediction caused by such perturbations. The metric is evaluated empirically
across models, different perturbations, and datasets along with complementary
statistical tests to exemplify the applicability of our proposed approach.

Method: 开发了SpotEdit基准测试，涵盖扩散模型、自回归模型和混合生成模型，包含专门的幻觉评估组件来分析模型错误识别视觉提示的问题。

Result: 发现不同生成模型之间存在显著的性能差异，领先模型如GPT-4o经常出现幻觉问题，错误地认为存在视觉提示并执行编辑任务。

Conclusion: SpotEdit基准测试揭示了当前视觉引导图像编辑方法的局限性，特别是幻觉问题，为未来模型改进提供了重要参考，代码和基准已公开。

Abstract: Visually-guided image editing, where edits are conditioned on both visual
cues and textual prompts, has emerged as a powerful paradigm for fine-grained,

remarkable capabilities, existing evaluations remain simple and insufficiently
representative of real-world editing challenges. We present SpotEdit, a
comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically assess visually-guided image
editing methods across diverse diffusion, autoregressive, and hybrid generative
models, uncovering substantial performance disparities. To address a critical
yet underexplored challenge, our benchmark includes a dedicated component on
hallucination, highlighting how leading models, such as GPT-4o, often
hallucinate the existence of a visual cue and erroneously perform the editing
task. Our code and benchmark are publicly released at

Abstract: Large annotated datasets are vital for training segmentation models, but
pixel-level labeling is time-consuming, error-prone, and often requires scarce
expert annotators, especially in medical imaging. In contrast, coarse
annotations are quicker, cheaper, and easier to produce, even by non-experts.
In this paper, we propose to use coarse drawings from both positive (target)
and negative (background) classes in the image, even with noisy pixels, to
train a convolutional neural network (CNN) for semantic segmentation. We
present a method for learning the true segmentation label distributions from
purely noisy coarse annotations using two coupled CNNs. The separation of the
two CNNs is achieved by high fidelity with the characters of the noisy training
annotations. We propose to add a complementary label learning that encourages
estimating negative label distribution. To illustrate the properties of our
method, we first use a toy segmentation dataset based on MNIST. We then present
the quantitative results of experiments using publicly available datasets:
Cityscapes dataset for multi-class segmentation, and retinal images for medical
applications. In all experiments, our method outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, particularly in the cases where the ratio of coarse annotations is
small compared to the given dense annotations.

Conclusion: 提出的BRAIN方法有效解决了脑信号不一致性带来的挑战，通过偏置缓解和知识保持技术显著提升了视觉-大脑理解模型的性能。

Abstract: Memory decay makes it harder for the human brain to recognize visual objects
and retain details. Consequently, recorded brain signals become weaker,
uncertain, and contain poor visual context over time. This paper presents one
of the first vision-learning approaches to address this problem. First, we
statistically and experimentally demonstrate the existence of inconsistency in
brain signals and its impact on the Vision-Brain Understanding (VBU) model. Our
findings show that brain signal representations shift over recording sessions,
leading to compounding bias, which poses challenges for model learning and
degrades performance. Then, we propose a new Bias-Mitigation Continual Learning
(BRAIN) approach to address these limitations. In this approach, the model is
trained in a continual learning setup and mitigates the growing bias from each
learning step. A new loss function named De-bias Contrastive Learning is also
introduced to address the bias problem. In addition, to prevent catastrophic
forgetting, where the model loses knowledge from previous sessions, the new
Angular-based Forgetting Mitigation approach is introduced to preserve learned
knowledge in the model. Finally, the empirical experiments demonstrate that our
approach achieves State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance across various
benchmarks, surpassing prior and non-continual learning methods.

Conclusion: Obz AI填补了XAI技术与实际部署之间的空白，促进了计算机视觉系统的负责任部署和透明度提升。

Abstract: Deep learning has transformed computer vision (CV), achieving outstanding
performance in classification, segmentation, and related tasks. Such AI-based
CV systems are becoming prevalent, with applications spanning from medical
imaging to surveillance. State of the art models such as convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) are often regarded as ``black
boxes,'' offering limited transparency into their decision-making processes.
Despite a recent advancement in explainable AI (XAI), explainability remains
underutilized in practical CV deployments. A primary obstacle is the absence of
integrated software solutions that connect XAI techniques with robust knowledge
management and monitoring frameworks. To close this gap, we have developed Obz
AI, a comprehensive software ecosystem designed to facilitate state-of-the-art
explainability and observability for vision AI systems. Obz AI provides a
seamless integration pipeline, from a Python client library to a full-stack

incorporate advanced XAI methodologies, extract and analyze features for
outlier detection, and continuously monitor AI models in real time. By making
the decision-making mechanisms of deep models interpretable, Obz AI promotes

Method: 使用潜在扩散模型，以修复后的物体外观为条件，采用推理时指导优化物体重建。引入优化循环设计，对速度场施加监督，同时优化手和物体的变换，利用多模态几何线索（法向深度对齐、轮廓一致性、2D关键点重投影）和符号距离场监督，强制接触和非相交约束

Result: 方法在遮挡下产生准确、鲁棒和一致的重建，在野外场景中泛化良好

Conclusion: 该扩散框架通过手-物体交互的几何指导，成功实现了高质量的单目3D物体重建，确保了物理合理性和交互一致性

Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion-based framework for reconstructing 3D geometry
of hand-held objects from monocular RGB images by leveraging hand-object
interaction as geometric guidance. Our method conditions a latent diffusion
model on an inpainted object appearance and uses inference-time guidance to
optimize the object reconstruction, while simultaneously ensuring plausible
hand-object interactions. Unlike prior methods that rely on extensive
post-processing or produce low-quality reconstructions, our approach directly
generates high-quality object geometry during the diffusion process by
introducing guidance with an optimization-in-the-loop design. Specifically, we
guide the diffusion model by applying supervision to the velocity field while
simultaneously optimizing the transformations of both the hand and the object
being reconstructed. This optimization is driven by multi-modal geometric cues,
including normal and depth alignment, silhouette consistency, and 2D keypoint
reprojection. We further incorporate signed distance field supervision and
enforce contact and non-intersection constraints to ensure physical
plausibility of hand-object interaction. Our method yields accurate, robust and
coherent reconstructions under occlusion while generalizing well to in-the-wild
scenarios.

TL;DR: GM-Skip是一个用于Transformer块跳过的灵活框架，通过度量引导的贪婪选择和反向删除机制，在保持输出质量的同时加速视觉语言模型推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于Transformer的视觉语言模型虽然性能优异，但计算成本高，难以部署在自动驾驶等延迟敏感应用中，需要高效的推理加速方案。

Method: 采用度量引导的贪婪块选择策略，利用准确率等指标反馈识别冗余层，结合反向顺序删除机制保留早期基础块，并通过得分-稀疏度平衡目标实现可调节的性能权衡。

Result: 在COCO数据集上，人物分类准确率从19.1%提升至87.3%，跳过超过40%的Transformer块；在自动驾驶系统中实现45.4%的延迟降低。

Conclusion: GM-Skip能有效加速视觉语言模型推理，在保持性能的同时显著减少计算延迟，具有实际部署价值。

Abstract: Transformer-based Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive
performance on tasks such as image captioning, object recognition, and visual
reasoning, but their high computational cost hinders deployment in
latency-sensitive applications like autonomous driving. We introduce GM-Skip, a
flexible and metric-adaptive framework for Transformer block skipping that
accelerates VLM inference while preserving output quality. GM-Skip features a
greedy, metric-guided block selection strategy that uses metric feedback (e.g.,
accuracy, CIDEr) to identify redundant layers, along with a reverse-order
deletion mechanism that preserves early foundational blocks to avoid
performance collapse. To support diverse deployment needs, it incorporates a
tunable trade-off between sparsity and performance via a score-sparsity balance
objective. Experiments across multiple tasks and datasets, including COCO and
CODA, show that GM-Skip consistently improves inference speed while maintaining
task performance. On the COCO dataset, GM-Skip improves single-object
classification accuracy on the Person category from 19.1 percent to 87.3
percent while skipping more than 40 percent of Transformer blocks. In
real-world deployment, it achieves up to 45.4 percent latency reduction on
single-object detection when integrated into an autonomous vehicle running
Autoware.Universe, validating the effectiveness of its skip configurations and
confirming its practical value in accelerating real-world inference.

TL;DR: SKD-CAG方法通过自知识蒸馏和交叉注意力引导，选择性消除文本到图像扩散模型中的后门攻击关联，在保持图像质量的同时有效防御后门攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像扩散模型容易受到后门攻击，攻击者可以通过注入不可见的文本触发器来操纵模型输出。虽然分类模型中的文本后门防御已有研究，但生成模型缺乏有效的缓解技术。

Method: 提出自知识蒸馏与交叉注意力引导（SKD-CAG）方法，利用知识蒸馏引导模型修正对中毒提示的响应，同时通过交叉注意力机制在注意力层面消除后门影响，保持图像质量。

Result: 实验表明该方法优于现有方法，像素后门移除准确率达到100%，基于风格攻击的移除准确率达到93%，且不牺牲鲁棒性或图像保真度。

Conclusion: 目标性遗忘是保护生成模型安全的有前景的防御策略，SKD-CAG方法有效解决了文本到图像扩散模型的后门安全问题。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have revolutionized generative AI, but their
vulnerability to backdoor attacks poses significant security risks. Adversaries
can inject imperceptible textual triggers into training data, causing models to
generate manipulated outputs. Although text-based backdoor defenses in
classification models are well-explored, generative models lack effective
mitigation techniques against. We address this by selectively erasing the
model's learned associations between adversarial text triggers and poisoned
outputs, while preserving overall generation quality. Our approach,
Self-Knowledge Distillation with Cross-Attention Guidance (SKD-CAG), uses
knowledge distillation to guide the model in correcting responses to poisoned
prompts while maintaining image quality by exploiting the fact that the
backdoored model still produces clean outputs in the absence of triggers. Using
the cross-attention mechanism, SKD-CAG neutralizes backdoor influences at the
attention level, ensuring the targeted removal of adversarial effects.
Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing approaches,
achieving removal accuracy 100\% for pixel backdoors and 93\% for style-based
attacks, without sacrificing robustness or image fidelity. Our findings
highlight targeted unlearning as a promising defense to secure generative
models. Code and model weights can be found at

TL;DR: LanSE是一个新的评估框架，通过识别可解释的视觉模式并用自然语言描述，为AI生成图像提供细粒度评估，包括提示匹配、视觉真实感、物理合理性和内容多样性四个维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI生成内容的评估指标过于粗糙，无法识别具体优缺点，限制了模型选择和科学理解，需要更细粒度的可解释评估方法。

Method: 提出Language-Grounded Sparse Encoders (LanSE)架构，通过大规模人工评估（超过11,000个标注）和多模态模型分析，识别可解释的视觉模式。

Result: LanSE在自然图像中检测可解释视觉模式的准确率超过93%，能够揭示现有指标无法发现的模型细微差异，如FLUX的物理合理性优势和SDXL-medium的内容多样性优势。

Conclusion: LanSE为生成式AI用户提供了强大的模型选择、合成内容质量控制和模型改进工具，直接满足公众对AI生成内容可信度和安全性的需求。

Abstract: While the quality of AI-generated contents, such as synthetic images, has
become remarkably high, current evaluation metrics provide only coarse-grained
assessments, failing to identify specific strengths and weaknesses that
researchers and practitioners need for model selection and development, further
limiting the scientific understanding and commercial deployment of these
generative models. To address this, we introduce Language-Grounded Sparse
Encoders (LanSE), a novel architecture that creates interpretable evaluation
metrics by identifying interpretable visual patterns and automatically
describing them in natural language. Through large-scale human evaluation (more
than 11,000 annotations) and large multimodal model (LMM) based analysis, LanSE
demonstrates reliable capabilities to detect interpretable visual patterns in
synthetic images with more than 93\% accuracy in natural images. LanSE further
provides a fine-grained evaluation framework that quantifies four key
dimensions of generation quality, prompt match, visual realism, physical
plausibility, and content diversity. LanSE reveals nuanced model differences
invisible to existing metrics, for instance, FLUX's superior physical
plausibility and SDXL-medium's strong content diversity, while aligning with
human judgments. By bridging interpretability with practical evaluation needs,
LanSE offers all users of generative AI models a powerful tool for model
selection, quality control of synthetic content, and model improvement. These
capabilities directly address the need for public confidence and safety in
AI-generated content, both critical for the future of generative AI
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统3D人体姿势估计模型在缺少相机参数或身体段长度优先知识时性能下降的问题，并提高模型在嵌入式平台上的部署能力。

Method: 使用Transformer结构，给模型提供几何优先知识（段长度和相机参数），通过掩码机制处理缺失的优先信息，训练于AMASS数据集生成的合成2D数据。

Result: 模型在各种情况下都表现优异，平均3D关节位置误差仅36mm，运行速度快（GPU 380μs，CPU 1800μs），性能超过专业模型。

Conclusion: 该轻量级Transformer模型为单目摄像头3D人体姿势估计提供了高效解决方案，适用于从实验室到野外的各种部署场景。

Abstract: This paper proposes a new lightweight Transformer-based lifter that maps
short sequences of human 2D joint positions to 3D poses using a single camera.
The proposed model takes as input geometric priors including segment lengths
and camera intrinsics and is designed to operate in both calibrated and
uncalibrated settings. To this end, a masking mechanism enables the model to
ignore missing priors during training and inference. This yields a single
versatile network that can adapt to different deployment scenarios, from fully
calibrated lab environments to in-the-wild monocular videos without
calibration. The model was trained using 3D keypoints from AMASS dataset with
corresponding 2D synthetic data generated by sampling random camera poses and
intrinsics. It was then compared to an expert model trained, only on complete
priors, and the validation was done by conducting an ablation study. Results
show that both, camera and segment length priors, improve performance and that
the versatile model outperforms the expert, even when all priors are available,
and maintains high accuracy when priors are missing. Overall the average 3D
joint center positions estimation accuracy was as low as 36mm improving state
of the art by half a centimeter and at a much lower computational cost. Indeed,
the proposed model runs in 380$\mu$s on GPU and 1800$\mu$s on CPU, making it
suitable for deployment on embedded platforms and low-power devices.

Motivation: 针对3D高斯泼溅场景表示的视觉定位需求，开发一种能够直接利用现有3DGS模型进行相机定位的方法，避免对模型进行修改或重新训练。

Method: 通过下采样和编码3D高斯生成场景特征，编码图像块获取图像特征，采用三步骤流程：粗匹配、精匹配和姿态细化，实现稳健的特征匹配和精确的位姿估计。

Result: 在室内外场景的标准基准测试中表现出有竞争力的定位性能，优于现有的3DGS基线方法，且能够有效泛化到新场景而无需额外训练。

Conclusion: GSVisLoc成功证明了直接利用3DGS场景表示进行视觉定位的可行性，为基于神经渲染的场景表示提供了实用的定位解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce GSVisLoc, a visual localization method designed for 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) scene representations. Given a 3DGS model of a scene and a
query image, our goal is to estimate the camera's position and orientation. We
accomplish this by robustly matching scene features to image features. Scene
features are produced by downsampling and encoding the 3D Gaussians while image
features are obtained by encoding image patches. Our algorithm proceeds in
three steps, starting with coarse matching, then fine matching, and finally by
applying pose refinement for an accurate final estimate. Importantly, our
method leverages the explicit 3DGS scene representation for visual localization
without requiring modifications, retraining, or additional reference images. We
evaluate GSVisLoc on both indoor and outdoor scenes, demonstrating competitive
localization performance on standard benchmarks while outperforming existing
3DGS-based baselines. Moreover, our approach generalizes effectively to novel
scenes without additional training.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MMTok方法，利用视觉和文本token的多模态信息，通过最大覆盖准则选择信息丰富的视觉token，显著提高视觉语言模型的推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在视觉token处理中存在冗余问题，大多数剪枝方法仅使用单模态信息，忽略了视觉语言任务的多模态特性，且缺乏通用的选择标准。

Method: 将子集选择问题建模为最大覆盖问题，优化视觉token子集同时覆盖文本token和原始视觉token集，并使用VLM代理提升文本token质量来指导视觉剪枝。

Result: 在POPE数据集上实现1.87倍加速，保持LLaVA-NeXT-13B模型98.7%的原始性能；仅用4个视觉token仍能保持LLaVA-1.5-7B模型87.7%的原始性能。

Conclusion: 视觉和文本信息具有互补性，多模态信息结合能显著超越单模态基线，覆盖准则在token选择中非常有效。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive performance in
understanding visual content with language instruction by converting visual
input to vision tokens. However, redundancy in vision tokens results in the
degenerated inference efficiency of VLMs. While many algorithms have been
proposed to reduce the number of vision tokens, most of them apply only
unimodal information (i.e., vision/text) for pruning and ignore the inherent
multimodal property of vision-language tasks. Moreover, it lacks a generic
criterion that can be applied to different modalities. To mitigate this
limitation, in this work, we propose to leverage both vision and text tokens to
select informative vision tokens by the criterion of coverage. We first
formulate the subset selection problem as a maximum coverage problem.
Afterward, a subset of vision tokens is optimized to cover the text tokens and
the original set of vision tokens, simultaneously. Finally, a VLM agent can be
adopted to further improve the quality of text tokens for guiding vision
pruning. The proposed method MMTok is extensively evaluated on benchmark
datasets with different VLMs. The comparison illustrates that vision and text
information are complementary, and combining multimodal information can surpass
the unimodal baseline with a clear margin. Moreover, under the maximum coverage
criterion on the POPE dataset, our method achieves a 1.87x speedup while
maintaining 98.7% of the original performance on LLaVA-NeXT-13B. Furthermore,
with only four vision tokens, it still preserves 87.7% of the original
performance on LLaVA-1.5-7B. These results highlight the effectiveness of
coverage in token selection.

Abstract: We introduce InternVL 3.5, a new family of open-source multimodal models that
significantly advances versatility, reasoning capability, and inference
efficiency along the InternVL series. A key innovation is the Cascade
Reinforcement Learning (Cascade RL) framework, which enhances reasoning through
a two-stage process: offline RL for stable convergence and online RL for
refined alignment. This coarse-to-fine training strategy leads to substantial
improvements on downstream reasoning tasks, e.g., MMMU and MathVista. To
optimize efficiency, we propose a Visual Resolution Router (ViR) that
dynamically adjusts the resolution of visual tokens without compromising
performance. Coupled with ViR, our Decoupled Vision-Language Deployment (DvD)
strategy separates the vision encoder and language model across different GPUs,
effectively balancing computational load. These contributions collectively
enable InternVL3.5 to achieve up to a +16.0\% gain in overall reasoning
performance and a 4.05$\times$ inference speedup compared to its predecessor,
i.e., InternVL3. In addition, InternVL3.5 supports novel capabilities such as
GUI interaction and embodied agency. Notably, our largest model, i.e.,
InternVL3.5-241B-A28B, attains state-of-the-art results among open-source MLLMs
across general multimodal, reasoning, text, and agentic tasks -- narrowing the
performance gap with leading commercial models like GPT-5. All models and code

Conclusion: 该方法通过利用视频编辑模型解决了多视角修复不一致的问题，为高质量3D物体补全和编辑提供了有效的解决方案，具有实际部署价值。

Abstract: 3D inpainting often relies on multi-view 2D image inpainting, where the
inherent inconsistencies across different inpainted views can result in blurred
textures, spatial discontinuities, and distracting visual artifacts. These
inconsistencies pose significant challenges when striving for accurate and
realistic 3D object completion, particularly in applications that demand high
fidelity and structural coherence. To overcome these limitations, we propose
ObjFiller-3D, a novel method designed for the completion and editing of
high-quality and consistent 3D objects. Instead of employing a conventional 2D
image inpainting model, our approach leverages a curated selection of
state-of-the-art video editing model to fill in the masked regions of 3D
objects. We analyze the representation gap between 3D and videos, and propose
an adaptation of a video inpainting model for 3D scene inpainting. In addition,
we introduce a reference-based 3D inpainting method to further enhance the
quality of reconstruction. Experiments across diverse datasets show that
compared to previous methods, ObjFiller-3D produces more faithful and
fine-grained reconstructions (PSNR of 26.6 vs. NeRFiller (15.9) and LPIPS of
0.19 vs. Instant3dit (0.25)). Moreover, it demonstrates strong potential for
practical deployment in real-world 3D editing applications. Project page:

TL;DR: 深度学习模型能够仅使用非对比MRI序列（T1、T2、T2/FLAIR）准确预测脑肿瘤对比增强，性能优于放射科专家，可能减少钆对比剂的使用需求。


<details>

Motivation: 钆对比剂在脑肿瘤成像中并非总是可行（如频繁随访、肾功能不全、过敏或儿科患者），需要开发替代方案来减少对对比剂的依赖。

Method: 使用来自10个国际数据集的11089个脑MRI研究，训练nnU-Net、SegResNet和SwinUNETR等深度学习模型，仅使用非对比T1、T2和T2/FLAIR加权图像来预测和分割增强肿瘤。

Conclusion: 深度学习可以从非对比MRI中识别对比增强脑肿瘤，具有临床相关性能，有望作为筛查工具并减少神经肿瘤成像中对钆的依赖。

Abstract: Brain tumour imaging assessment typically requires both pre- and
post-contrast MRI, but gadolinium administration is not always desirable, such
as in frequent follow-up, renal impairment, allergy, or paediatric patients. We
aimed to develop and validate a deep learning model capable of predicting brain
tumour contrast enhancement from non-contrast MRI sequences alone. We assembled
11089 brain MRI studies from 10 international datasets spanning adult and
paediatric populations with various neuro-oncological states, including glioma,
meningioma, metastases, and post-resection appearances. Deep learning models
(nnU-Net, SegResNet, SwinUNETR) were trained to predict and segment enhancing
tumour using only non-contrast T1-, T2-, and T2/FLAIR-weighted images.
Performance was evaluated on 1109 held-out test patients using patient-level
detection metrics and voxel-level segmentation accuracy. Model predictions were
compared against 11 expert radiologists who each reviewed 100 randomly selected
patients. The best-performing nnU-Net achieved 83% balanced accuracy, 91.5%
sensitivity, and 74.4% specificity in detecting enhancing tumour. Enhancement
volume predictions strongly correlated with ground truth (R2 0.859). The model
outperformed expert radiologists, who achieved 69.8% accuracy, 75.9%
sensitivity, and 64.7% specificity. 76.8% of test patients had Dice over 0.3
(acceptable detection), 67.5% had Dice over 0.5 (good detection), and 50.2% had
Dice over 0.7 (excellent detection). Deep learning can identify
contrast-enhancing brain tumours from non-contrast MRI with clinically relevant
performance. These models show promise as screening tools and may reduce
gadolinium dependence in neuro-oncology imaging. Future work should evaluate
clinical utility alongside radiology experts.

Motivation: 在手术视频分析中，专家标注成本高昂，如何选择最适合的预训练模型进行下游任务微调是一个关键挑战，需要不依赖完整重训练的迁移性评估方法。

Method: 在两个多样化数据集(RAMIE和AutoLaparo)上，对三种代表性迁移性估计指标(LogME、H-Score、TransRate)进行了全面基准测试，并通过消融研究分析模型性能相似时的判别能力。

Result: LogME(特别是按子集最小得分聚合时)与微调精度最接近；H-Score预测能力较弱；TransRate经常反转真实的模型排名。当候选模型性能相似时，迁移性估计失去判别能力。

Conclusion: 提出了模型选择的实用指南，并指出未来需要发展领域特定指标、理论基础和交互式基准测试工具。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained models has become a cornerstone of modern machine
learning, allowing practitioners to achieve high performance with limited
labeled data. In surgical video analysis, where expert annotations are
especially time-consuming and costly, identifying the most suitable pre-trained
model for a downstream task is both critical and challenging.
Source-independent transferability estimation (SITE) offers a solution by
predicting how well a model will fine-tune on target data using only its
embeddings or outputs, without requiring full retraining. In this work, we
formalize SITE for surgical phase recognition and provide the first
comprehensive benchmark of three representative metrics, LogME, H-Score, and
TransRate, on two diverse datasets (RAMIE and AutoLaparo). Our results show
that LogME, particularly when aggregated by the minimum per-subset score,
aligns most closely with fine-tuning accuracy; H-Score yields only weak
predictive power; and TransRate often inverses true model rankings. Ablation
studies show that when candidate models have similar performances,
transferability estimates lose discriminative power, emphasizing the importance
of maintaining model diversity or using additional validation. We conclude with
practical guidelines for model selection and outline future directions toward
domain-specific metrics, theoretical foundations, and interactive benchmarking
tools.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of laryngo-pharyngeal tumors is crucial for precise
diagnosis and effective treatment planning. However, traditional
single-modality imaging methods often fall short of capturing the complex
anatomical and pathological features of these tumors. In this study, we present
an innovative multi-modality representation learning framework based on the
`Align-Disentangle-Fusion' mechanism that seamlessly integrates 2D White Light
Imaging (WLI) and Narrow Band Imaging (NBI) pairs to enhance segmentation
performance. A cornerstone of our approach is multi-scale distribution
alignment, which mitigates modality discrepancies by aligning features across
multiple transformer layers. Furthermore, a progressive feature disentanglement
strategy is developed with the designed preliminary disentanglement and
disentangle-aware contrastive learning to effectively separate
modality-specific and shared features, enabling robust multimodal contrastive
learning and efficient semantic fusion. Comprehensive experiments on multiple
datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving superior accuracy across diverse real clinical scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出首个基于桥扩散模型的解决方案，从非对比CT扫描生成合成对比增强CTA图像，无需使用造影剂即可获得高质量血管影像


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对比剂在CT成像中存在肾毒性和过敏反应风险，开发无需对比剂即可生成高质量CTA图像的技术可提高患者安全性、可及性并降低医疗成本

Method: 基于Slice-Consistent Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model (SC-BBDM)，在保持切片间一致性的同时建模复杂映射，采用包括重采样、对称归一化配准和扩张分割掩模的综合预处理流程

Result: 在两个数据集（仅主动脉和主动脉+心脏）上验证方法有效性，证明在保持血管结构完整性的同时提升对比度保真度

Conclusion: 该桥扩散模型框架能够在低内存预算下保持3D解剖完整性，为无对比剂CTA成像提供了一种有前景的解决方案

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) imaging is essential for
diagnosing and monitoring thoracic diseases, including aortic pathologies.
However, contrast agents pose risks such as nephrotoxicity and allergic-like
reactions. The ability to generate high-fidelity synthetic contrast-enhanced CT
angiography (CTA) images without contrast administration would be
transformative, enhancing patient safety and accessibility while reducing
healthcare costs. In this study, we propose the first bridge diffusion-based
solution for synthesizing contrast-enhanced CTA images from non-contrast CT
scans. Our approach builds on the Slice-Consistent Brownian Bridge Diffusion
Model (SC-BBDM), leveraging its ability to model complex mappings while
maintaining consistency across slices. Unlike conventional slice-wise synthesis
methods, our framework preserves full 3D anatomical integrity while operating
in a high-resolution 2D fashion, allowing seamless volumetric interpretation
under a low memory budget. To ensure robust spatial alignment, we implement a
comprehensive preprocessing pipeline that includes resampling, registration
using the Symmetric Normalization method, and a sophisticated dilated
segmentation mask to extract the aorta and surrounding structures. We create
two datasets from the Coltea-Lung dataset: one containing only the aorta and
another including both the aorta and heart, enabling a detailed analysis of
anatomical context. We compare our approach against baseline methods on both
datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in preserving vascular structures
while enhancing contrast fidelity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像容易受噪声影响，降低诊断准确性。需要研究最佳的深度学习去噪方法来提高图像质量和临床评估准确性。

Method: 使用Figshare MRI脑部数据集，系统测试三种深度学习架构（CNN-DAE、CADTra、DCMIEDNet）在不同高斯噪声强度（σ=10,15,25）下的去噪性能，并与传统小波方法进行对比。

Result: DCMIEDNet在低噪声水平（σ=10和15）下表现最佳，PSNR分别达到32.921±2.350dB咄30.943±2.339dB。CADTra在高噪声水平（σ=25）下更稳健，PSNR为27.671±2.091dB。所有深度学习方法都显著超过传统方法5-8dB。

Abstract: Medical imaging modalities are inherently susceptible to noise contamination
that degrades diagnostic utility and clinical assessment accuracy. This paper
presents a comprehensive comparative evaluation of three state-of-the-art deep
learning architectures for MRI brain image denoising: CNN-DAE, CADTra, and
DCMIEDNet. We systematically evaluate these models across multiple Gaussian
noise intensities ($\sigma = 10, 15, 25$) using the Figshare MRI Brain Dataset.
Our experimental results demonstrate that DCMIEDNet achieves superior
performance at lower noise levels, with PSNR values of $32.921 \pm 2.350$ dB
and $30.943 \pm 2.339$ dB for $\sigma = 10$ and $15$ respectively. However,
CADTra exhibits greater robustness under severe noise conditions ($\sigma =
25$), achieving the highest PSNR of $27.671 \pm 2.091$ dB. All deep learning
approaches significantly outperform traditional wavelet-based methods, with
improvements ranging from 5-8 dB across tested conditions. This study
establishes quantitative benchmarks for medical image denoising and provides
insights into architecture-specific strengths for varying noise intensities.

Abstract: Echocardiography plays a central role in cardiac imaging, offering dynamic
views of the heart that are essential for diagnosis and monitoring. However,
image quality can be significantly degraded by haze arising from multipath
reverberations, particularly in difficult-to-image patients. In this work, we
propose a semantic-guided, diffusion-based dehazing algorithm developed for the
MICCAI Dehazing Echocardiography Challenge (DehazingEcho2025). Our method
integrates a pixel-wise noise model, derived from semantic segmentation of hazy
inputs into a diffusion posterior sampling framework guided by a generative
prior trained on clean ultrasound data. Quantitative evaluation on the
challenge dataset demonstrates strong performance across contrast and fidelity
metrics. Code for the submitted algorithm is available at

TL;DR: 提出了PEFRF框架，融合排列熵特征和随机森林，用于跨内容图像质量评估，在13个数据集上超越40+现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像质量评估方法在自然场景图像和屏幕内容图像之间泛化能力不足，需要统一的跨内容评估解决方案

Method: 从参考图像、失真图像和融合图像的梯度图中提取排列熵特征，形成特征向量，然后使用随机森林回归器基于主观质量评分进行训练和预测

Result: 在包含21,000+图像的13个基准数据集上测试，PEFRF在各种失真类型和内容领域均优于40+最先进的IQA指标

Conclusion: PEFRF是一个统一且统计显著的跨内容图像质量评估解决方案，能够有效处理不同图像类型的结构复杂性差异

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) plays a vital role in applications such as
image compression, restoration, and multimedia streaming. However, existing
metrics often struggle to generalize across diverse image types - particularly
between natural-scene images (NSIs) and screen-content images (SCIs) - due to
their differing structural and perceptual characteristics. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel full-reference IQA framework: Permutation
Entropy-based Features Fused with Random Forest (PEFRF). PEFRF captures
structural complexity by extracting permutation entropy from the gradient maps
of reference, distorted, and fused images, forming a robust feature vector.
These features are then input into a Random Forest regressor trained on
subjective quality scores to predict final image quality. The framework is
evaluated on 13 benchmark datasets comprising over 21,000 images and 40+
state-of-the-art IQA metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that PEFRF
consistently outperforms existing methods across various distortion types and
content domains, establishing its effectiveness as a unified and statistically
significant solution for cross-content image quality assessment.

Motivation: 流式传输360度虚拟现实视频需要大量带宽，通常通过将视频分成瓦片并基于用户视线选择性分发来优化传输。这种交互方式使得评估质量和用户体验变得困难。

Method: 开发py360tools Python库，自动化客户端任务如视频重建、瓦片选择和视口提取，支持360度视频流媒体会话的复现、模拟和分析。

Conclusion: py360tools库有效解决了360度视频流媒体中客户端任务自动化的需求，为相关研究提供了便利的工具支持。

Abstract: Streaming 360$^\circ$ videos for virtual reality demands a lot of bandwidth.
To optimize this transmission, videos are divided into "tiles" and selectively
distributed to the user based on what they are looking at. This interactive
approach makes it difficult to assess quality and user experience. To solve
this, the paper presents py360tools, a Python library that automates
client-side tasks like video reconstruction, tile selection, and viewport
extraction. This facilitates the reproduction, simulation, and analysis of
360$^\circ$ video streaming sessions.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的Residual Encoder U-Net用于乳腺超声图像分割，重点关注不确定性量化。通过识别和纠正BUSI数据集中的数据重复问题，使用去重子集进行更可靠的泛化性能评估。


<details>

Motivation: 乳腺超声图像自动分割对于精确病变描绘和肿瘤表征至关重要，但受到固有伪影和数据集不一致性的挑战。需要可靠的不确定性量化来提升临床部署的可信度。

Method: 使用改进的Residual Encoder U-Net架构，采用蒙特卡洛dropout、深度集成及其组合来量化认知不确定性。在去重的BUSI数据集子集上训练，并在分布内和分布外数据集上进行基准测试。

Conclusion: 研究突出了医学影像中域偏移的持续挑战，以及集成不确定性建模对于可信临床部署的重要性。不确定性估计能够有效识别模型在未知数据上的不可靠预测。

Abstract: Automated segmentation of BUS images is important for precise lesion
delineation and tumor characterization, but is challenged by inherent artifacts
and dataset inconsistencies. In this work, we evaluate the use of a modified
Residual Encoder U-Net for breast ultrasound segmentation, with a focus on
uncertainty quantification. We identify and correct for data duplication in the
BUSI dataset, and use a deduplicated subset for more reliable estimates of
generalization performance. Epistemic uncertainty is quantified using Monte
Carlo dropout, deep ensembles, and their combination. Models are benchmarked on
both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets to demonstrate how they
generalize to unseen cross-domain data. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art
segmentation accuracy on the Breast-Lesion-USG dataset with in-distribution
validation, and provides calibrated uncertainty estimates that effectively
signal regions of low model confidence. Performance declines and increased
uncertainty observed in out-of-distribution evaluation highlight the persistent
challenge of domain shift in medical imaging, and the importance of integrated
uncertainty modeling for trustworthy clinical deployment. \footnote{Code

Result: 在各种信道压缩水平下显著优于基准方法，同时保持低计算复杂度和存储开销

Conclusion: 该系统在自动驾驶和夜间监控等应用中具有巨大潜力

Abstract: Multimodal semantic communication has gained widespread attention due to its
ability to enhance downstream task performance. A key challenge in such systems
is the effective fusion of features from different modalities, which requires
the extraction of rich and diverse semantic representations from each modality.
To this end, we propose ProMSC-MIS, a Prompt-based Multimodal Semantic
Communication system for Multi-spectral Image Segmentation. Specifically, we
propose a pre-training algorithm where features from one modality serve as
prompts for another, guiding unimodal semantic encoders to learn diverse and
complementary semantic representations. We further introduce a semantic fusion
module that combines cross-attention mechanisms and squeeze-and-excitation (SE)
networks to effectively fuse cross-modal features. Simulation results show that
ProMSC-MIS significantly outperforms benchmark methods across various
channel-source compression levels, while maintaining low computational
complexity and storage overhead. Our scheme has great potential for
applications such as autonomous driving and nighttime surveillance.

Method: 建立包含10,185张高清图像的FGLive-10K数据集，开发TuningIQA方法，集成人类感知特征提取和基于图的相机参数融合

Result: TuningIQA在分数回归和细粒度质量排序方面显著优于最先进的BIQA方法，在直播相机调优中表现出优异性能

Conclusion: 该研究填补了细粒度BIQA在直播相机调优中的空白，为自动相机质量调优提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Livestreaming has become increasingly prevalent in modern visual
communication, where automatic camera quality tuning is essential for
delivering superior user Quality of Experience (QoE). Such tuning requires
accurate blind image quality assessment (BIQA) to guide parameter optimization
decisions. Unfortunately, the existing BIQA models typically only predict an
overall coarse-grained quality score, which cannot provide fine-grained
perceptual guidance for precise camera parameter tuning. To bridge this gap, we
first establish FGLive-10K, a comprehensive fine-grained BIQA database
containing 10,185 high-resolution images captured under varying camera
parameter configurations across diverse livestreaming scenarios. The dataset
features 50,925 multi-attribute quality annotations and 19,234 fine-grained
pairwise preference annotations. Based on FGLive-10K, we further develop
TuningIQA, a fine-grained BIQA metric for livestreaming camera tuning, which
integrates human-aware feature extraction and graph-based camera parameter
fusion. Extensive experiments and comparisons demonstrate that TuningIQA
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art BIQA methods in both score
regression and fine-grained quality ranking, achieving superior performance
when deployed for livestreaming camera tuning.

Abstract: Accurate 3D geometry acquisition is essential for a wide range of
applications, such as computer graphics, autonomous driving, robotics, and
augmented reality. However, raw point clouds acquired in real-world
environments are often corrupted with noise due to various factors such as
sensor, lighting, material, environment etc, which reduces geometric fidelity
and degrades downstream performance. Point cloud denoising is a fundamental
problem, aiming to recover clean point sets while preserving underlying
structures. Classical optimization-based methods, guided by hand-crafted
filters or geometric priors, have been extensively studied but struggle to
handle diverse and complex noise patterns. Recent deep learning approaches
leverage neural network architectures to learn distinctive representations and
demonstrate strong outcomes, particularly on complex and large-scale point
clouds. Provided these significant advances, this survey provides a
comprehensive and up-to-date review of deep learning-based point cloud
denoising methods up to August 2025. We organize the literature from two
perspectives: (1) supervision level (supervised vs. unsupervised), and (2)
modeling perspective, proposing a functional taxonomy that unifies diverse
approaches by their denoising principles. We further analyze architectural
trends both structurally and chronologically, establish a unified benchmark
with consistent training settings, and evaluate methods in terms of denoising
quality, surface fidelity, point distribution, and computational efficiency.
Finally, we discuss open challenges and outline directions for future research
in this rapidly evolving field.

Motivation: 现有舞蹈生成方法只支持直接合成，无法满足实际编舞场景中用户编辑舞蹈动作的需求，且缺乏高质量的可编辑舞蹈数据集

Method: 采用预测-编辑范式，首先从音乐直接建模舞蹈动作生成初始结果，然后通过跨模态编辑模块(CEM)整合音乐和文本提示进行迭代编辑

Result: 在新建的DanceRemix数据集上超越了现有最先进模型，能够生成既符合音乐节奏又与文本描述语义对齐的舞蹈序列

Conclusion: DanceEditor框架成功实现了音乐驱动的可迭代编辑舞蹈生成，为实际编舞应用提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Generating coherent and diverse human dances from music signals has gained
tremendous progress in animating virtual avatars. While existing methods
support direct dance synthesis, they fail to recognize that enabling users to
edit dance movements is far more practical in real-world choreography
scenarios. Moreover, the lack of high-quality dance datasets incorporating
iterative editing also limits addressing this challenge. To achieve this goal,
we first construct DanceRemix, a large-scale multi-turn editable dance dataset
comprising the prompt featuring over 25.3M dance frames and 84.5K pairs. In
addition, we propose a novel framework for iterative and editable dance
generation coherently aligned with given music signals, namely DanceEditor.
Considering the dance motion should be both musical rhythmic and enable
iterative editing by user descriptions, our framework is built upon a
prediction-then-editing paradigm unifying multi-modal conditions. At the
initial prediction stage, our framework improves the authority of generated
results by directly modeling dance movements from tailored, aligned music.
Moreover, at the subsequent iterative editing stages, we incorporate text
descriptions as conditioning information to draw the editable results through a
specifically designed Cross-modality Editing Module (CEM). Specifically, CEM
adaptively integrates the initial prediction with music and text prompts as
temporal motion cues to guide the synthesized sequences. Thereby, the results
display music harmonics while preserving fine-grained semantic alignment with
text descriptions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
outperforms the state-of-the-art models on our newly collected DanceRemix
dataset. Code is available at https://lzvsdy.github.io/DanceEditor/.

Abstract: Holographic near-eye displays offer ultra-compact form factors for virtual
and augmented reality systems, but rely on advanced computer-generated
holography (CGH) algorithms to convert 3D scenes into interference patterns
that can be displayed on spatial light modulators (SLMs). Gaussian Wave
Splatting (GWS) has recently emerged as a powerful CGH paradigm that allows for
the conversion of Gaussians, a state-of-the-art neural 3D representation, into
holograms. However, GWS assumes smooth-phase distributions over the Gaussian
primitives, limiting their ability to model view-dependent effects and
reconstruct accurate defocus blur, and severely under-utilizing the
space-bandwidth product of the SLM. In this work, we propose random-phase GWS
(GWS-RP) to improve bandwidth utilization, which has the effect of increasing
eyebox size, reconstructing accurate defocus blur and parallax, and supporting
time-multiplexed rendering to suppress speckle artifacts.
  At the core of GWS-RP are (1) a fundamentally new wavefront compositing
procedure and (2) an alpha-blending scheme specifically designed for
random-phase Gaussian primitives, ensuring physically correct color
reconstruction and robust occlusion handling. Additionally, we present the
first formally derived algorithm for applying random phase to Gaussian
primitives, grounded in rigorous statistical optics analysis and validated
through practical near-eye display applications. Through extensive simulations
and experimental validations, we demonstrate that these advancements,
collectively with time-multiplexing, uniquely enables full-bandwith light field
CGH that supports accurate accurate parallax and defocus, yielding
state-of-the-art image quality and perceptually faithful 3D holograms for
next-generation near-eye displays.

Abstract: Reference-based sketch colorization methods have garnered significant
attention for the potential application in animation and digital illustration
production. However, most existing methods are trained with image triplets of
sketch, reference, and ground truth that are semantically and spatially
similar, while real-world references and sketches often exhibit substantial
misalignment. This mismatch in data distribution between training and inference
leads to overfitting, consequently resulting in artifacts and signif- icant
quality degradation in colorization results. To address this issue, we conduct
an in-depth analysis of the reference representations, defined as the
intermedium to transfer information from reference to sketch. Building on this
analysis, we introduce a novel framework that leverages distinct reference
representations to optimize different aspects of the colorization process. Our
approach decomposes colorization into modular stages, al- lowing
region-specific reference injection to enhance visual quality and reference
similarity while mitigating spatial artifacts. Specifically, we first train a
backbone network guided by high-level semantic embeddings. We then introduce a
background encoder and a style encoder, trained in separate stages, to enhance
low-level feature transfer and improve reference similar- ity. This design also
enables flexible inference modes suited for a variety of use cases. Extensive
qualitative and quantitative evaluations, together with a user study,
demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method compared to
existing approaches. Code and pre-trained weight will be made publicly

*Xiaoyang Huang,Bingbing Ni,Wenjun Zhang*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种将AI生成的3D内容与参数化设计工具连接的方法，通过可微分建模操作和分层图优化，生成与设计师工作流程兼容的设计操作序列。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI生成内容与人类设计范式之间的表示不兼容问题，传统AI框架主要处理网格或神经表示，而设计师使用参数化建模工具，这种脱节降低了AI在3D行业中的实用价值。

Method: 将基本建模操作（如挤出、布尔运算）重新表述为可微分单元，通过基于梯度的学习联合优化连续和离散参数；构建具有门控机制的分层图，通过最小化到目标几何的Chamfer距离进行端到端优化；使用多阶段序列长度约束和领域规则惩罚实现无监督学习。

Conclusion: 该方法成功弥合了AI生成内容与人类设计工作流程之间的鸿沟，为3D行业中的人机协作提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The emergence of 3D artificial intelligence-generated content (3D-AIGC) has
enabled rapid synthesis of intricate geometries. However, a fundamental
disconnect persists between AI-generated content and human-centric design
paradigms, rooted in representational incompatibilities: conventional AI
frameworks predominantly manipulate meshes or neural representations
(\emph{e.g.}, NeRF, Gaussian Splatting), while designers operate within
parametric modeling tools. This disconnection diminishes the practical value of
AI for 3D industry, undermining the efficiency of human-AI collaboration. To
resolve this disparity, we focus on generating design operation sequences,
which are structured modeling histories that comprehensively capture the
step-by-step construction process of 3D assets and align with designers'
typical workflows in modern 3D software. We first reformulate fundamental
modeling operations (\emph{e.g.}, \emph{Extrude}, \emph{Boolean}) into
differentiable units, enabling joint optimization of continuous (\emph{e.g.},
\emph{Extrude} height) and discrete (\emph{e.g.}, \emph{Boolean} type)
parameters via gradient-based learning. Based on these differentiable
operations, a hierarchical graph with gating mechanism is constructed and
optimized end-to-end by minimizing Chamfer Distance to target geometries.
Multi-stage sequence length constraint and domain rule penalties enable
unsupervised learning of compact design sequences without ground-truth sequence
supervision. Extensive validation demonstrates that the generated operation
sequences achieve high geometric fidelity, smooth mesh wiring, rational step
composition and flexible editing capacity, with full compatibility within
design industry.

Conclusion: MeshSplat通过创新的2D高斯溅射桥接方法，成功解决了稀疏视图下的表面重建问题，为计算机视觉和图形学领域提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Surface reconstruction has been widely studied in computer vision and
graphics. However, existing surface reconstruction works struggle to recover
accurate scene geometry when the input views are extremely sparse. To address
this issue, we propose MeshSplat, a generalizable sparse-view surface
reconstruction framework via Gaussian Splatting. Our key idea is to leverage
2DGS as a bridge, which connects novel view synthesis to learned geometric
priors and then transfers these priors to achieve surface reconstruction.
Specifically, we incorporate a feed-forward network to predict per-view
pixel-aligned 2DGS, which enables the network to synthesize novel view images
and thus eliminates the need for direct 3D ground-truth supervision. To improve
the accuracy of 2DGS position and orientation prediction, we propose a Weighted
Chamfer Distance Loss to regularize the depth maps, especially in overlapping
areas of input views, and also a normal prediction network to align the
orientation of 2DGS with normal vectors predicted by a monocular normal
estimator. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed
improvement, demonstrating that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance in generalizable sparse-view mesh reconstruction tasks. Project

### [215] [Estimating volumetric water content from electrical resistivity using a random forest model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16593)
*Constantin Schorling*

Main category: physics.geo-ph

TL;DR: 使用随机森林模型从电阻率层析成像(ERT)预测体积含水量(VWC)，通过引入降水和温度参数提高了预测精度，但模型在不同位置的泛化能力有限


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确估计体积含水量(VWC)对滑坡风险预测至关重要，传统传感器测量方法局限性大，ERT提供了一种经济有效的替代方案，但需要解决ERT与VWC之间的关联挑战

Method: 开发随机森林模型，使用370-500个ERT传感器测量数据(深度10-190cm)，引入降水和气温参数并考虑深度相关的时间延迟来模拟渗透过程，在不同位置进行验证

Result: 引入降温和温度参数使MAE降低7.3%-73.0%，深度相关延迟使最大相对误差降低14.7-56.0%，平均相对误差低于2.8%。24小时预测MRE低于5%，但模型在位置间泛化能力差

Conclusion: ERT可以可靠预测VWC，但在不同位置的验证显示显著差异，预期通过在不同位置自动训练ERT模型可以消除这些差异

Abstract: Background: Accurately estimating volumetric water content (VWC) can greatly
enhance the prediction of landslide risk. The standard approach involves using
locally limited, invasive sensor measurements. Recently, however, electrical
resistivity tomography (ERT) has emerged as a cost-effective, minimally
invasive, real-time, indirect method of monitoring VWC. However, linking ER to
VWC poses distinct challenges. Purpose: Random forest models were developed to
estimate and predict VWC from ER. Spatially and temporally heterogeneous
measurements were conducted to improve robustness and accuracy. Methods: The
models were trained using 370-500 ER sensor measurements at depths of 10, 50,
150 and 190 cm. Precipitation and air temperature with a depth-dependent impact
delay were introduced to simulate infiltration. The models were then validated
at various locations, and their predictive capabilities were examined. Results:
Including precipitation and temperature as parameters reduced the mean absolute
error (MAE) by between 7.3% and 73.0%, depending on the depth. However, not all
outliers could be eliminated. Delaying the model parameter depth-dependently
reduced the maximum relative error (MaRE) by 14.7-56.0% and the mean relative
error (MRE) to below 2.8%. Observed uncertainties for the top meter remained
fairly constant. A 24 h forecast revealed an MRE below 5% for all depths;
however, outliers occurred more frequently. Nevertheless, models trained on
data from one location failed to generalize to other locations. VWC tomography
based on ERT revealed significant moisture bands at depths of one to two
meters. Conclusion: VWC can be reliably predicted from ERT. However, validation
of VWC from ERT in different locations revealed significant deficits. It is
expected that an automated ERT training of models at various locations will
eliminate these differences.

*Guido Di Federico,Louis J. Durlofsky*

Main category: physics.geo-ph

TL;DR: 基于生成式潜在扩散模型(LDMs)开发了3D河道-堤坝-泥岩系统参数化方法，用于地质建模和历史匹配，能够生成无限多个地质实现并保持地质真实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统地质参数化方法需要将高维地质模型映射到低维潜在变量，这种方法在历史匹配中非常有用，因为校准变量数量大大减少，且能自动保持地质真实性。

Method: 使用生成式潜在扩散模型(LDMs)进行参数化，包含感知损失项以提高地质真实性，考虑泥岩比例、河道方向和宽度等场景参数，在LDM潜在空间中进行模型更新。

Result: 新生成的地质实现与参考模型在视觉和一阶、二阶空间统计上高度相似，流动响应分布也高度一致，在涉及地质场景不确定性的历史匹配中明显减少了生产预测和地质场景参数的不确定性。

Conclusion: 该方法为地质场景不确定性的历史匹配提供了有效的参数化方法，能够生成与真实模型一致的后验地质模型，在3D河道-堤坝-泥岩系统中表现出色。

Abstract: Geological parameterization procedures entail the mapping of a
high-dimensional geomodel to a low-dimensional latent variable. These
parameterizations can be very useful for history matching because the number of
variables to be calibrated is greatly reduced, and the mapping can be
constructed such that geological realism is automatically preserved. In this
work, a parameterization method based on generative latent diffusion models
(LDMs) is developed for 3D channel-levee-mud systems. Geomodels with variable
scenario parameters, specifically mud fraction, channel orientation, and
channel width, are considered. A perceptual loss term is included during
training to improve geological realism. For any set of scenario parameters, an
(essentially) infinite number of realizations can be generated, so our LDM
parameterizes over a very wide model space. New realizations constructed using
the LDM procedure are shown to closely resemble reference geomodels, both
visually and in terms of one- and two-point spatial statistics. Flow response
distributions, for a specified set of injection and production wells, are also
shown to be in close agreement between the two sets of models. The
parameterization method is applied for ensemble-based history matching, with
model updates performed in the LDM latent space, for cases involving geological
scenario uncertainty. For three synthetic true models corresponding to
different geological scenarios, we observe clear uncertainty reduction in both
production forecasts and geological scenario parameters. The overall method is
additionally shown to provide posterior geomodels consistent with the synthetic
true model in each case.

Abstract: A new approach, based on the analysis of a spectral problem for a discrete
gyroscopic system, to modelling earthquakes on a rotating planet is presented
in this paper. The eigenmodes of gyroscopic three-dimensional
icosahedron-dodecahedron lattices are used for the discrete approximations of
Earth's vibrations. Related model of the gyroscopic centred icosahedron lattice
reveals new results about the motion of Earth's core. The vibrations of the
tectonic plate boundaries, inducing shear and longitudinal motions of the
ground, are described through the oscillations of the nodal elements within the
discrete gyroscopic models. The theoretical analysis is complemented with the
illustrative numerical examples linked to natural resonant vibrations observed
during large earthquakes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地球物理流动具有快速旋转特性，传统显式方法需要极小时间步长来保证数值稳定性，计算成本高昂。需要开发更高效的数值方法来处理科里奥利力项。

Method: 在旋转球壳热对流模型中隐式处理科里奥利力项，采用牛顿法进行稳态求解，利用矩阵自由的Krylov方法快速求解线性系统。

Result: 计算了方位角波数4-12的旋转波分支，发现随着埃克曼数减小，流动趋于轴向独立并在内柱附近局部化。隐式方法比显式方法计算成本降低高达20倍（埃克曼数约10^{-5}时）。

Conclusion: 隐式处理科里奥利力项能有效提高数值稳定性，显著降低计算成本，特别适用于低埃克曼数情况，为地球物理流动模拟提供了高效数值工具。

Abstract: Geophysical flows are characterized by rapid rotation. Simulating these flows
requires small timesteps to achieve stability and accuracy. Numerical stability
can be greatly improved by the implicit integration of the terms that are most
responsible for destabilizing the numerical scheme. We have implemented an
implicit treatment of the Coriolis force in a rotating spherical shell driven
by a radial thermal gradient. We modified the resulting timestepping code to
carry out steady-state solving via Newton's method, which has no timestepping
error. The implicit terms have the effect of preconditioning the linear
systems, which can then be rapidly solved by a matrix-free Krylov method. We
computed the branches of rotating waves with azimuthal wavenumbers ranging from
4 to 12. As the Ekman number (the non-dimensionalized inverse rotation rate)
decreases, the flows are increasingly axially independent and localized near
the inner cylinder, in keeping with well-known theoretical predictions and
previous experimental and numerical results. The advantage of the implicit over
the explicit treatment also increases dramatically with decreasing Ekman
numbers, reducing the cost of computation by as much as a factor of 20 for
Ekman numbers of order of $10^{-5}$. We carried out continuation for both the
Rayleigh and Ekman numbers and obtained interesting branches in which the drift
velocity remained unchanged between pairs of saddle-node bifurcations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地质碳封存(GCS)是应对全球变暖的重要策略，但地下流动动力学的准确表征面临地质不确定性的挑战。现有逆向建模和不确定性量化方法计算成本高且缺乏泛化性，限制了实际应用。

Method: CoNFiLD-geo模型将条件神经场编码与贝叶斯条件潜在空间扩散模型相结合，通过无监督预训练和贝叶斯后验采样过程，实现复杂几何和网格结构下的零样本条件生成。

Result: 在合成和真实GCS场景中的全面验证表明，CoNFiLD-geo具有卓越的效率、泛化性、可扩展性和鲁棒性，能够有效支持数据同化、不确定性量化和可靠的前向建模。

Conclusion: CoNFiLD-geo显著推进了地质能源系统中的智能决策，支持向可持续、净零碳未来的转型，为地质碳封存提供了高效且不确定性感知的建模解决方案。

Abstract: Geological Carbon Sequestration (GCS) has emerged as a promising strategy for
mitigating global warming, yet its effectiveness heavily depends on accurately
characterizing subsurface flow dynamics. The inherent geological uncertainty,
stemming from limited observations and reservoir heterogeneity, poses
significant challenges to predictive modeling. Existing methods for inverse
modeling and uncertainty quantification are computationally intensive and lack
generalizability, restricting their practical utility. Here, we introduce a
Conditional Neural Field Latent Diffusion (CoNFiLD-geo) model, a generative
framework for efficient and uncertainty-aware forward and inverse modeling of
GCS processes. CoNFiLD-geo synergistically combines conditional neural field
encoding with Bayesian conditional latent-space diffusion models, enabling
zero-shot conditional generation of geomodels and reservoir responses across
complex geometries and grid structures. The model is pretrained unconditionally
in a self-supervised manner, followed by a Bayesian posterior sampling process,
allowing for data assimilation for unseen/unobserved states without
task-specific retraining. Comprehensive validation across synthetic and
real-world GCS scenarios demonstrates CoNFiLD-geo's superior efficiency,
generalization, scalability, and robustness. By enabling effective data
assimilation, uncertainty quantification, and reliable forward modeling,
CoNFiLD-geo significantly advances intelligent decision-making in geo-energy
systems, supporting the transition toward a sustainable, net-zero carbon
future.

Conclusion: 该扩展模型为CO2存储运作的设计和优化提供了重要的复杂权衡考虑，特别是注入能力与洒洒效率之间的担权关系。

Abstract: Numerical simulations of geological CO2 storage in deep saline aquifers have
demonstrated that vertical equilibrium (VE) models offer a robust and
computationally efficient framework for reservoir optimization and upscaling.
These studies emphasize the influence of fines migration and partial
miscibility between water and CO2 on the evolving storage behaviour.
Specifically, capillary-driven mobilization of clay and silica fines can impair
injectivity, while water evaporation into the CO2 phase leads to near-wellbore
drying, salt precipitation, and additional injectivity loss. However,
conventional VE models do not account for these coupled physical and
geochemical mechanisms. This work introduces an extended VE model that
incorporates water vaporization into CO2, CO2 dissolution into the displaced
brine, and fines migration leading to permeability reduction. For layer-cake
aquifers, the model admits an exact analytical solution, providing closed-form
expressions for both injectivity decline and sweep efficiency. The analysis
identifies two distinct fronts during displacement: a leading
displacement-dissolution front and a trailing full-evaporation front. Vertical
model downscaling further reveals that gas saturation varies with the
depth-dependent permeability profile. In formations where permeability
decreases with depth, saturation declines monotonically; in contrast, in
systems with increasing permeability, the competition between viscous and
gravitational forces can generate non-monotonic saturation profiles. The
results also indicate that while fines migration reduces injectivity, it may
simultaneously enhance sweep efficiency; highlighting a complex trade-off that
must be considered in the design and optimization of CO2 storage operations.

Abstract: Transient electromagnetic logging (TEL) is of great significance for
detecting deep formation structures outside the wellbore. Forward modeling
using analytical solutions requires frequency-domain calculations followed by
time-domain conversion. For electromagnetic field computations in horizontally
stratified media, mature Hankel transform methods already enable precise
solutions. However, for cylindrically stratified media, oscillatory integrals
involving cosine functions must be evaluated. This study employs the sine
transform to achieve frequency-to-time domain conversion for TEL, proposing a
new set of 125-point sine transform filter coefficients with enhanced
computational accuracy. For frequency-domain calculations in cylindrically
stratified media, the Gauss-Legendre quadrature rule combined with Levin-Sidi
extrapolation is adopted to accelerate the convergence of partial sum sequences
toward the true integral value. The accuracy of the proposed computational
method is verified through numerical experiments in both horizontally layered
and cylindrically stratified media.

Abstract: Urban climate resilience requires more than high-resolution data; it demands
systems that embed data collection, interpretation, and action within the daily
lives of citizens. This chapter presents a scalable, citizen-centric framework
that reimagines environmental infrastructure through participatory sensing,
open analytics, and prescriptive urban planning tools. Applied in Pune, India,
the framework comprises three interlinked modules: (1) a smartphone-based
measurement toolkit enhanced by AI segmentation to extract tree height, canopy
diameter, and trunk girth; (2) a percentile-based model using satellite-derived
Land Surface Temperature to calculate localized cooling through two new
metrics, Cooling Efficacy and Ambient Heat Relief; and (3) an eco-routing
engine that guides mobility using a Static Environmental Quality score, based
on tree density, species diversity, and cumulative carbon sequestration.
Together, these modules form a closed feedback loop where citizens generate
actionable data and benefit from personalized, sustainable interventions. This
framework transforms open data from a passive repository into an active

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在语义描述方面表现出色，但在深度数学和空间推理方面存在不足，需要专门的基准测试来评估这些核心推理技能。

Method: 通过精心筛选的函数库生成数学表面图，设计两个新任务：拓扑计数（识别和枚举局部极值等特征）和变换识别（识别几何变换），并进行严格的模糊性过滤。

Result: 即使是最先进的多模态大语言模型在该基准测试中也表现不佳，往往依赖表面启发式方法而非稳健的空间推理。

Conclusion: MaRVL-QA为研究社区提供了一个具有挑战性的新工具，可用于衡量进展、暴露模型局限性，并指导开发具有更深层次推理能力的多模态大语言模型。

Abstract: A key frontier for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is the ability to
perform deep mathematical and spatial reasoning directly from images, moving
beyond their established success in semantic description. Mathematical surface
plots provide a rigorous testbed for this capability, as they isolate the task
of reasoning from the semantic noise common in natural images. To measure
progress on this frontier, we introduce MaRVL-QA (Mathematical Reasoning over
Visual Landscapes), a new benchmark designed to quantitatively evaluate these
core reasoning skills. The benchmark comprises two novel tasks: Topological
Counting, identifying and enumerating features like local maxima; and
Transformation Recognition, recognizing applied geometric transformations.
Generated from a curated library of functions with rigorous ambiguity
filtering, our evaluation on MaRVL-QA reveals that even state-of-the-art MLLMs
struggle significantly, often resorting to superficial heuristics instead of
robust spatial reasoning. MaRVL-QA provides a challenging new tool for the
research community to measure progress, expose model limitations, and guide the
development of MLLMs with more profound reasoning abilities.

Method: 引入SEAM基准测试，使用四种具有现有标准化文本和视觉表示法的领域，通过不同的表示系统跨模态配对语义等效输入，与基于OCR的图像-文本配对形成对比。

Result: 在21个当代模型中观察到系统性的模态不平衡：视觉性能经常落后于语言性能，尽管问题包含语义等效信息，跨模态一致性相对较低。错误分析显示两个主要驱动因素：领域表示法中标记化导致的文本感知失败和引起幻觉的视觉感知失败。

Conclusion: SEAM建立了一个受控的语义等效设置，用于测量和改进模态无关的推理能力，结果对视觉变换具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Evaluating whether vision-language models (VLMs) reason consistently across
representations is challenging because modality comparisons are typically
confounded by task differences and asymmetric information. We introduce SEAM, a
benchmark that pairs semantically equivalent inputs across four domains that
have existing standardized textual and visual notations. By employing distinct
notation systems across modalities, in contrast to OCR-based image-text
pairing, SEAM provides a rigorous comparative assessment of the
textual-symbolic and visual-spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs. Across 21
contemporary models, we observe systematic modality imbalance: vision
frequently lags language in overall performance, despite the problems
containing semantically equivalent information, and cross-modal agreement is
relatively low. Our error analysis reveals two main drivers: textual perception
failures from tokenization in domain notation and visual perception failures
that induce hallucinations. We also show that our results are largely robust to
visual transformations. SEAM establishes a controlled, semantically equivalent
setting for measuring and improving modality-agnostic reasoning.

Motivation: 研究核壳命区边界层对地球磁场反转过程的影响，以明确稳定分层在磁流体动力学中的作用机制。

Method: 使用直接数值模拟方法，在球壱层中模拟不可压缩磁流体动力学方程，通过加入异质性热流破均衡对称性。

Result: 稳定分层使得磁场强度增加，且磁板和四极分量的增长率相似，促进磁极反转过程，还发现不同热流模式可触发半球动力学和磁极反转。

Conclusion: 核壳命区边界的稳定分层属于导体边界层，能够提高磁场强度并促进磁极反转，这与低维模型的动力学预测相符。

Abstract: We study the process of magnetic reversals in the presence of a
stably-stratified layer below the core-mantle boundary using direct numerical
simulations of the incompressible magnetohydrodynamics equations under the
Boussinesq approximation in a spherical shell. We show that the
dipolar-multipolar transition shifts to larger Rayleigh numbers in the presence
of a stably-stratified layer, and that the dipolar strength of the magnetic
field at the core-mantle boundary increases due to the skin effect. By imposing
an heterogeneous heat flux at the outer boundary, we break the equatorial
symmetry of the flow, and show that different heat flux patterns can trigger
different dynamo solutions, such as hemispheric dynamos and polarity reversals.
Using kinematic dynamo simulations, we show that the stably-stratified layer
leads to similar growth rates of the dipole and quadrupole components of the
magnetic field, playing the role of a conducting boundary layer, favouring
magnetic reversals, and a dynamics predicted by low-dimensional models.

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过直接数值模拟研究了旋转激流中气旋柱状结构的间歇急变现象，发现小波数加速时会出现能量向前传递的爆发事件，这是由椭圆不稳定性和Crow不稳定性导致的柱状旋激爆裂所致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旋转激流中气旋柱状结构的间歇急变现象，以及不同加速波数带对这种现象的影响，为了理解旋转激流中能量传递的复杂机制。

Method: 采用三维周期性箱中的直接数值模拟，应用随机各向同性加速在两个不同的波数带（kf = [3, 4]和[6, 7]），通过环谱和模态动能分析识别能量传递三元组。

Result: 只在小加速波数kf = [3, 4]时观察到间歇急变现象，这些事件与能量向前传递相关。气旋柱先变成椭圆形状，通过椭圆不稳定性和Crow不稳定性导致爆裂，然后在外部旋转作用下重新形成。

Conclusion: 这些爆发事件表明了椭圆不稳定性的失稳效应与外部旋转的稳定效应之间的挑战关系，为理解旋转激流中复杂的能量传递机制提供了新的视角。

Abstract: In this study, we report intermittent bursting of cyclonic columnar
structures in direct numerical simulations of forced rotating turbulence in a
three-dimensional (3D) periodic box. Columnar structure formation is associated
with dominant inverse cascade of energy in addition to the typical forward
cascade at large wavenumbers. The forcing is random and isotropic, applied in
two distinct wavenumber bands (kf = [3, 4] and [6, 7]). Notably, bursting is
observed only for small forcing wavenumber, kf = [3, 4] and not at kf = [6, 7],
for the same rotation rate and initial conditions. These bursting events are
associated with forward cascade of energy in contrast to the inverse cascade of
rotating turbulence, as confirmed from the ring spectrum and time-series of
modal kinetic energy of modes with kz = 2, 3. Identifying some of the triads
involved in the energy transfer from modal analysis, we also calculate the
mode-to-mode energy transfer. We find that, before the event, the circular
cyclonic vortex becomes elliptical due to cyclone-anticyclone interactions
leading to elliptical instability. We argue that energy transfer preceding the
bursting events to modes with higher kz triggers the Crow instability. These
instabilities ultimately lead to bursting of the columnar vortex, which
subsequently forms again due to the external rotation. Our results portray a
tug-of-war between the destabilizing effect of elliptical instability and the
stabilizing effect of external rotation.

Conclusion: 该方法能够快速生成高质量的非关键帧插值结果，在保持拓扑结构的同时提升几何重建精度

Abstract: This paper presents a neural scheme for the topology-aware interpolation of
time-varying scalar fields. Given a time-varying sequence of persistence
diagrams, along with a sparse temporal sampling of the corresponding scalar
fields, denoted as keyframes, our interpolation approach aims at "inverting"
the non-keyframe diagrams to produce plausible estimations of the
corresponding, missing data. For this, we rely on a neural architecture which
learns the relation from a time value to the corresponding scalar field, based
on the keyframe examples, and reliably extends this relation to the
non-keyframe time steps. We show how augmenting this architecture with specific
topological losses exploiting the input diagrams both improves the geometrical
and topological reconstruction of the non-keyframe time steps. At query time,
given an input time value for which an interpolation is desired, our approach
instantaneously produces an output, via a single propagation of the time input
through the network. Experiments interpolating 2D and 3D time-varying datasets
show our approach superiority, both in terms of data and topological fitting,
with regard to reference interpolation schemes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有远程心率监测系统难以区分心率变化是由于生理活动还是其他因素引起，缺乏对活动数据的有效整合，需要更准确的心率波动建模方法。

Method: 使用Transformer模型结合Laplace扩散技术，通过专门的嵌入和注意力机制将活动上下文作为整个建模过程的条件，包含情境化嵌入和专用编码器来捕获长期模式和活动特异性心率动态。

Result: 在29名患者4个月的真实数据上验证，相比最先进方法平均绝对误差降低43%，决定系数R²达到0.97，表明预测心率与实际值高度一致。

Conclusion: 该模型是支持医疗保健提供者和远程患者监测系统的实用有效工具，能够准确建模活动驱动的心率波动。

Abstract: With the advent of wearable Internet of Things (IoT) devices, remote patient
monitoring (RPM) emerged as a promising solution for managing heart failure.
However, the heart rate can fluctuate significantly due to various factors, and
without correlating it to the patient's actual physical activity, it becomes
difficult to assess whether changes are significant. Although Artificial
Intelligence (AI) models may enhance the accuracy and contextual understanding
of remote heart rate monitoring, the integration of activity data is still
rarely addressed. In this paper, we propose a Transformer model combined with a
Laplace diffusion technique to model heart rate fluctuations driven by physical
activity of the patient. Unlike prior models that treat activity as secondary,
our approach conditions the entire modeling process on activity context using
specialized embeddings and attention mechanisms to prioritize activity specific
historical patents. The model captures both long-term patterns and
activity-specific heart rate dynamics by incorporating contextualized
embeddings and dedicated encoder. The Transformer model was validated on a
real-world dataset collected from 29 patients over a 4-month period.
Experimental results show that our model outperforms current state-of-the-art
methods, achieving a 43% reduction in mean absolute error compared to the
considered baseline models. Moreover, the coefficient of determination R2 is
0.97 indicating the model predicted heart rate is in strong agreement with
actual heart rate values. These findings suggest that the proposed model is a
practical and effective tool for supporting both healthcare providers and
remote patient monitoring systems.

Abstract: Taxonomic classification in biodiversity research involves organizing
biological specimens into structured hierarchies based on evidence, which can
come from multiple modalities such as images and genetic information. We
investigate whether hyperbolic networks can provide a better embedding space
for such hierarchical models. Our method embeds multimodal inputs into a shared
hyperbolic space using contrastive and a novel stacked entailment-based
objective. Experiments on the BIOSCAN-1M dataset show that hyperbolic embedding
achieves competitive performance with Euclidean baselines, and outperforms all
other models on unseen species classification using DNA barcodes. However,
fine-grained classification and open-world generalization remain challenging.
Our framework offers a structure-aware foundation for biodiversity modelling,
with potential applications to species discovery, ecological monitoring, and
conservation efforts.

Conclusion: 该框架为地图对齐提供了可扩展且实用的解决方案，是传统方法的稳健高效替代方案。

Abstract: Map-to-map matching is a critical task for aligning spatial data across
heterogeneous sources, yet it remains challenging due to the lack of ground
truth correspondences, sparse node features, and scalability demands. In this
paper, we propose an unsupervised graph-based framework that addresses these
challenges through three key innovations. First, our method is an unsupervised
learning approach that requires no training data, which is crucial for
large-scale map data where obtaining labeled training samples is challenging.
Second, we introduce pseudo coordinates that capture the relative spatial
layout of nodes within each map, which enhances feature discriminability and
enables scale-invariant learning. Third, we design an mechanism to adaptively
balance feature and geometric similarity, as well as a geometric-consistent
loss function, ensuring robustness to noisy or incomplete coordinate data. At
the implementation level, to handle large-scale maps, we develop a tile-based
post-processing pipeline with overlapping regions and majority voting, which
enables parallel processing while preserving boundary coherence. Experiments on
real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
accuracy in matching tasks, surpassing existing methods by a large margin,
particularly in high-noise and large-scale scenarios. Our framework provides a
scalable and practical solution for map alignment, offering a robust and
efficient alternative to traditional approaches.

TL;DR: 提出了Polysemanticity Index (PSI)指标，用于量化神经网络中多义神经元的语义聚类特征，发现深层网络具有更高的多义性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络中存在响应多个不相关特征的多义神经元，这给机制可解释性带来了挑战，需要一种量化方法来识别和研究这些神经元。

Method: PSI指标结合几何聚类质量(S)、标注类别对齐度(Q)和CLIP开放词汇语义区分度(D)三个校准组件，在预训练的ResNet-50上使用Tiny-ImageNet图像进行评估。

Result: PSI成功识别出具有连贯可命名原型的神经元，发现深层网络比浅层网络具有显著更高的多义性，并通过因果补丁交换干预验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: PSI为发现、量化和研究神经网络中的多义单元提供了一个原则性和实用的工具。

Abstract: Neural networks often contain polysemantic neurons that respond to multiple,
sometimes unrelated, features, complicating mechanistic interpretability. We
introduce the Polysemanticity Index (PSI), a null-calibrated metric that
quantifies when a neuron's top activations decompose into semantically distinct
clusters. PSI multiplies three independently calibrated components: geometric
cluster quality (S), alignment to labeled categories (Q), and open-vocabulary
semantic distinctness via CLIP (D). On a pretrained ResNet-50 evaluated with
Tiny-ImageNet images, PSI identifies neurons whose activation sets split into
coherent, nameable prototypes, and reveals strong depth trends: later layers
exhibit substantially higher PSI than earlier layers. We validate our approach
with robustness checks (varying hyperparameters, random seeds, and
cross-encoder text heads), breadth analyses (comparing class-only vs.
open-vocabulary concepts), and causal patch-swap interventions. In particular,
aligned patch replacements increase target-neuron activation significantly more
than non-aligned, random, shuffled-position, or ablate-elsewhere controls. PSI
thus offers a principled and practical lever for discovering, quantifying, and
studying polysemantic units in neural networks.

Abstract: Clustering algorithms are widely used in various applications, with
density-based methods such as Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications
with Noise (DBSCAN) being particularly prominent. These algorithms identify
clusters in high-density regions while treating sparser areas as noise.
However, reliance on user-defined parameters often poses optimization
challenges that require domain expertise. This paper presents a novel
density-based clustering method inspired by the concept of selective attention,
which minimizes the need for user-defined parameters under standard conditions.
Initially, the algorithm operates without requiring user-defined parameters. If
parameter adjustment is needed, the method simplifies the process by
introducing a single integer parameter that is straightforward to tune. The
approach computes a threshold to filter out the most sparsely distributed
points and outliers, forms a preliminary cluster structure, and then
reintegrates the excluded points to finalize the results. Experimental
evaluations on diverse data sets highlight the accessibility and robust
performance of the method, providing an effective alternative for density-based
clustering tasks.

Conclusion: 提出的曲率学习方法通过平滑损失景观改善了HNNs的泛化能力，理论分析证明了方法的有效性和收敛性

Abstract: Hyperbolic neural networks (HNNs) have demonstrated notable efficacy in
representing real-world data with hierarchical structures via exploiting the
geometric properties of hyperbolic spaces characterized by negative curvatures.
Curvature plays a crucial role in optimizing HNNs. Inappropriate curvatures may
cause HNNs to converge to suboptimal parameters, degrading overall performance.
So far, the theoretical foundation of the effect of curvatures on HNNs has not
been developed. In this paper, we derive a PAC-Bayesian generalization bound of
HNNs, highlighting the role of curvatures in the generalization of HNNs via
their effect on the smoothness of the loss landscape. Driven by the derived
bound, we propose a sharpness-aware curvature learning method to smooth the
loss landscape, thereby improving the generalization of HNNs. In our method,
  we design a scope sharpness measure for curvatures, which is minimized
through a bi-level optimization process. Then, we introduce an implicit
differentiation algorithm that efficiently solves the bi-level optimization by
approximating gradients of curvatures. We present the approximation error and
convergence analyses of the proposed method, showing that the approximation
error is upper-bounded, and the proposed method can converge by bounding
gradients of HNNs. Experiments on four settings: classification, learning from
long-tailed data, learning from noisy data, and few-shot learning show that our
method can improve the performance of HNNs.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel generative framework for learning shared latent
representations across multimodal data. Many advanced multimodal methods focus
on capturing all combinations of modality-specific details across inputs, which
can inadvertently obscure the high-level semantic concepts that are shared
across modalities. Notably, Multimodal VAEs with low-dimensional latent
variables are designed to capture shared representations, enabling various
tasks such as joint multimodal synthesis and cross-modal inference. However,
multimodal VAEs often struggle to design expressive joint variational
posteriors and suffer from low-quality synthesis. In this work, ShaLa addresses
these challenges by integrating a novel architectural inference model and a
second-stage expressive diffusion prior, which not only facilitates effective
inference of shared latent representation but also significantly improves the
quality of downstream multimodal synthesis. We validate ShaLa extensively
across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating superior coherence and synthesis
quality compared to state-of-the-art multimodal VAEs. Furthermore, ShaLa scales
to many more modalities while prior multimodal VAEs have fallen short in
capturing the increasing complexity of the shared latent space.

Conclusion: 基于适配器的方法在不同骨干架构和大规模对抗训练中均表现出有效性，为构建可信基础模型提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: Adversarial training (AT) with projected gradient descent is the most popular
method to improve model robustness under adversarial attacks. However,
computational overheads become prohibitively large when AT is applied to large
backbone models. AT is also known to have the issue of robust overfitting. This
paper contributes to solving both problems simultaneously towards building more
trustworthy foundation models. In particular, we propose a new adapter-based
approach for efficient AT directly in the feature space. We show that the
proposed adapter-based approach can improve the inner-loop convergence quality
by eliminating robust overfitting. As a result, it significantly increases
computational efficiency and improves model accuracy by generalizing
adversarial robustness to unseen attacks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
the new adapter-based approach in different backbone architectures and in AT at
scale.

Abstract: Recently, detection of label errors and improvement of label quality in
datasets for supervised learning tasks has become an increasingly important
goal in both research and industry. The consequences of incorrectly annotated
data include reduced model performance, biased benchmark results, and lower
overall accuracy. Current state-of-the-art label error detection methods often
focus on a single computer vision task and, consequently, a specific type of
dataset, containing, for example, either bounding boxes or pixel-wise
annotations. Furthermore, previous methods are not learning-based. In this
work, we overcome this research gap. We present a unified method for detecting
label errors in object detection, semantic segmentation, and instance
segmentation datasets. In a nutshell, our approach - learning to detect label
errors by making them - works as follows: we inject different kinds of label
errors into the ground truth. Then, the detection of label errors, across all
mentioned primary tasks, is framed as an instance segmentation problem based on
a composite input. In our experiments, we compare the label error detection
performance of our method with various baselines and state-of-the-art
approaches of each task's domain on simulated label errors across multiple
tasks, datasets, and base models. This is complemented by a generalization
study on real-world label errors. Additionally, we release 459 real label
errors identified in the Cityscapes dataset and provide a benchmark for real
label error detection in Cityscapes.

Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) has emerged as a promising paradigm for
achieving unprecedented communication efficiency in sixth-generation (6G)
networks by leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to extract and transmit the
underlying meanings of source data. However, deploying SemCom over digital
systems presents new challenges, particularly in ensuring robustness against
transmission errors that may distort semantically critical content. To address
this issue, this paper proposes a novel framework, termed generative feature
imputing, which comprises three key techniques. First, we introduce a spatial
error concentration packetization strategy that spatially concentrates feature
distortions by encoding feature elements based on their channel mappings, a
property crucial for both the effectiveness and reduced complexity of the
subsequent techniques. Second, building on this strategy, we propose a
generative feature imputing method that utilizes a diffusion model to
efficiently reconstruct missing features caused by packet losses. Finally, we
develop a semantic-aware power allocation scheme that enables unequal error
protection by allocating transmission power according to the semantic
importance of each packet. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
framework outperforms conventional approaches, such as Deep Joint
Source-Channel Coding (DJSCC) and JPEG2000, under block fading conditions,
achieving higher semantic accuracy and lower Learned Perceptual Image Patch
Similarity (LPIPS) scores.

Abstract: Autonomous planetary exploration missions are critically dependent on
real-time, accurate environmental perception for navigation and hazard
avoidance. However, deploying deep learning models on the resource-constrained
computational hardware of planetary exploration platforms remains a significant
challenge. This paper introduces the Adaptive Quantized Planetary Crater
Detection System (AQ-PCDSys), a novel framework specifically engineered for
real-time, onboard deployment in the computationally constrained environments
of space exploration missions. AQ-PCDSys synergistically integrates a Quantized
Neural Network (QNN) architecture, trained using Quantization-Aware Training
(QAT), with an Adaptive Multi-Sensor Fusion (AMF) module. The QNN architecture
significantly optimizes model size and inference latency suitable for real-time
onboard deployment in space exploration missions, while preserving high
accuracy. The AMF module intelligently fuses data from Optical Imagery (OI) and
Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) at the feature level, utilizing an Adaptive
Weighting Mechanism (AWM) to dynamically prioritize the most relevant and
reliable sensor modality based on planetary ambient conditions. This approach
enhances detection robustness across diverse planetary landscapes. Paired with
Multi-Scale Detection Heads specifically designed for robust and efficient
detection of craters across a wide range of sizes, AQ-PCDSys provides a
computationally efficient, reliable and accurate solution for planetary crater
detection, a critical capability for enabling the next generation of autonomous
planetary landing, navigation, and scientific exploration.

transforming multimedia communication. This paper systematically reviews key
recent advancements across generative AI for multimedia communication,
emphasizing transformative models like diffusion and transformers. However,

meaningful multimedia communication systems by bridging generative AI
innovations with information theory. This exploratory paper aims to inspire a
semantic-first paradigm shift, offering a fresh perspective with significant

Abstract: The fast development of technology and artificial intelligence has
significantly advanced Autonomous Vehicle (AV) research, emphasizing the need
for extensive simulation testing. Accurate and adaptable maps are critical in
AV development, serving as the foundation for localization, path planning, and

presents a custom workflow to streamline map creation for AV development,
demonstrated through the generation of a 3D map of a parking lot at Ontario

Motivation: 四足机器人配备机械臂后能够在复杂地形执行物理交互任务，但传统方法需要大量真实世界校准和预编程抓取配置，限制了精确性和适应性。

Method: 在Genesis仿真环境中生成合成抓取数据集，创建像素级标注的抓取质量图，训练基于U-Net架构的多模态CNN模型处理RGB、深度、分割掩码和表面法线图，输出最优抓取点热图。

Abstract: Quadruped robots have emerged as highly efficient and versatile platforms,
excelling in navigating complex and unstructured terrains where traditional
wheeled robots might fail. Equipping these robots with manipulator arms unlocks
the advanced capability of loco-manipulation to perform complex physical
interaction tasks in areas ranging from industrial automation to
search-and-rescue missions. However, achieving precise and adaptable grasping
in such dynamic scenarios remains a significant challenge, often hindered by
the need for extensive real-world calibration and pre-programmed grasp
configurations. This paper introduces a deep learning framework designed to
enhance the grasping capabilities of quadrupeds equipped with arms, focusing on
improved precision and adaptability. Our approach centers on a sim-to-real
methodology that minimizes reliance on physical data collection. We developed a
pipeline within the Genesis simulation environment to generate a synthetic
dataset of grasp attempts on common objects. By simulating thousands of
interactions from various perspectives, we created pixel-wise annotated
grasp-quality maps to serve as the ground truth for our model. This dataset was
used to train a custom CNN with a U-Net-like architecture that processes
multi-modal input from an onboard RGB and depth cameras, including RGB images,
depth maps, segmentation masks, and surface normal maps. The trained model
outputs a grasp-quality heatmap to identify the optimal grasp point. We
validated the complete framework on a four-legged robot. The system
successfully executed a full loco-manipulation task: autonomously navigating to
a target object, perceiving it with its sensors, predicting the optimal grasp
pose using our model, and performing a precise grasp. This work proves that
leveraging simulated training with advanced sensing offers a scalable and
effective solution for object handling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图像的世界模型缺乏稳健的几何信息，需要三维空间和物理理解，即使在大规模视频数据上预训练也存在局限性

Method: 使用潜在扩散变换器(DiT)结合3D变分自编码器，通过高斯泼溅技术推断高斯原语在机器人动作作用下的传播，实现场景级未来状态重建

Conclusion: GWM展示了3D世界模型在数据扩展方面的潜力，既能增强模仿学习的视觉表示，又能作为支持基于模型强化学习的神经模拟器

Abstract: Training robot policies within a learned world model is trending due to the
inefficiency of real-world interactions. The established image-based world
models and policies have shown prior success, but lack robust geometric
information that requires consistent spatial and physical understanding of the
three-dimensional world, even pre-trained on internet-scale video sources. To
this end, we propose a novel branch of world model named Gaussian World Model
(GWM) for robotic manipulation, which reconstructs the future state by
inferring the propagation of Gaussian primitives under the effect of robot
actions. At its core is a latent Diffusion Transformer (DiT) combined with a 3D
variational autoencoder, enabling fine-grained scene-level future state
reconstruction with Gaussian Splatting. GWM can not only enhance the visual
representation for imitation learning agent by self-supervised future
prediction training, but can serve as a neural simulator that supports
model-based reinforcement learning. Both simulated and real-world experiments
depict that GWM can precisely predict future scenes conditioned on diverse
robot actions, and can be further utilized to train policies that outperform
the state-of-the-art by impressive margins, showcasing the initial data scaling
potential of 3D world model.

Motivation: 事件相机具有微秒级延迟、高动态范围和低功耗优势，但主流机器人模拟器中缺乏合成事件视觉模拟，影响了事件驱动方法在机器人任务中的评估。

Method: 开发了一个开源的v2e ROS包，能够从RGB相机输入生成无缝事件流。通过行为克隆训练Transformer基于事件的机器人策略，并与RGB基础策略在两个代表性场景下进行对比评测：移动机器人物体跟随和机器手物体检测与抓取。

Conclusion: 该研究为更广泛地将事件相机集成到机器人策略学习中奠定了基础，展示了事件驱动感知在实时机器人应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Event cameras offer microsecond latency, high dynamic range, and low power
consumption, making them ideal for real-time robotic perception under
challenging conditions such as motion blur, occlusion, and illumination
changes. However, despite their advantages, synthetic event-based vision
remains largely unexplored in mainstream robotics simulators. This lack of
simulation setup hinders the evaluation of event-driven approaches for robotic
manipulation and navigation tasks. This work presents an open-source,
user-friendly v2e robotics operating system (ROS) package for Gazebo simulation
that enables seamless event stream generation from RGB camera feeds. The
package is used to investigate event-based robotic policies (ERP) for real-time
navigation and manipulation. Two representative scenarios are evaluated: (1)
object following with a mobile robot and (2) object detection and grasping with
a robotic manipulator. Transformer-based ERPs are trained by behavior cloning
and compared to RGB-based counterparts under various operating conditions.
Experimental results show that event-guided policies consistently deliver
competitive advantages. The results highlight the potential of event-driven
perception to improve real-time robotic navigation and manipulation, providing
a foundation for broader integration of event cameras into robotic policy
learning. The GitHub repo for the dataset and code:

TL;DR: 本文提出了任务/指令相关的物体可操作性（affordance）概念，构建了包含1.5万个物体-指令-可操作性三元组的数据集，并开发了基于大型多模态模型的"搜索验证"推理流程来预测指令导向的可操作性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究忽视了可操作性的任务/指令依赖性，即同一物体在不同指令下会产生不同的操作区域和方向。本文旨在解决这一被忽视的问题。

Method: 构建了包含1.5万个三元组的数据集（以自我中心视角设计），并提出"搜索验证"流程：让大型多模态模型逐步预测可操作性，并在迭代过程中通过自我验证来模仿推理过程。

Result: 实验表明该方法不仅解锁了新的指令导向可操作性预测能力，而且在广泛范围内取得了优异性能。

Conclusion: 任务/指令相关的可操作性概念对于智能机器人物体操作至关重要，基于大型多模态模型的搜索验证方法能够有效预测指令导向的可操作性。

Abstract: Affordance is crucial for intelligent robots in the context of object
manipulation. In this paper, we argue that affordance should be
task-/instruction-dependent, which is overlooked by many previous works. That
is, different instructions can lead to different manipulation regions and
directions even for the same object. According to this observation, we present
a new dataset comprising fifteen thousand object-instruction-affordance
triplets. All scenes in the dataset are from an egocentric viewpoint, designed
to approximate the perspective of a human-like robot. Furthermore, we
investigate how to enable large multimodal models (LMMs) to serve as affordance
predictors by implementing a ``search against verifiers'' pipeline. An LMM is
asked to progressively predict affordances, with the output at each step being
verified by itself during the iterative process, imitating a reasoning process.
Experiments show that our method not only unlocks new instruction-oriented
affordance prediction capabilities, but also achieves outstanding performance
broadly.

Conclusion: 提出的多模态自监督框架通过有效整合异构传感器模态，显著提升了可通行性估计的准确性和鲁棒性

Abstract: Traversability estimation is critical for enabling robots to navigate across
diverse terrains and environments. While recent self-supervised learning
methods achieve promising results, they often fail to capture the
characteristics of non-traversable regions. Moreover, most prior works
concentrate on a single modality, overlooking the complementary strengths
offered by integrating heterogeneous sensory modalities for more robust
traversability estimation. To address these limitations, we propose a
multimodal self-supervised framework for traversability labeling and
estimation. First, our annotation pipeline integrates footprint, LiDAR, and
camera data as prompts for a vision foundation model, generating traversability
labels that account for both semantic and geometric cues. Then, leveraging
these labels, we train a dual-stream network that jointly learns from different
modalities in a decoupled manner, enhancing its capacity to recognize diverse
traversability patterns. In addition, we incorporate sparse LiDAR-based
supervision to mitigate the noise introduced by pseudo labels. Finally,
extensive experiments conducted across urban, off-road, and campus environments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. The proposed automatic labeling
method consistently achieves around 88% IoU across diverse datasets. Compared
to existing self-supervised state-of-the-art methods, our multimodal
traversability estimation network yields consistently higher IoU, improving by
1.6-3.5% on all evaluated datasets.

Motivation: 角分辨散射测量术存在数据采集时间过长的问题，影响纳米制造环境中的表面质量检测效率。

Method: 提出基于粒子群优化算法的缩减学习框架，为散射图案定制采样方案，识别最优采样点以最大化ZnO纳米表面缺陷检测准确率。

Result: 仅采集1%数据即可达到86%准确率，6%采样率时提升至94%，甚至在噪声环境中仍保持高准确度。

Conclusion: 该方法在数据减少和分类性能之间实现了良好平衡，能够有效识别关键采样区域，为高效纳米表面检测提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Nanoscale manufacturing requires high-precision surface inspection to
guarantee the quality of the produced nanostructures. For production
environments, angle-resolved scatterometry offers a non- invasive and in-line
compatible alternative to traditional surface inspection methods, such as
scanning electron microscopy. However, angle-resolved scatterometry currently
suffers from long data acquisition time. Our study addresses the issue of slow
data acquisition by proposing a compressed learning framework for the accurate
recognition of nanosurface deficiencies using angle-resolved scatterometry
data. The framework uses the particle swarm optimization algorithm with a
sampling scheme customized for scattering patterns. This combination allows the
identification of optimal sampling points in scatterometry data that maximize
the detection accuracy of five different levels of deficiency in ZnO
nanosurfaces. The proposed method significantly reduces the amount of sampled
data while maintaining a high accuracy in deficiency detection, even in noisy
environments. Notably, by sampling only 1% of the data, the method achieves an
accuracy of over 86%, which further improves to 94% when the sampling rate is
increased to 6%. These results demonstrate a favorable balance between data
reduction and classification performance. The obtained results also show that
the compressed learning framework effectively identifies critical sampling
areas.

Method: 利用手部运动的时序数据，在810个试验中评估分类和回归方法，涉及不同物体类型、尺寸和操作方式。

Result: 分类模型在跨用户泛化方面表现不一致，而回归方法（特别是LSTM）表现更稳健，在抓取前2秒关键窗口内时间误差<0.25秒，距离误差5-20厘米。

Conclusion: 回归模型能更好地适应VR中用户行为的动态复杂性，为实时预测用户动作和自适应触觉反馈奠定了基础。

Abstract: Predicting user intentions in virtual reality (VR) is crucial for creating
immersive experiences, particularly in tasks involving complex grasping motions
where accurate haptic feedback is essential. In this work, we leverage
time-series data from hand movements to evaluate both classification and
regression approaches across 810 trials with varied object types, sizes, and
manipulations. Our findings reveal that classification models struggle to
generalize across users, leading to inconsistent performance. In contrast,
regression-based approaches, particularly those using Long Short Term Memory
(LSTM) networks, demonstrate more robust performance, with timing errors within
0.25 seconds and distance errors around 5-20 cm in the critical two-second
window before a grasp. Despite these improvements, predicting precise hand
postures remains challenging. Through a comprehensive analysis of user
variability and model interpretability, we explore why certain models fail and
how regression models better accommodate the dynamic and complex nature of user
behavior in VR. Our results underscore the potential of machine learning models
to enhance VR interactions, particularly through adaptive haptic feedback, and
lay the groundwork for future advancements in real-time prediction of user
actions in VR.

Abstract: Spatial proteomics maps protein distributions in tissues, providing
transformative insights for life sciences. However, current sequencing-based
technologies suffer from low spatial resolution, and substantial inter-tissue
variability in protein expression further compromises the performance of
existing molecular data prediction methods. In this work, we introduce the
novel task of spatial super-resolution for sequencing-based spatial proteomics
(seq-SP) and, to the best of our knowledge, propose the first deep learning
model for this task--Neural Proteomics Fields (NPF). NPF formulates seq-SP as a
protein reconstruction problem in continuous space by training a dedicated
network for each tissue. The model comprises a Spatial Modeling Module, which
learns tissue-specific protein spatial distributions, and a Morphology Modeling
Module, which extracts tissue-specific morphological features. Furthermore, to
facilitate rigorous evaluation, we establish an open-source benchmark dataset,
Pseudo-Visium SP, for this task. Experimental results demonstrate that NPF
achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer learnable parameters,
underscoring its potential for advancing spatial proteomics research. Our code
and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/Bokai-Zhao/NPF.

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation produce visually realistic content, yet
the absence of synchronized audio severely compromises immersion. To address
key challenges in video-to-audio generation, including multimodal data
scarcity, modality imbalance and limited audio quality in existing methods, we
propose HunyuanVideo-Foley, an end-to-end text-video-to-audio framework that
synthesizes high-fidelity audio precisely aligned with visual dynamics and
semantic context. Our approach incorporates three core innovations: (1) a
scalable data pipeline curating 100k-hour multimodal datasets through automated
annotation; (2) a representation alignment strategy using self-supervised audio
features to guide latent diffusion training, efficiently improving audio
quality and generation stability; (3) a novel multimodal diffusion transformer
resolving modal competition, containing dual-stream audio-video fusion through
joint attention, and textual semantic injection via cross-attention.
Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that HunyuanVideo-Foley achieves new
state-of-the-art performance across audio fidelity, visual-semantic alignment,
temporal alignment and distribution matching. The demo page is available at:

Abstract: Modeling the wave nature of light and the propagation and diffraction of
electromagnetic fields is crucial for the accurate simulation of many
phenomena, yet wave simulations are significantly more computationally complex
than classical ray-based models. In this work, we start by analyzing the
classical path integral formulation of light transport and rigorously study
which wave-optical phenomena can be reproduced by it. We then introduce a
bilinear path integral generalization for wave-optical light transport that
models the wave interference between paths. This formulation subsumes many
existing methods that rely on shooting-bouncing rays or UTD-based diffractions,
and serves to give insight into the challenges of such approaches and the
difficulty of sampling good paths in a bilinear setting.
  With this foundation, we develop a weakly-local path integral based on
region-to-region transport using elliptical cones that allows sampling
individual paths that still model wave effects accurately. As with the classic
path integral form of the light transport equation, our path integral makes it
possible to derive a variety of practical transport algorithms. We present a
complete system for wave tracing with elliptical cones, with applications in
light transport for rendering and efficient simulation of long-wavelength
radiation propagation and diffraction in complex environments.

Abstract: Quantifying and forecasting individual brain aging trajectories is critical
for understanding neurodegenerative disease and the heterogeneity of aging, yet
current approaches remain limited. Most models predict chronological age, an
imperfect surrogate for biological aging, or generate synthetic MRIs that
enhance data diversity but fail to capture subject-specific trajectories. Here,
we present BrainPath, a 3D generative framework that learns longitudinal brain
aging dynamics during training and, at inference, predicts anatomically
faithful MRIs at arbitrary timepoints from a single baseline scan. BrainPath
integrates an age calibration loss, a swap learning strategy, and an age
perceptual loss to preserve subtle, biologically meaningful variations. Across
held-out ADNI and an independent NACC dataset, BrainPath outperforms
state-of-the-art reference models in structural similarity (SSIM), mean squared
error (MSE), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and MRI age-difference
accuracy, while capturing realistic and temporally consistent aging patterns.
Beyond methodological innovation, BrainPath enables personalized mapping of
brain aging, synthetic follow-up scan prediction, and trajectory-based
analyses, providing a foundation for precision modeling of brain aging and
supporting research into neurodegeneration and aging interventions.
