Abstract: As the computer vision community advances autonomous driving algorithms,
integrating vision-based insights with sensor data remains essential for
improving perception, decision making, planning, prediction, simulation, and
control. Yet we must ask: Why don't we have entirely safe self-driving cars
yet? A key part of the answer lies in addressing novel scenarios, one of the
most critical barriers to real-world deployment. Our 2COOOL workshop provides a
dedicated forum for researchers and industry experts to push the state of the
art in novelty handling, including out-of-distribution hazard detection,
vision-language models for hazard understanding, new benchmarking and
methodologies, and safe autonomous driving practices. The 2nd Workshop on the
Challenge of Out-of-Label Hazards in Autonomous Driving (2COOOL) will be held
at the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 2025 in Honolulu,
Hawaii, on October 19, 2025. We aim to inspire the development of new
algorithms and systems for hazard avoidance, drawing on ideas from anomaly
detection, open-set recognition, open-vocabulary modeling, domain adaptation,
and related fields. Building on the success of its inaugural edition at the
Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV) 2025, the workshop
will feature a mix of academic and industry participation.

### [2] [Advanced Deep Learning Techniques for Classifying Dental Conditions Using Panoramic X-Ray Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21088)
*Alireza Golkarieh,Kiana Kiashemshaki,Sajjad Rezvani Boroujeni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估了三种深度学习方法来分类全景X射线图像中的牙齿状况，发现CNN与随机森林的混合模型表现最佳，准确率达到85.4%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发自动化牙齿状况分类系统，为牙科诊断提供可靠支持，提高诊断效率和准确性

Method: 使用1,512张全景X射线图像和11,137个专家标注，评估三种方法：自定义CNN、CNN与传统分类器的混合模型、预训练架构微调，采用5折交叉验证

Result: 混合CNN随机森林模型准确率最高（85.4%），优于自定义CNN基线（74.3%）；预训练模型中VGG16表现最好（82.3%），混合模型在形态相似状况的区分上表现更佳

Conclusion: CNN特征提取与集成分类器结合是自动化牙科诊断支持的有效途径，但需要更大数据集和进一步临床验证

Abstract: This study investigates deep learning methods for automated classification of
dental conditions in panoramic X-ray images. A dataset of 1,512 radiographs
with 11,137 expert-verified annotations across four conditions fillings,
cavities, implants, and impacted teeth was used. After preprocessing and class
balancing, three approaches were evaluated: a custom convolutional neural
network (CNN), hybrid models combining CNN feature extraction with traditional
classifiers, and fine-tuned pre-trained architectures. Experiments employed 5
fold cross validation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score as
evaluation metrics. The hybrid CNN Random Forest model achieved the highest
performance with 85.4% accuracy, surpassing the custom CNN baseline of 74.3%.
Among pre-trained models, VGG16 performed best at 82.3% accuracy, followed by
Xception and ResNet50. Results show that hybrid models improve discrimination
of morphologically similar conditions and provide efficient, reliable
performance. These findings suggest that combining CNN-based feature extraction
with ensemble classifiers offers a practical path toward automated dental
diagnostic support, while also highlighting the need for larger datasets and
further clinical validation.

*Namu Kim,Wonbin Kweon,Minsoo Kim,Hwanjo Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Q-Align通过Query-Query对齐解决大模型零样本外观迁移中的注意力泄漏问题，在保持结构的同时显著提升外观保真度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模图像生成模型在零样本外观迁移中存在注意力泄漏问题，这是由于Query-Key对齐捕获语义映射时的缺陷导致的

Method: 提出Q-Align方法，包含三个核心贡献：1) Query-Query对齐实现精细空间语义映射；2) Key-Value重排增强特征对应；3) 使用重排后的键值进行注意力精化以保持语义一致性

Result: 通过大量实验验证，Q-Align在外观保真度方面优于最先进方法，同时保持竞争力的结构保持能力

Conclusion: Q-Align有效解决了注意力泄漏问题，为零样本外观迁移提供了更优的语义对齐方案

Abstract: We observe that zero-shot appearance transfer with large-scale image
generation models faces a significant challenge: Attention Leakage. This
challenge arises when the semantic mapping between two images is captured by
the Query-Key alignment. To tackle this issue, we introduce Q-Align, utilizing
Query-Query alignment to mitigate attention leakage and improve the semantic
alignment in zero-shot appearance transfer. Q-Align incorporates three core
contributions: (1) Query-Query alignment, facilitating the sophisticated
spatial semantic mapping between two images; (2) Key-Value rearrangement,
enhancing feature correspondence through realignment; and (3) Attention
refinement using rearranged keys and values to maintain semantic consistency.
We validate the effectiveness of Q-Align through extensive experiments and
analysis, and Q-Align outperforms state-of-the-art methods in appearance
fidelity while maintaining competitive structure preservation.

### [4] [ERTACache: Error Rectification and Timesteps Adjustment for Efficient Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21091)
*Xurui Peng,Hong Liu,Chenqian Yan,Rui Ma,Fangmin Chen,Xing Wang,Zhihua Wu,Songwei Liu,Mingbao Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ERTACache是一个针对扩散模型的缓存加速框架，通过分析缓存误差的两个主要来源（特征偏移误差和步长放大误差），采用残差分析、动态调整积分间隔和误差线性化模型，在保持视觉质量的同时实现2倍推理加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型由于迭代推理过程导致计算开销巨大，特征缓存虽然能加速但简单重用会导致明显的质量下降，需要解决缓存引入的累积误差问题。

Method: 提出ERTACache框架：1）离线残差分析识别可重用步骤；2）通过轨迹感知校正系数动态调整积分间隔；3）使用闭式残差线性化模型近似缓存误差；三者协同实现高效准确的采样。

Result: 在标准图像和视频生成基准测试中，ERTACache实现高达2倍推理加速，同时保持甚至改善视觉质量。在Wan2.1视频扩散模型上，2倍加速下VBench指标退化极小，有效保持基准保真度。

Conclusion: ERTACache通过系统性地分析和解决缓存误差问题，为扩散模型提供了既高效又高质量的推理加速方案，在保持生成质量的同时显著提升效率。

Abstract: Diffusion models suffer from substantial computational overhead due to their
inherently iterative inference process. While feature caching offers a
promising acceleration strategy by reusing intermediate outputs across
timesteps, naive reuse often incurs noticeable quality degradation. In this
work, we formally analyze the cumulative error introduced by caching and
decompose it into two principal components: feature shift error, caused by
inaccuracies in cached outputs, and step amplification error, which arises from
error propagation under fixed timestep schedules. To address these issues, we
propose ERTACache, a principled caching framework that jointly rectifies both
error types. Our method employs an offline residual profiling stage to identify
reusable steps, dynamically adjusts integration intervals via a
trajectory-aware correction coefficient, and analytically approximates
cache-induced errors through a closed-form residual linearization model.
Together, these components enable accurate and efficient sampling under
aggressive cache reuse. Extensive experiments across standard image and video
generation benchmarks show that ERTACache achieves up to 2x inference speedup
while consistently preserving or even improving visual quality. Notably, on the
state-of-the-art Wan2.1 video diffusion model, ERTACache delivers 2x
acceleration with minimal VBench degradation, effectively maintaining baseline
fidelity while significantly improving efficiency. The code is available at
https://github.com/bytedance/ERTACache.

### [5] [Entropy-Based Non-Invasive Reliability Monitoring of Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21715)
*Amirhossein Nazeri,Wael Hafez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过监测CNN激活熵变化来检测对抗样本，无需修改模型即可实现90%检测准确率，假阳性和假阴性率低于20%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗样本检测方法需要昂贵重训练、修改网络架构或影响干净输入性能，而对抗扰动会在CNN激活中产生可检测的熵特征

Method: 在VGG-16上使用并行熵监测，分析早期卷积层的激活熵变化

Result: 对抗输入使早期卷积层激活熵一致偏移7%，实现90%检测准确率，假阳性和假阴性率低于20%，干净和对抗样本的熵分布完全分离

Conclusion: CNN可靠性可通过激活熵单独评估，支持实时检测对抗输入的自诊断视觉系统部署，且不影响原始模型性能

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the foundation of modern
computer vision, achieving unprecedented accuracy across diverse image
recognition tasks. While these networks excel on in-distribution data, they
remain vulnerable to adversarial perturbations imperceptible input
modifications that cause misclassification with high confidence. However,
existing detection methods either require expensive retraining, modify network
architecture, or degrade performance on clean inputs. Here we show that
adversarial perturbations create immediate, detectable entropy signatures in
CNN activations that can be monitored without any model modification. Using
parallel entropy monitoring on VGG-16, we demonstrate that adversarial inputs
consistently shift activation entropy by 7% in early convolutional layers,
enabling 90% detection accuracy with false positives and false negative rates
below 20%. The complete separation between clean and adversarial entropy
distributions reveals that CNNs inherently encode distribution shifts in their
activation patterns. This work establishes that CNN reliability can be assessed
through activation entropy alone, enabling practical deployment of
self-diagnostic vision systems that detect adversarial inputs in real-time
without compromising original model performance.

### [6] [Video-LLMs with Temporal Visual Screening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21094)
*Zheyu Fan,Jiateng Liu,Yuji Zhang,Zihan Wang,Yi R.,Fung,Manling Li,Heng Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Temporal Visual Screening (TVS)任务，通过保留关键视频片段和重构查询来优化视频语言模型的时间语义理解，在训练和推理阶段分别带来7.33%和34.6%的性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频大语言模型由于稀疏帧采样和帧间推理监督不足，难以捕捉细粒度时间语义，而人类能够通过拖动进度条进行时间筛选

Method: TVS作为模块化前端适配器任务，包含：(1)保留焦点关键视频片段，(2)同步重构查询为最直接形式，(3)保持答案不变性和一致性

Result: 提出的ReSimplifyIt基线在视频修剪任务上F-1分数提升0.47，查询重写性能具有竞争力，TVS集成带来训练阶段7.33%和推理阶段34.6%的相对增益

Conclusion: TVS通过优化推理负担和认知负载分布，有效提升了视频语言理解能力，证明了时间信息筛选的重要性

Abstract: Humans naturally perform temporal screening by dragging the progress bar and
focusing on salient temporal segments, but current Video Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs) struggle to capture fine-grained temporal semantics due to sparse
frame sampling and insufficient inter-frame reasoning supervision during their
training. To address this, Inspired by well-established cognitive science
principles, we propose Temporal Visual Screening (TVS), a new task that
universally pre-processes video question answering and instruction tuning data
by: (1) retaining focus-critical video segments, (2) synchronously
reconstructing queries to their most direct form while preserving answer
consistency, and (3) keeping the invariance and consistency for any possible
answer. TVS is formulated as a modular front-end adapter task that can be
seamlessly integrated into both Video Instruction Tuning (training) and Video
Question Answering (inference) pipelines. TVS optimizes distribution of
reasoning burden and cognitive load; during training, it aligns queries with
focus-critical visual information; at inference, it enables query-aware segment
focus and streamlined query representations. In particular, we curate the first
benchmark for TVS and propose ReSimplifyIt, a baseline outperforming prior
approaches on seemingly similar tasks by 0.47 in F-1 score on video trimming
while achieving competitive query rewriting performance. Experiments
demonstrate that incorporating TVS yields relative gains of 7.33% (training)
and 34.6% (inference), demonstrating the effectiveness of temporal information
screening for improving video-language understanding.

### [7] [ROBUST-MIPS: A Combined Skeletal Pose and Instance Segmentation Dataset for Laparoscopic Surgical Instruments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21096)
*Zhe Han,Charlie Budd,Gongyu Zhang,Huanyu Tian,Christos Bergeles,Tom Vercauteren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ROBUST-MIPS数据集，将手术工具的姿态标注与实例分割标注结合，证明姿态标注在手术工具定位任务中具有高效性和高质量表现


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于深度学习的手术工具定位方法受限于标注数据的多样性，姿态标注在语义信息丰富度和标注效率之间取得了更好平衡，能够加速标注数据的增长

Method: 基于现有ROBUST-MIS数据集创建ROBUST-MIPS数据集，包含工具姿态和实例分割标注；使用流行的姿态估计方法建立基准测试；开发自定义工具姿态标注软件

Result: 观察到使用姿态标注进行手术工具定位能够获得高质量结果，证明了姿态标注方法的充分性

Conclusion: 姿态标注是手术工具定位的高效标注方法，新数据集和标注软件将促进该标注风格的采用，推动计算机辅助介入技术的发展

Abstract: Localisation of surgical tools constitutes a foundational building block for
computer-assisted interventional technologies. Works in this field typically
focus on training deep learning models to perform segmentation tasks.
Performance of learning-based approaches is limited by the availability of
diverse annotated data. We argue that skeletal pose annotations are a more
efficient annotation approach for surgical tools, striking a balance between
richness of semantic information and ease of annotation, thus allowing for
accelerated growth of available annotated data. To encourage adoption of this
annotation style, we present, ROBUST-MIPS, a combined tool pose and tool
instance segmentation dataset derived from the existing ROBUST-MIS dataset. Our
enriched dataset facilitates the joint study of these two annotation styles and
allow head-to-head comparison on various downstream tasks. To demonstrate the
adequacy of pose annotations for surgical tool localisation, we set up a simple
benchmark using popular pose estimation methods and observe high-quality
results. To ease adoption, together with the dataset, we release our benchmark
models and custom tool pose annotation software.

### [8] [Safe-Control: A Safety Patch for Mitigating Unsafe Content in Text-to-Image Generation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21099)
*Xiangtao Meng,Yingkai Dong,Ning Yu,Li Wang,Zheng Li,Shanqing Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Safe-Control是一种即插即用的安全补丁，用于减少文本到图像生成模型中的不安全内容生成，通过数据驱动策略和安全感知条件向锁定模型注入安全控制信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的T2I模型安全机制容易受到分布偏移的规避攻击，或者需要大量模型特定调整，需要一种更有效和灵活的安全解决方案。

Method: 使用数据驱动策略和安全感知条件，以补丁形式向锁定的T2I模型注入安全控制信号，支持构建多种安全补丁并灵活合并为统一补丁。

Result: 在6个不同的T2I模型上评估显示，Safe-Control将不安全内容生成概率降至7%，显著优于其他7种最先进的安全机制（约20%），同时保持良性图像质量和文本对齐。

Conclusion: Safe-Control提供了一种有效、灵活且兼容性强的安全机制，能够显著减少T2I模型的不安全内容生成，同时保持生成质量。

Abstract: Despite the advancements in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models, their
potential for misuse or even abuse raises serious safety concerns. Model
developers have made tremendous efforts to introduce safety mechanisms that can
address these concerns in T2I models. However, the existing safety mechanisms,
whether external or internal, either remain susceptible to evasion under
distribution shifts or require extensive model-specific adjustments. To address
these limitations, we introduce Safe-Control, an innovative plug-and-play
safety patch designed to mitigate unsafe content generation in T2I models.
Using data-driven strategies and safety-aware conditions, Safe-Control injects
safety control signals into the locked T2I model, acting as an update in a
patch-like manner. Model developers can also construct various safety patches
to meet the evolving safety requirements, which can be flexibly merged into a
single, unified patch. Its plug-and-play design further ensures adaptability,
making it compatible with other T2I models of similar denoising architecture.
We conduct extensive evaluations on six diverse and public T2I models.
Empirical results highlight that Safe-Control is effective in reducing unsafe
content generation across six diverse T2I models with similar generative
architectures, yet it successfully maintains the quality and text alignment of
benign images. Compared to seven state-of-the-art safety mechanisms, including
both external and internal defenses, Safe-Control significantly outperforms all
baselines in reducing unsafe content generation. For example, it reduces the
probability of unsafe content generation to 7%, compared to approximately 20%
for most baseline methods, under both unsafe prompts and the latest adversarial
attacks.

*Kei Katsumata,Yui Iioka,Naoki Hosomi,Teruhisa Misu,Kentaro Yamada,Komei Sugiura*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GENNAV是一个用于从自然语言指令和前置摄像头图像中识别目标区域位置的新方法，专门处理具有模糊边界的stuff-type目标区域，并在多目标和无目标情况下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理stuff-type目标区域（边界模糊）以及无目标或多目标情况时表现不佳，需要一种能够同时预测目标存在性和生成分割掩码的解决方案。

Method: 提出GENNAV方法，能够预测目标存在性并为多个stuff-type目标区域生成分割掩码。构建了GRiN-Drive基准数据集，包含无目标、单目标和多目标三种样本类型。

Result: GENNAV在标准评估指标上优于基线方法。在四个汽车、五个不同地理区域的真实世界实验中，展示了零样本迁移性能的优越性和跨环境的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GENNAV在目标区域识别任务中表现出色，特别是在处理stuff-type目标、多目标和无目标场景方面具有显著优势，并在真实世界环境中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: We focus on the task of identifying the location of target regions from a
natural language instruction and a front camera image captured by a mobility.
This task is challenging because it requires both existence prediction and
segmentation, particularly for stuff-type target regions with ambiguous
boundaries. Existing methods often underperform in handling stuff-type target
regions, in addition to absent or multiple targets. To overcome these
limitations, we propose GENNAV, which predicts target existence and generates
segmentation masks for multiple stuff-type target regions. To evaluate GENNAV,
we constructed a novel benchmark called GRiN-Drive, which includes three
distinct types of samples: no-target, single-target, and multi-target. GENNAV
achieved superior performance over baseline methods on standard evaluation
metrics. Furthermore, we conducted real-world experiments with four automobiles
operated in five geographically distinct urban areas to validate its zero-shot
transfer performance. In these experiments, GENNAV outperformed baseline
methods and demonstrated its robustness across diverse real-world environments.

### [10] [R-4B: Incentivizing General-Purpose Auto-Thinking Capability in MLLMs via Bi-Mode Annealing and Reinforce Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21113)
*Jie Jiang,Qi Yang,Bolin Ni,Shiming Xiang,Han Hu,Houwen Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: R-4B是一个自适应思维的多模态大语言模型，能够根据问题复杂度自动决定是否启动思维过程，在保持高性能的同时降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在处理简单问题时也会进行冗余的逐步思维过程，导致计算效率低下。需要一种能够自适应决定是否启动思维过程的模型。

Method: 采用双模式退火训练方法，使模型同时具备思维和非思维能力，并通过双模式策略优化(BPO)提高模型判断是否激活思维过程的准确性。训练分为两个阶段：首先在精心策划的数据集上训练，然后在改进的GRPO框架下进行策略优化。

Result: R-4B在25个具有挑战性的基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，在大多数任务中优于Qwen2.5-VL-7B，在推理密集型基准测试中与更大的模型(如Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506)性能相当，但计算成本更低。

Conclusion: R-4B通过自适应思维机制有效解决了多模态大语言模型在处理简单问题时的计算效率问题，在保持高性能的同时显著降低了计算开销，为高效多模态推理提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) equipped with step-by-step thinking
capabilities have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning
problems. However, this thinking process is redundant for simple problems
solvable without complex reasoning. To address this inefficiency, we propose
R-4B, an auto-thinking MLLM, which can adaptively decide when to think based on
problem complexity. The central idea of R-4B is to empower the model with both
thinking and non-thinking capabilities using bi-mode annealing, and apply
Bi-mode Policy Optimization~(BPO) to improve the model's accuracy in
determining whether to activate the thinking process. Specifically, we first
train the model on a carefully curated dataset spanning various topics, which
contains samples from both thinking and non-thinking modes. Then it undergoes a
second phase of training under an improved GRPO framework, where the policy
model is forced to generate responses from both modes for each input query.
Experimental results show that R-4B achieves state-of-the-art performance
across 25 challenging benchmarks. It outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-7B in most tasks
and achieves performance comparable to larger models such as
Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506 (16B) on reasoning-intensive benchmarks with lower
computational cost.

*Harris Song,Tuan-Anh Vu,Sanjith Menon,Sriram Narasimhan,M. Khalid Jawed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiddenObject是一个基于Mamba的多模态融合框架，整合RGB、热成像和深度数据，用于检测遮挡或伪装目标，在多个基准数据集上达到先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RGB检测方法在遮挡、伪装和光照变化等恶劣条件下性能受限，需要更鲁棒的模态无关方法来解决隐蔽物体检测的挑战。

Method: 提出Mamba-based融合机制，整合RGB、热成像和深度三种模态数据，捕获跨模态的互补信号，识别模态特定特征并在统一表示中进行融合。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上验证，相比现有方法达到state-of-the-art或竞争性性能，证明了融合设计的有效性。

Conclusion: Mamba-based融合架构能显著推进多模态目标检测领域发展，特别是在视觉退化或复杂条件下，暴露了当前单模态和简单融合策略的关键局限性。

Abstract: Detecting hidden or partially concealed objects remains a fundamental
challenge in multimodal environments, where factors like occlusion, camouflage,
and lighting variations significantly hinder performance. Traditional RGB-based
detection methods often fail under such adverse conditions, motivating the need
for more robust, modality-agnostic approaches. In this work, we present
HiddenObject, a fusion framework that integrates RGB, thermal, and depth data
using a Mamba-based fusion mechanism. Our method captures complementary signals
across modalities, enabling enhanced detection of obscured or camouflaged
targets. Specifically, the proposed approach identifies modality-specific
features and fuses them in a unified representation that generalizes well
across challenging scenarios. We validate HiddenObject across multiple
benchmark datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art or competitive performance
compared to existing methods. These results highlight the efficacy of our
fusion design and expose key limitations in current unimodal and na\"ive fusion
strategies. More broadly, our findings suggest that Mamba-based fusion
architectures can significantly advance the field of multimodal object
detection, especially under visually degraded or complex conditions.

*Ao Shen,Xueming Fu,Junfeng Jiang,Qiang Zeng,Ye Tang,Zhengming Chen,Luming Nong,Feng Wang,S. Kevin Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RadGS-Reg是一个新颖的框架，通过联合3D辐射高斯重建和3D/3D配准，实现了椎体级别的CT/X射线配准，在噪声X射线条件下表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统"渲染比较"方法存在空间信息丢失和域差距问题，而现有的双平面X射线3D重建方法受限于密集视图要求和噪声处理能力。

Method: 采用基于学习的辐射高斯重建方法，结合反事实注意力学习机制，专注于噪声X射线中的椎体区域，并使用患者特定的预训练策略从模拟数据逐步适应到真实数据。

Result: 在内部数据集上的实验显示，该方法在两个任务上都达到了最先进的性能，超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: RadGS-Reg框架有效解决了CT/X射线配准中的准确性和实时性挑战，特别是在噪声条件下的椎体配准方面表现出色。

Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT)/X-ray registration in image-guided navigation
remains challenging because of its stringent requirements for high accuracy and
real-time performance. Traditional "render and compare" methods, relying on
iterative projection and comparison, suffer from spatial information loss and
domain gap. 3D reconstruction from biplanar X-rays supplements spatial and
shape information for 2D/3D registration, but current methods are limited by
dense-view requirements and struggles with noisy X-rays. To address these
limitations, we introduce RadGS-Reg, a novel framework for vertebral-level
CT/X-ray registration through joint 3D Radiative Gaussians (RadGS)
reconstruction and 3D/3D registration. Specifically, our biplanar X-rays
vertebral RadGS reconstruction module explores learning-based RadGS
reconstruction method with a Counterfactual Attention Learning (CAL) mechanism,
focusing on vertebral regions in noisy X-rays. Additionally, a patient-specific
pre-training strategy progressively adapts the RadGS-Reg from simulated to real
data while simultaneously learning vertebral shape prior knowledge. Experiments
on in-house datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance for both
tasks, surpassing existing methods. The code is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SYNBUILD-3D是一个包含620万个合成3D住宅建筑的大规模多模态数据集，提供LoD 4级别的语义标注，支持3D建筑模型的自动生成研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏大规模标注的3D建筑数据集，自动生成准确且语义丰富的3D建筑模型面临重大挑战。受计算机视觉中合成数据成功的启发，需要创建大规模合成数据集来推动该领域发展。

Method: 创建SYNBUILD-3D数据集，包含620万个合成3D住宅建筑，每个建筑通过三种模态表示：LoD 4语义增强3D线框图、对应的平面图图像和LiDAR式屋顶点云。语义标注从平面图图像中提取，包含房间、门窗信息。

Conclusion: SYNBUILD-3D数据集为自动化创建LoD 4级别3D建筑模型提供了重要资源，能够支持在预定义平面布局和屋顶几何条件下保持语义-几何一致性的生成算法开发。

Abstract: 3D building models are critical for applications in architecture, energy
simulation, and navigation. Yet, generating accurate and semantically rich 3D
buildings automatically remains a major challenge due to the lack of
large-scale annotated datasets in the public domain. Inspired by the success of
synthetic data in computer vision, we introduce SYNBUILD-3D, a large, diverse,
and multi-modal dataset of over 6.2 million synthetic 3D residential buildings
at Level of Detail (LoD) 4. In the dataset, each building is represented
through three distinct modalities: a semantically enriched 3D wireframe graph
at LoD 4 (Modality I), the corresponding floor plan images (Modality II), and a
LiDAR-like roof point cloud (Modality III). The semantic annotations for each

*Mårten Wadenbäck,Marcus Valtonen Örnhag,Johan Edstedt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一的方法来同时估计单应性变换和径向畸变，解决了三种不同配置的径向畸变问题，并开发了快速、稳定、准确的最小求解器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在真实图像处理中，相机镜头引起的几何畸变（特别是径向畸变）会影响单应性估计的准确性。现有方法分别处理三种不同的径向畸变配置，缺乏统一的解决方案。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的统一方法，能够同时处理三种径向畸变配置：单图像畸变、两图像相同畸变和两图像独立畸变。基于该方法构建了新的最小求解器。

Result: 在所有三种情况下，提出的求解器比现有最先进求解器更快，同时保持相似的准确性。在包括鱼眼相机图像在内的标准基准测试中表现良好。

Conclusion: 该方法为径向畸变单应性估计提供了一个统一的框架，所开发的求解器在速度和准确性方面都优于现有方法，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Homographies are among the most prevalent transformations occurring in
geometric computer vision and projective geometry, and homography estimation is
consequently a crucial step in a wide assortment of computer vision tasks. When
working with real images, which are often afflicted with geometric distortions
caused by the camera lens, it may be necessary to determine both the homography
and the lens distortion-particularly the radial component, called radial
distortion-simultaneously to obtain anything resembling useful estimates. When
considering a homography with radial distortion between two images, there are
three conceptually distinct configurations for the radial distortion; (i)
distortion in only one image, (ii) identical distortion in the two images, and
(iii) independent distortion in the two images. While these cases have been
addressed separately in the past, the present paper provides a novel and
unified approach to solve all three cases. We demonstrate how the proposed
approach can be used to construct new fast, stable, and accurate minimal
solvers for radially distorted homographies. In all three cases, our proposed
solvers are faster than the existing state-of-the-art solvers while maintaining
similar accuracy. The solvers are tested on well-established benchmarks
including images taken with fisheye cameras. The source code for our solvers
will be made available in the event our paper is accepted for publication.

*Zhenghao He,Sanchit Sinha,Guangzhi Xiong,Aidong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了全局概念激活向量(GCAV)框架，通过对比学习和注意力融合机制统一不同层的CAV表示，解决了跨层概念不一致性问题，提高了概念归因的稳定性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CAV在不同层独立计算时存在概念表示不一致的问题，导致跨层比较不可靠，需要一种统一的方法来确保概念语义的一致性。

Method: 使用对比学习对齐跨层概念表示，采用基于注意力的融合机制构建全局集成的CAV，并提出了TGCAV方法来评估GCAV表示。

Result: 实验表明GCAV显著降低了TCAV分数的方差，保持了概念相关性，有效缓解了跨层概念不一致性，增强了概念定位能力，并提高了对抗扰动的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GCAV通过整合跨层信息提供了一个更全面、可解释的框架，有助于理解深度学习模型如何编码人类定义的概念。

Abstract: Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) provide a powerful approach for
interpreting deep neural networks by quantifying their sensitivity to
human-defined concepts. However, when computed independently at different
layers, CAVs often exhibit inconsistencies, making cross-layer comparisons
unreliable. To address this issue, we propose the Global Concept Activation
Vector (GCAV), a novel framework that unifies CAVs into a single, semantically
consistent representation. Our method leverages contrastive learning to align
concept representations across layers and employs an attention-based fusion
mechanism to construct a globally integrated CAV. By doing so, our method
significantly reduces the variance in TCAV scores while preserving concept
relevance, ensuring more stable and reliable concept attributions. To evaluate
the effectiveness of GCAV, we introduce Testing with Global Concept Activation
Vectors (TGCAV) as a method to apply TCAV to GCAV-based representations. We
conduct extensive experiments on multiple deep neural networks, demonstrating
that our method effectively mitigates concept inconsistency across layers,
enhances concept localization, and improves robustness against adversarial
perturbations. By integrating cross-layer information into a coherent
framework, our method offers a more comprehensive and interpretable
understanding of how deep learning models encode human-defined concepts. Code

*Zhizhong Huang,Xiaoming Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VICP是一个新颖的视觉上下文提示框架，通过在已见类别上训练的模型，仅使用上下文示例作为提示，无需参数调整即可直接泛化到未见的新类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前ReID方法需要针对特定领域训练模型，缺乏泛化能力且需要大量标注数据。自监督学习虽然减少标注需求，但难以捕捉对ReID至关重要的身份敏感特征。

Method: 结合LLM和视觉基础模型：LLM通过任务特定提示从少量正负样本对推断语义身份规则，然后指导VFM通过动态视觉提示提取身份判别特征。

Result: 在ShopID10K数据集和多个ReID基准测试中，VICP在未见类别上的表现明显优于基线方法。

Conclusion: VICP通过将LLM衍生的语义概念与VFM的预训练先验对齐，实现了对新类别的泛化，无需数据集特定的重新训练。

Abstract: Current object re-identification (ReID) methods train domain-specific models
(e.g., for persons or vehicles), which lack generalization and demand costly
labeled data for new categories. While self-supervised learning reduces
annotation needs by learning instance-wise invariance, it struggles to capture
\textit{identity-sensitive} features critical for ReID. This paper proposes
Visual In-Context Prompting~(VICP), a novel framework where models trained on
seen categories can directly generalize to unseen novel categories using only
\textit{in-context examples} as prompts, without requiring parameter
adaptation. VICP synergizes LLMs and vision foundation models~(VFM): LLMs infer
semantic identity rules from few-shot positive/negative pairs through
task-specific prompting, which then guides a VFM (\eg, DINO) to extract
ID-discriminative features via \textit{dynamic visual prompts}. By aligning
LLM-derived semantic concepts with the VFM's pre-trained prior, VICP enables
generalization to novel categories, eliminating the need for dataset-specific
retraining. To support evaluation, we introduce ShopID10K, a dataset of 10K
object instances from e-commerce platforms, featuring multi-view images and
cross-domain testing. Experiments on ShopID10K and diverse ReID benchmarks
demonstrate that VICP outperforms baselines by a clear margin on unseen
categories. Code is available at https://github.com/Hzzone/VICP.

TL;DR: 本研究使用SegResNet模型在PANTHER挑战赛的两个MRI胰腺肿瘤分割任务上进行评估，结果显示T1加权MRI任务表现较好（DSC 0.56），T2加权MRI-Linac任务性能下降（DSC 0.33），凸显了小数据集下不同MRI序列对分割效果的显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺肿瘤的精确分割对诊断和治疗规划至关重要，但由于解剖结构变异性和数据集有限，自动化分割仍然具有挑战性。本研究旨在评估SegResNet模型在不同MRI序列上的胰腺肿瘤分割性能。

Method: 采用SegResNet模型（Auto3DSeg架构），通过5折交叉验证和STAPLE集成方法，在解剖相关感兴趣区域进行训练。使用91例T1加权动脉对比增强MRI（任务1）和50例T2加权MR-Linac病例（任务2），均带有专家标注的胰腺和肿瘤标签。

Result: 任务1（T1加权MRI）获得DSC 0.56、5mm DSC 0.73、HD95 41.1mm、MASD 26.0mm、RMSE 5164mm；任务2（T2加权MR-Linac）性能下降，DSC 0.33、5mm DSC 0.50、HD95 20.1mm、MASD 7.2mm、RMSE 17203mm。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明小数据集下MRI胰腺肿瘤分割面临挑战，不同MRI序列引入显著变异性。尽管性能一般，但展示了自动化分割的潜力，强调需要更大、标准化的MRI数据集来提高模型鲁棒性和临床实用性。

Abstract: Accurate delineation of pancreatic tumors is critical for diagnosis,
treatment planning, and outcome assessment, yet automated segmentation remains
challenging due to anatomical variability and limited dataset availability. In
this study, SegResNet models, as part of the Auto3DSeg architecture, were
trained and evaluated on two MRI-based pancreatic tumor segmentation tasks as
part of the 2025 PANTHER Challenge. Algorithm methodology included 5-fold
cross-validation with STAPLE ensembling after focusing on an anatomically
relevant region-of-interest. The Pancreatic Tumor Segmentation on Diagnostic
MRI task 1 training set included 91 T1-weighted arterial contrast-enhanced MRI
with expert annotated pancreas and tumor labels. The Pancreatic Tumor
Segmentation on MR-Linac task 2 training set used 50 T2-weighted MR-Linac cases
with expert annotated pancreas and tumor labels. Algorithm-automated
segmentation performance of pancreatic tumor was assessed using Dice Similarity
Coefficient (DSC), 5 mm DSC, 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95), Mean
Average Surface Distance (MASD), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). For Task 1,
the algorithm achieved a DSC of 0.56, 5 mm DSC of 0.73, HD95 of 41.1 mm, MASD
of 26.0 mm, and RMSE of 5164 mm. For Task 2, performance decreased, with a DSC
of 0.33, 5 mm DSC of 0.50, HD95 of 20.1 mm, MASD of 7.2 mm, and RMSE of 17,203
mm. These findings illustrate the challenges of MRI-based pancreatic tumor
segmentation with small datasets, highlighting variability introduced by
different MRI sequences. Despite modest performance, the results demonstrate
potential for automated delineation and emphasize the need for larger,
standardized MRI datasets to improve model robustness and clinical utility.

*Yidong Zhao,Peter Kellman,Hui Xue,Tongyun Yang,Yi Zhang,Yuchi Han,Orlando Simonetti,Qian Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Reverse Imaging是一种基于物理原理的心脏MRI数据增强方法，通过逆向推断底层自旋属性来解决不同成像序列间的泛化问题，显著提升分割模型的跨域性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练的心脏MRI分割模型在不同成像序列间泛化能力差，主要原因是图像对比度的显著差异。虽然成像协议不同，但所有图像都由相同的基本自旋属性（质子密度、T1、T2值）决定。

Method: 提出Reverse Imaging方法：1）通过解决非线性逆问题从观测图像逆向推断底层自旋属性；2）使用扩散模型学习mSASHA数据集的自旋属性先验分布；3）基于推断的自旋属性合成任意新序列的图像。

Result: 该方法能够从MR图像获得有意义的自旋属性估计，作为可解释的潜在变量，实现高度灵活的图像合成。实验表明Reverse Imaging能够在完全不同图像对比度和成像协议下实现高精度分割。

Conclusion: Reverse Imaging通过物理驱动的方法从根本上解决了心脏MRI分割的泛化问题，实现了宽谱泛化能力，为医学图像分析提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Pretrained segmentation models for cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
struggle to generalize across different imaging sequences due to significant
variations in image contrast. These variations arise from changes in imaging
protocols, yet the same fundamental spin properties, including proton density,
T1, and T2 values, govern all acquired images. With this core principle, we
introduce Reverse Imaging, a novel physics-driven method for cardiac MRI data
augmentation and domain adaptation to fundamentally solve the generalization
problem. Our method reversely infers the underlying spin properties from
observed cardiac MRI images, by solving ill-posed nonlinear inverse problems
regularized by the prior distribution of spin properties. We acquire this "spin
prior" by learning a generative diffusion model from the multiparametric
SAturation-recovery single-SHot acquisition sequence (mSASHA) dataset, which
offers joint cardiac T1 and T2 maps. Our method enables approximate but
meaningful spin-property estimates from MR images, which provide an
interpretable "latent variable" that lead to highly flexible image synthesis of
arbitrary novel sequences. We show that Reverse Imaging enables highly accurate
segmentation across vastly different image contrasts and imaging protocols,
realizing wide-spectrum generalization of cardiac MRI segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PHD是一种新颖的个性化3D人体网格恢复方法，通过用户特定形状信息来提高视频姿态估计精度，使用点扩散变换器作为形状条件3D姿态先验，显著提升姿态准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HMR方法为了泛化性而设计为用户无关，通过2D图像约束优化姿态但牺牲了3D精度，无法同时考虑个性化身体形状和3D姿态合理性。

Method: 首先校准用户身体形状，然后基于该形状进行个性化姿态拟合，开发了身体形状条件3D姿态先验（Point Diffusion Transformer），通过点蒸馏采样损失迭代指导姿态拟合。

Result: 不仅提高了骨盆对齐姿态精度，还提升了绝对姿态精度，仅需合成数据训练，可作为即插即用模块与现有3D姿态估计器集成。

Conclusion: PHD方法有效解决了传统方法过度依赖2D约束的问题，通过个性化形状校准和条件姿态先验显著提升了3D人体姿态恢复的准确性。

Abstract: We introduce PHD, a novel approach for personalized 3D human mesh recovery
(HMR) and body fitting that leverages user-specific shape information to
improve pose estimation accuracy from videos. Traditional HMR methods are
designed to be user-agnostic and optimized for generalization. While these
methods often refine poses using constraints derived from the 2D image to
improve alignment, this process compromises 3D accuracy by failing to jointly
account for person-specific body shapes and the plausibility of 3D poses. In
contrast, our pipeline decouples this process by first calibrating the user's
body shape and then employing a personalized pose fitting process conditioned
on that shape. To achieve this, we develop a body shape-conditioned 3D pose
prior, implemented as a Point Diffusion Transformer, which iteratively guides
the pose fitting via a Point Distillation Sampling loss. This learned 3D pose
prior effectively mitigates errors arising from an over-reliance on 2D
constraints. Consequently, our approach improves not only pelvis-aligned pose
accuracy but also absolute pose accuracy -- an important metric often
overlooked by prior work. Furthermore, our method is highly data-efficient,
requiring only synthetic data for training, and serves as a versatile
plug-and-play module that can be seamlessly integrated with existing 3D pose
estimators to enhance their performance. Project page:

Conclusion: 该案案通过多级剪枝策略有效解决了深度学习模型在3D人体姿估计中的计算效率问题，在保持性能的同时显著提升了计算效率

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong capabilities in generating
high-fidelity 3D human poses, yet their iterative nature and multi-hypothesis
requirements incur substantial computational cost. In this paper, we propose an
Efficient Diffusion-Based 3D Human Pose Estimation framework with a
Hierarchical Temporal Pruning (HTP) strategy, which dynamically prunes
redundant pose tokens across both frame and semantic levels while preserving
critical motion dynamics. HTP operates in a staged, top-down manner: (1)
Temporal Correlation-Enhanced Pruning (TCEP) identifies essential frames by
analyzing inter-frame motion correlations through adaptive temporal graph
construction; (2) Sparse-Focused Temporal MHSA (SFT MHSA) leverages the
resulting frame-level sparsity to reduce attention computation, focusing on
motion-relevant tokens; and (3) Mask-Guided Pose Token Pruner (MGPTP) performs
fine-grained semantic pruning via clustering, retaining only the most
informative pose tokens. Experiments on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP show that
HTP reduces training MACs by 38.5\%, inference MACs by 56.8\%, and improves
inference speed by an average of 81.1\% compared to prior diffusion-based
methods, while achieving state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OCT技术能获取高分辨率3D指纹数据，但数据采集成本高、耗时长，导致大规模公开数据集稀缺，限制了深度学习模型的发展。

Method: 三阶段框架：1）2D风格转换模块将二值指纹转为灰度图像；2）3D结构扩展网络将2D图像外推为3D解剖体积；3）基于3D GAN的OCT真实感细化器添加纹理和噪声特征。

Result: 生成了42万个合成样本的大规模数据集，通过在合成数据上预训练并在小规模真实数据上微调，将ZJUT-EIFD基准的等错误率从15.62%降至2.50%。

Conclusion: Print2Volume框架有效解决了OCT指纹数据稀缺问题，生成的合成数据质量高，能显著提升指纹识别性能，为数据驱动算法发展提供了重要支持。

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) enables the acquisition of
high-resolution, three-dimensional fingerprint data, capturing rich subsurface
structures for robust biometric recognition. However, the high cost and
time-consuming nature of OCT data acquisition have led to a scarcity of
large-scale public datasets, significantly hindering the development of
advanced algorithms, particularly data-hungry deep learning models. To address
this critical bottleneck, this paper introduces Print2Volume, a novel framework
for generating realistic, synthetic OCT-based 3D fingerprints from 2D
fingerprint image. Our framework operates in three sequential stages: (1) a 2D
style transfer module that converts a binary fingerprint into a grayscale
images mimicking the style of a Z-direction mean-projected OCT scan; (2) a 3D
Structure Expansion Network that extrapolates the 2D im-age into a plausible 3D
anatomical volume; and (3) an OCT Realism Refiner, based on a 3D GAN, that
renders the structural volume with authentic textures, speckle noise, and other
imaging characteristics. Using Print2Volume, we generated a large-scale
synthetic dataset of 420,000 samples. Quantitative experiments demonstrate the
high quality of our synthetic data and its significant impact on recognition
performance. By pre-training a recognition model on our synthetic data and
fine-tuning it on a small real-world dataset, we achieved a remarkable
reduction in the Equal Error Rate (EER) from 15.62% to 2.50% on the ZJUT-EIFD
benchmark, proving the effectiveness of our approach in overcoming data
scarcity.

Conclusion: GLENDA数据集的发布填补了医学图像数据空白，将促进手术视频自动分析技术的发展，有助于治疗规划、病例记录和教育等术后活动

Abstract: Gynecologic laparoscopy as a type of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is
performed via a live feed of a patient's abdomen surveying the insertion and
handling of various instruments for conducting treatment. Adopting this kind of
surgical intervention not only facilitates a great variety of treatments, the
possibility of recording said video streams is as well essential for numerous
post-surgical activities, such as treatment planning, case documentation and
education. Nonetheless, the process of manually analyzing surgical recordings,
as it is carried out in current practice, usually proves tediously
time-consuming. In order to improve upon this situation, more sophisticated
computer vision as well as machine learning approaches are actively developed.
Since most of such approaches heavily rely on sample data, which especially in
the medical field is only sparsely available, with this work we publish the
Gynecologic Laparoscopy ENdometriosis DAtaset (GLENDA) - an image dataset
containing region-based annotations of a common medical condition named
endometriosis, i.e. the dislocation of uterine-like tissue. The dataset is the
first of its kind and it has been created in collaboration with leading medical
experts in the field.

Motivation: 手术视频记录已成为医学内窥镜领域的重要信息源，但自动内容索引（基于内容的视频档案搜索基础）由于特殊的视频内容而面临巨大挑战。

Method: 使用区域全卷积网络进行实例感知的（1）器械分割（区分器械或背景）和（2）器械识别（识别器械类型）。

Result: 即使训练样本数量适中，也能以较高准确率定位和分割器械区域；但确定具体器械类型仍然非常困难，因为手术器械具有固有的高度相似性。

Conclusion: 手术器械分割技术已经相对成熟，但器械类型识别仍需进一步研究改进，主要挑战在于手术器械之间的高度相似性。

Abstract: Recorded videos from surgeries have become an increasingly important
information source for the field of medical endoscopy, since the recorded
footage shows every single detail of the surgery. However, while video
recording is straightforward these days, automatic content indexing - the basis
for content-based search in a medical video archive - is still a great
challenge due to the very special video content. In this work, we investigate
segmentation and recognition of surgical instruments in videos recorded from
laparoscopic gynecology. More precisely, we evaluate the achievable performance
of segmenting surgical instruments from their background by using a
region-based fully convolutional network for instance-aware (1) instrument
segmentation as well as (2) instrument recognition. While the first part
addresses only binary segmentation of instances (i.e., distinguishing between
instrument or background) we also investigate multi-class instrument
recognition (i.e., identifying the type of instrument). Our evaluation results
show that even with a moderately low number of training examples, we are able
to localize and segment instrument regions with a pretty high accuracy.
However, the results also reveal that determining the particular instrument is
still very challenging, due to the inherently high similarity of surgical
instruments.

Abstract: A Whole Slide Image (WSI) is a high-resolution digital image created by
scanning an entire glass slide containing a biological specimen, such as tissue
sections or cell samples, at multiple magnifications. These images can be
viewed, analyzed, shared digitally, and are used today for Artificial
Intelligence (AI) algorithm development. WSIs are used in a variety of fields,
including pathology for diagnosing diseases and oncology for cancer research.
They are also utilized in neurology, veterinary medicine, hematology,
microbiology, dermatology, pharmacology, toxicology, immunology, and forensic
science.
  When assembling cohorts for the training or validation of an AI algorithm, it
is essential to know what is present on such a WSI. However, there is currently
no standard for this metadata, so such selection has mainly been done through
manual inspection, which is not suitable for large collections with several
million objects.
  We propose a general framework to generate a 2D index map for WSI and a
profiling mechanism for specific application domains. We demonstrate this
approach in the field of clinical pathology, using common syntax and semantics
to achieve interoperability between different catalogs.
  Our approach augments each WSI collection with a detailed tissue map that
provides fine-grained information about the WSI content. The tissue map is
organized into three layers: source, tissue type, and pathological alterations,
with each layer assigning segments of the WSI to specific classes.
  We illustrate the advantages and applicability of the proposed standard
through specific examples in WSI catalogs, Machine Learning (ML), and
graph-based WSI representations.

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many
computer vision tasks. However, in real-world scenarios, novel classes that
were unseen during training often emerge, requiring models to acquire new
knowledge incrementally. Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) methods enable a
model to learn novel classes while retaining knowledge of previous classes.
However, these methods make the strong assumption that the incremental dataset
is fully labeled, which is unrealistic in practice. In this work, we propose an
unsupervised Incremental Learning method using Confidence-based Pseudo-labels
(ICPL), which replaces human annotations with pseudo-labels, enabling
incremental learning from unlabeled datasets. We integrate these pseudo-labels
into various CIL methods with confidence-based selection and evaluate
performance degradation on CIFAR100 and ImageNet100. Then, we compare our
approach to popular Class Incremental Novel Category Discovery (class-iNCD)
methods addressing similar challenges. Additionally, we apply our method to
fine-grained datasets to demonstrate its real-world practicality and measure
its computational complexity to validate its suitability for
resource-constrained environments. ICPL achieves competitive results compared
to supervised methods and outperforms state-of-the-art class-iNCD methods by
more than 5% in final accuracy.

TL;DR: MedShift是一个基于Flow Matching和Schrodinger Bridges的统一类别条件生成模型，用于在合成和真实X射线图像之间进行高质量的无配对跨域转换，解决了医学成像中的领域适应问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合成医学数据虽然可扩展，但与真实临床设置存在显著领域差距，限制了模型的泛化能力。需要解决合成和真实X射线图像在衰减行为、噪声特性和软组织表示方面的差异。

Method: 提出MedShift模型，基于Flow Matching和Schrodinger Bridges构建统一的类别条件生成模型。学习共享的领域无关潜在空间，支持训练期间见过的任意域对之间的无缝转换，无需领域特定训练或配对数据。

Result: 实验结果表明，MedShift在较小模型尺寸下仍能提供强大性能，推理时灵活可调，可以优先考虑感知保真度或结构一致性。在X-DigiSkull新数据集上验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: MedShift为医学成像中的领域适应提供了一个可扩展和可泛化的解决方案，代码和数据集已公开。

Abstract: Synthetic medical data offers a scalable solution for training robust models,
but significant domain gaps limit its generalizability to real-world clinical
settings. This paper addresses the challenge of cross-domain translation
between synthetic and real X-ray images of the head, focusing on bridging
discrepancies in attenuation behavior, noise characteristics, and soft tissue
representation. We propose MedShift, a unified class-conditional generative
model based on Flow Matching and Schrodinger Bridges, which enables
high-fidelity, unpaired image translation across multiple domains. Unlike prior
approaches that require domain-specific training or rely on paired data,
MedShift learns a shared domain-agnostic latent space and supports seamless
translation between any pair of domains seen during training. We introduce
X-DigiSkull, a new dataset comprising aligned synthetic and real skull X-rays
under varying radiation doses, to benchmark domain translation models.
Experimental results demonstrate that, despite its smaller model size compared
to diffusion-based approaches, MedShift offers strong performance and remains
flexible at inference time, as it can be tuned to prioritize either perceptual
fidelity or structural consistency, making it a scalable and generalizable
solution for domain adaptation in medical imaging. The code and dataset are

Motivation: 现有全球产品主要关注二元树冠覆盖或冠层高度，无法在个体水平识别树木，大尺度单木监测存在建模不足的问题。

Method: 使用3米分辨率PlanetScope影像，采用高斯核模拟可扩展大小的树冠，从机载激光雷达数据自动提取数十亿个点进行训练，建立深度学习模型检测单木。

Abstract: Trees are key components of the terrestrial biosphere, playing vital roles in
ecosystem function, climate regulation, and the bioeconomy. However,
large-scale monitoring of individual trees remains limited by inadequate
modelling. Available global products have focused on binary tree cover or
canopy height, which do not explicitely identify trees at individual level. In
this study, we present a deep learning approach for detecting large individual
trees in 3-m resolution PlanetScope imagery at a global scale. We simulate tree
crowns with Gaussian kernels of scalable size, allowing the extraction of crown
centers and the generation of binary tree cover maps. Training is based on
billions of points automatically extracted from airborne lidar data, enabling
the model to successfully identify trees both inside and outside forests. We
compare against existing tree cover maps and airborne lidar with
state-of-the-art performance (fractional cover R$^2 = 0.81$ against aerial
lidar), report balanced detection metrics across biomes, and demonstrate how
detection can be further improved through fine-tuning with manual labels. Our
method offers a scalable framework for global, high-resolution tree monitoring,
and is adaptable to future satellite missions offering improved imagery.

Conclusion: 该框架为动态场景的高斯泼溅提供了一种高效可扩展的解决方案，在保持高质量渲染的同时大幅提升训练效率。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables high-fidelity real-time rendering, a key
requirement for immersive applications. However, the extension of 3DGS to
dynamic scenes remains limitations on the substantial data volume of dense
Gaussians and the prolonged training time required for each frame. This paper
presents \M, a scalable Gaussian Splatting framework designed for efficient
training in streaming tasks. Specifically, Gaussian spheres are hierarchically
organized by scale within an anchor-based structure. Coarser-level Gaussians
represent the low-resolution structure of the scene, while finer-level
Gaussians, responsible for detailed high-fidelity rendering, are selectively
activated by the coarser-level Gaussians. To further reduce computational
overhead, we introduce a hybrid deformation and spawning strategy that models
motion of inter-frame through Gaussian deformation and triggers Gaussian
spawning to characterize wide-range motion. Additionally, a bidirectional
adaptive masking mechanism enhances training efficiency by removing static
regions and prioritizing informative viewpoints. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that \M~ achieves superior visual quality while significantly
reducing training time compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型计算需求高，难以在本地设备部署。需要开发轻量级但性能相当的图像描述模型，以满足视频指令系统和探索机器人等应用的需求。

Method: 首先基于125M参数语言模型实现轻量级专家模型，然后在发现视觉盲区问题后，开发了Sharp-Eyed Refinement框架，使用DeepLens模块提取详细视觉表征，专注于信息丰富的区域。

Conclusion: 研究表明小参数量的视觉专家模型具有在设备端应用的潜力，同时提出的改进框架能够有效解决多模态模型中的视觉注意力机制和表征限制问题。

Abstract: Image captioning is fundamental for applications like video instruction
systems and exploration robots, yet deploying such models on local devices is
challenging due to the high computational demands of multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). To address this, we first explore lightweight captioning by
implementing a specialist based on a 125M-parameter language model, 56 times
smaller than LLaMA-7B, and evaluating its performance on both single-sentence
and detailed captioning tasks. Surprisingly, we find that our model can achieve
performance comparable to large multimodal generalists, suggesting its
potential to serve as a strong visual specialist for on-device applications.
While promising, our model also exhibits a limitation: like other MLLMs, it
suffers from visual blindness, occasionally resulting in semantic captioning
errors. We carry out toy experiments and investigate the underlying causes,
where we observe that the problems arise from ineffective attention mechanisms
and limited visual representations. To alleviate them, we develop a novel
captioning framework, Sharp-Eyed Refinement, which enhances caption quality
through improved visual grounding. At its core, our DeepLens extracts detailed
visual representations by concentrating on informative regions identified
during the initial glance. Our experiments confirm both the advantages of our
specialist over prior small captioning models and large generalists and the
effectiveness of our framework.

Abstract: While foundation models (FMs) offer strong potential for AI-based dementia
diagnosis, their integration into federated learning (FL) systems remains
underexplored. In this benchmarking study, we systematically evaluate the
impact of key design choices: classification head architecture, fine-tuning
strategy, and aggregation method, on the performance and efficiency of
federated FM tuning using brain MRI data. Using a large multi-cohort dataset,
we find that the architecture of the classification head substantially
influences performance, freezing the FM encoder achieves comparable results to
full fine-tuning, and advanced aggregation methods outperform standard
federated averaging. Our results offer practical insights for deploying FMs in
decentralized clinical settings and highlight trade-offs that should guide
future method development.

TL;DR: 提出Multi-Method Ensemble (MME)评分方法，通过结合特征截断和多种评分函数来提升OOD检测性能，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OOD检测方法通常只关注单一技术（特征截断或评分函数）或在特定类型OOD数据集上评估，忽视了组合多种现有解决方案的潜力。

Method: 提出MME评分方法，统一结合最先进的特征截断技术和多种评分函数，通过集成多个评分函数来增强对不同类型OOD样本的鲁棒性。

Result: 在大型和小型基准测试（包括近OOD和远OOD场景）上，MME显著优于现有方法。使用BiT模型在ImageNet-1K基准上达到平均FPR95为27.57%，比最佳基线提升6%。

Conclusion: 理论分析和实验证明，通过有效结合特征截断和多种评分函数可以显著提升OOD检测性能，MME方法为开放世界环境下的神经网络安全部署提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is essential for neural networks
operating in open-world settings, particularly in safety-critical applications.
Existing methods have improved OOD detection by leveraging two main techniques:
feature truncation, which increases the separation between in-distribution (ID)
and OOD samples, and scoring functions, which assign scores to distinguish
between ID and OOD data. However, most approaches either focus on a single
family of techniques or evaluate their effectiveness on a specific type of OOD
dataset, overlooking the potential of combining multiple existing solutions.
Motivated by this observation, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate
that state-of-the-art feature truncation and scoring functions can be
effectively combined. Moreover, we show that aggregating multiple scoring
functions enhances robustness against various types of OOD samples. Based on
these insights, we propose the Multi-Method Ensemble (MME) score, which unifies
state-of-the-art OOD detectors into a single, more effective scoring function.
Extensive experiments on both large-scale and small-scale benchmarks, covering
near-OOD and far-OOD scenarios, show that MME significantly outperforms recent
state-of-the-art methods across all benchmarks. Notably, using the BiT model,
our method achieves an average FPR95 of 27.57% on the challenging ImageNet-1K
benchmark, improving performance by 6% over the best existing baseline.

Conclusion: 局部增强方法通过减少背景干扰，能够更有效地提升对抗补丁攻击的效果，为船舶检测系统的安全性提供了改进方案。

Abstract: Current ship detection techniques based on remote sensing imagery primarily
rely on the object detection capabilities of deep neural networks (DNNs).
However, DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks, which can lead to
misclassification by the detection model or complete evasion of the targets.
Numerous studies have demonstrated that data transformation-based methods can
improve the transferability of adversarial examples. However, excessive
augmentation of image backgrounds or irrelevant regions may introduce
unnecessary interference, resulting in false detections of the object detection
model. These errors are not caused by the adversarial patches themselves but
rather by the over-augmentation of background and non-target areas. This paper
proposes a localized augmentation method that applies augmentation only to the
target regions, avoiding any influence on non-target areas. By reducing
background interference, this approach enables the loss function to focus more
directly on the impact of the adversarial patch on the detection model, thereby
improving the attack success rate. Experiments conducted on the HRSC2016
dataset demonstrate that the proposed method effectively increases the success
rate of adversarial patch attacks and enhances their transferability.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了首个专门针对长视频幻觉的基准ELV-Halluc，系统研究了语义聚合幻觉(SAH)现象，发现SAH随语义复杂度增加而加剧，并提出了位置编码策略和DPO训练方法来缓解SAH问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频多模态大语言模型在视频理解方面取得显著进展，但仍容易产生与视频输入不一致或无关的幻觉内容。现有基准主要关注短视频，忽略了长视频中由于语义复杂度增加而产生的语义聚合幻觉问题。

Method: 引入ELV-Halluc基准系统研究SAH；通过实验验证SAH存在并分析其特性；探讨位置编码策略和采用DPO（直接偏好优化）策略来增强模型区分事件内和事件间语义的能力；构建包含8K对抗数据对的数据集。

Result: 实验证实了SAH的存在，显示SAH随语义复杂度增加而增加；模型在快速变化的语义上更容易产生SAH；位置编码策略有助于缓解SAH；DPO策略在ELV-Halluc和Video-MME基准上都取得了改进，SAH比率大幅降低了27.7%。

Conclusion: 长视频中的语义聚合幻觉是一个重要但被忽视的问题，需要专门的基准和方法来解决。提出的位置编码和DPO策略能有效缓解SAH，为改善视频多模态大语言模型的幻觉问题提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Video multimodal large language models (Video-MLLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in video understanding. However, they remain vulnerable to
hallucination-producing content inconsistent with or unrelated to video inputs.
Previous video hallucination benchmarks primarily focus on short-videos. They
attribute hallucinations to factors such as strong language priors, missing
frames, or vision-language biases introduced by the visual encoder. While these
causes indeed account for most hallucinations in short videos, they still
oversimplify the cause of hallucinations. Sometimes, models generate incorrect
outputs but with correct frame-level semantics. We refer to this type of
hallucination as Semantic Aggregation Hallucination (SAH), which arises during
the process of aggregating frame-level semantics into event-level semantic
groups. Given that SAH becomes particularly critical in long videos due to
increased semantic complexity across multiple events, it is essential to
separate and thoroughly investigate the causes of this type of hallucination.
To address the above issues, we introduce ELV-Halluc, the first benchmark
dedicated to long-video hallucination, enabling a systematic investigation of
SAH. Our experiments confirm the existence of SAH and show that it increases
with semantic complexity. Additionally, we find that models are more prone to
SAH on rapidly changing semantics. Moreover, we discuss potential approaches to
mitigate SAH. We demonstrate that positional encoding strategy contributes to
alleviating SAH, and further adopt DPO strategy to enhance the model's ability
to distinguish semantics within and across events. To support this, we curate a
dataset of 8K adversarial data pairs and achieve improvements on both
ELV-Halluc and Video-MME, including a substantial 27.7% reduction in SAH ratio.

Method: 训练卷积神经网络，参考输入图像对低分辨率（大补丁尺寸）基础模型特征进行上采样，无需额外训练即可应用于各种显微镜图像的特征提取和分割

Conclusion: 该方法为显微镜图像分析提供了一种高效的特征上采样解决方案，显著提升了分割质量并减少了人工标注需求

Abstract: Feature foundation models - usually vision transformers - offer rich semantic
descriptors of images, useful for downstream tasks such as (interactive)
segmentation and object detection. For computational efficiency these
descriptors are often patch-based, and so struggle to represent the fine
features often present in micrographs; they also struggle with the large image
sizes present in materials and biological image analysis. In this work, we
train a convolutional neural network to upsample low-resolution (i.e, large
patch size) foundation model features with reference to the input image. We
apply this upsampler network (without any further training) to efficiently
featurise and then segment a variety of microscopy images, including plant
cells, a lithium-ion battery cathode and organic crystals. The richness of
these upsampled features admits separation of hard to segment phases, like
hairline cracks. We demonstrate that interactive segmentation with these deep
features produces high-quality segmentations far faster and with far fewer
labels than training or finetuning a more traditional convolutional network.

Conclusion: HCCM框架有效解决了无人机场景中的视觉语言理解挑战，具有优秀的零样本泛化能力和最先进的性能表现。

Abstract: Natural Language-Guided Drones (NLGD) provide a novel paradigm for tasks such
as target matching and navigation. However, the wide field of view and complex
compositional semantics in drone scenarios pose challenges for vision-language
understanding. Mainstream Vision-Language Models (VLMs) emphasize global
alignment while lacking fine-grained semantics, and existing hierarchical
methods depend on precise entity partitioning and strict containment, limiting
effectiveness in dynamic environments. To address this, we propose the
Hierarchical Cross-Granularity Contrastive and Matching learning (HCCM)
framework with two components: (1) Region-Global Image-Text Contrastive
Learning (RG-ITC), which avoids precise scene partitioning and captures
hierarchical local-to-global semantics by contrasting local visual regions with
global text and vice versa; (2) Region-Global Image-Text Matching (RG-ITM),
which dispenses with rigid constraints and instead evaluates local semantic
consistency within global cross-modal representations, enhancing compositional
reasoning. Moreover, drone text descriptions are often incomplete or ambiguous,
destabilizing alignment. HCCM introduces a Momentum Contrast and Distillation
(MCD) mechanism to improve robustness. Experiments on GeoText-1652 show HCCM
achieves state-of-the-art Recall@1 of 28.8% (image retrieval) and 14.7% (text
retrieval). On the unseen ERA dataset, HCCM demonstrates strong zero-shot
generalization with 39.93% mean recall (mR), outperforming fine-tuned
baselines.

Conclusion: 提出的生成式方法相比传统回归方法，能够更好地处理3D场景重建中的遮挡和未观测区域问题，生成更完整和合理的3D表示

Abstract: Gaussian splatting typically requires dense observations of the scene and can
fail to reconstruct occluded and unobserved areas. We propose a latent
diffusion model to reconstruct a complete 3D scene with Gaussian splats,
including the occluded parts, from only a single image during inference.
Completing the unobserved surfaces of a scene is challenging due to the
ambiguity of the plausible surfaces. Conventional methods use a
regression-based formulation to predict a single "mode" for occluded and
out-of-frustum surfaces, leading to blurriness, implausibility, and failure to
capture multiple possible explanations. Thus, they often address this problem
partially, focusing either on objects isolated from the background,
reconstructing only visible surfaces, or failing to extrapolate far from the
input views. In contrast, we propose a generative formulation to learn a
distribution of 3D representations of Gaussian splats conditioned on a single
input image. To address the lack of ground-truth training data, we propose a
Variational AutoReconstructor to learn a latent space only from 2D images in a
self-supervised manner, over which a diffusion model is trained. Our method
generates faithful reconstructions and diverse samples with the ability to
complete the occluded surfaces for high-quality 360-degree renderings.

Conclusion: 结合CLIP先验知识和不确定性感知采样，为成对排序提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: Pairwise comparison is often favored over absolute rating or ordinal
classification in subjective or difficult annotation tasks due to its improved
reliability. However, exhaustive comparisons require a massive number of
annotations (O(n^2)). Recent work has greatly reduced the annotation burden
(O(n log n)) by actively sampling pairwise comparisons using a sorting
algorithm. We further improve annotation efficiency by (1) roughly pre-ordering
items using the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model
hierarchically without training, and (2) replacing easy, obvious human
comparisons with automated comparisons. The proposed EZ-Sort first produces a
CLIP-based zero-shot pre-ordering, then initializes bucket-aware Elo scores,
and finally runs an uncertainty-guided human-in-the-loop MergeSort. Validation
was conducted using various datasets: face-age estimation (FGNET), historical
image chronology (DHCI), and retinal image quality assessment (EyePACS). It
showed that EZ-Sort reduced human annotation cost by 90.5% compared to
exhaustive pairwise comparisons and by 19.8% compared to prior work (when n =
100), while improving or maintaining inter-rater reliability. These results
demonstrate that combining CLIP-based priors with uncertainty-aware sampling
yields an efficient and scalable solution for pairwise ranking.

Abstract: Modeling human-object interactions (HOI) from an egocentric perspective is a
largely unexplored yet important problem due to the increasing adoption of
wearable devices, such as smart glasses and watches. We investigate how much
information about interaction can be recovered from only head and wrists
tracking. Our answer is ECHO (Ego-Centric modeling of Human-Object
interactions), which, for the first time, proposes a unified framework to
recover three modalities: human pose, object motion, and contact from such
minimal observation. ECHO employs a Diffusion Transformer architecture and a
unique three-variate diffusion process, which jointly models human motion,
object trajectory, and contact sequence, allowing for flexible input
configurations. Our method operates in a head-centric canonical space,
enhancing robustness to global orientation. We propose a conveyor-based
inference, which progressively increases the diffusion timestamp with the frame
position, allowing us to process sequences of any length. Through extensive
evaluation, we demonstrate that ECHO outperforms existing methods that do not
offer the same flexibility, setting a state-of-the-art in egocentric HOI
reconstruction.

### [40] [How Well Do Vision--Language Models Understand Cities? A Comparative Study on Spatial Reasoning from Street-View Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21565)
*Juneyoung Ro,Namwoo Kim,Yoonjin Yoon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究评估了三种现有视觉-语言模型在城市场景空间推理任务上的表现，通过构建合成问答数据集和细调提升了模型在具体城市场景中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言模型在通用场景上领先，但在城市场景的细粒度空间推理能力方面的转移效果仍未得到充分探索。

Method: 构建了一个合成的问答数据集，基于街景图像的分割、深度和物体检测预测，并为每个问题配备了由大语言模型生成的链式思维答案。评估了BLIP-2、InstructBLIP和LLaVA-1.5三种模型的零样本性能和细调效果。

Result: 零样本情况下VLMs表现谨慎好，但使用合成CoT监督数据集进行细调后性能显著提升，尤其是在否定和反事实问题类型上。

Conclusion: 本研究将城市空间推理作为VLMs的新挑战，并证明了合成数据集构建是将通用模型适配到专业领域的有效途径。

Abstract: Effectively understanding urban scenes requires fine-grained spatial
reasoning about objects, layouts, and depth cues. However, how well current
vision-language models (VLMs), pretrained on general scenes, transfer these
abilities to urban domain remains underexplored. To address this gap, we
conduct a comparative study of three off-the-shelf VLMs-BLIP-2, InstructBLIP,
and LLaVA-1.5-evaluating both zero-shot performance and the effects of
fine-tuning with a synthetic VQA dataset specific to urban scenes. We construct
such dataset from segmentation, depth, and object detection predictions of
street-view images, pairing each question with LLM-generated Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) answers for step-by-step reasoning supervision. Results show that while
VLMs perform reasonably well in zero-shot settings, fine-tuning with our
synthetic CoT-supervised dataset substantially boosts performance, especially
for challenging question types such as negation and counterfactuals. This study
introduces urban spatial reasoning as a new challenge for VLMs and demonstrates
synthetic dataset construction as a practical path for adapting general-purpose
models to specialized domains.

*Nico Albert Disch,Yannick Kirchhoff,Robin Peretzke,Maximilian Rokuss,Saikat Roy,Constantin Ulrich,David Zimmerer,Klaus Maier-Hein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Temporal Flow Matching (TFM)方法，用于4D医学图像预测，通过学习时间分布来生成精细的空间预测，在三个公共纵向数据集上达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法要么只考虑单一时间上下文，要么专注于分类或回归任务，无法进行精细的空间预测，且多数方法局限于单时间点、特定疾病或有其他技术限制。

Method: Temporal Flow Matching (TFM)是一种统一的生成轨迹方法，能够学习底层时间分布，支持3D体积、多个先验扫描和不规则采样，并能回退到最近图像预测器作为特例。

Result: 在三个公共纵向数据集上的广泛基准测试表明，TFM始终超越自然成像中的时空方法，为4D医学图像预测建立了新的最先进和稳健的基线。

Conclusion: TFM填补了医学成像中时间动态建模的基本空白，为疾病进展建模、治疗计划和解剖发育跟踪等应用提供了强大的解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding temporal dynamics in medical imaging is crucial for
applications such as disease progression modeling, treatment planning and
anatomical development tracking. However, most deep learning methods either
consider only single temporal contexts, or focus on tasks like classification
or regression, limiting their ability for fine-grained spatial predictions.
While some approaches have been explored, they are often limited to single
timepoints, specific diseases or have other technical restrictions. To address
this fundamental gap, we introduce Temporal Flow Matching (TFM), a unified
generative trajectory method that (i) aims to learn the underlying temporal
distribution, (ii) by design can fall back to a nearest image predictor, i.e.
predicting the last context image (LCI), as a special case, and (iii) supports
$3D$ volumes, multiple prior scans, and irregular sampling. Extensive
benchmarks on three public longitudinal datasets show that TFM consistently
surpasses spatio-temporal methods from natural imaging, establishing a new
state-of-the-art and robust baseline for $4D$ medical image prediction.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了整合术前CT和术后病理WSI的多模态深度学习模型，用于透明细胞肾癌复发预测，发现病理信息具有更强预后价值，中间融合策略能进一步提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leibovich评分在透明细胞肾癌复发风险评估中应用广泛，但存在患者层面分辨率有限且缺乏影像信息的局限性，需要开发更精准的多模态预测方法。

Method: 采用模块化深度学习框架，使用预训练编码器和基于Cox的生存模型，测试了单模态、晚期融合和中间融合三种设置，整合CT和病理全切片图像。

Result: 病理WSI模型始终优于CT-only模型，中间融合进一步改善性能，最佳模型接近调整后的Leibovich评分。影像学通过融合增加价值，但病理学显示更强的预后能力。

Conclusion: 证明了基于基础模型的多模态整合在个性化ccRCC风险预测中的可行性，未来需要探索更具表现力的融合策略、更大数据集和通用CT编码器。

Abstract: Recurrence risk estimation in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is
essential for guiding postoperative surveillance and treatment. The Leibovich
score remains widely used for stratifying distant recurrence risk but offers
limited patient-level resolution and excludes imaging information. This study
evaluates multimodal recurrence prediction by integrating preoperative computed
tomography (CT) and postoperative histopathology whole-slide images (WSIs). A
modular deep learning framework with pretrained encoders and Cox-based survival
modeling was tested across unimodal, late fusion, and intermediate fusion
setups. In a real-world ccRCC cohort, WSI-based models consistently
outperformed CT-only models, underscoring the prognostic strength of pathology.
Intermediate fusion further improved performance, with the best model
(TITAN-CONCH with ResNet-18) approaching the adjusted Leibovich score. Random
tie-breaking narrowed the gap between the clinical baseline and learned models,
suggesting discretization may overstate individualized performance. Using
simple embedding concatenation, radiology added value primarily through fusion.
These findings demonstrate the feasibility of foundation model-based multimodal
integration for personalized ccRCC risk prediction. Future work should explore
more expressive fusion strategies, larger multimodal datasets, and
general-purpose CT encoders to better match pathology modeling capacity.

TL;DR: 提出了一种深度展开网络(DUN)，通过自适应带宽保持模型(ABPM)和相位域复值去噪器(PCD)来解决计算机生成全息术中的非线性不适定问题，实现了超过35dB的PSNR性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有深度学习方法在全息重建中存在的三个主要问题：端到端网络忽视物理关系导致可解释性差、CNN方法感受野有限无法捕获长程依赖、ASM方法局限于有限近场距离。

Method: 采用深度展开网络框架，将梯度下降分解为两个模块：自适应带宽保持模型(ABPM)扩展工作距离，相位域复值去噪器(PCD)使用复值可变形自注意力模块捕获全局特征。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据上实现了超过35dB的PSNR，达到了最先进的性能水平，ABPM相比ASM方法具有更宽的工作距离。

Conclusion: 所提出的深度展开网络通过结合物理模型和深度学习优势，有效解决了计算机生成全息术中的重建挑战，提供了更好的可解释性和灵活性。

Abstract: Computer-generated holography (CGH) has gained wide attention with deep
learning-based algorithms. However, due to its nonlinear and ill-posed nature,
challenges remain in achieving accurate and stable reconstruction.
Specifically, ($i$) the widely used end-to-end networks treat the
reconstruction model as a black box, ignoring underlying physical
relationships, which reduces interpretability and flexibility. ($ii$) CNN-based
CGH algorithms have limited receptive fields, hindering their ability to
capture long-range dependencies and global context. ($iii$) Angular spectrum
method (ASM)-based models are constrained to finite near-fields.In this paper,
we propose a Deep Unfolding Network (DUN) that decomposes gradient descent into
two modules: an adaptive bandwidth-preserving model (ABPM) and a phase-domain
complex-valued denoiser (PCD), providing more flexibility. ABPM allows for
wider working distances compared to ASM-based methods. At the same time, PCD
leverages its complex-valued deformable self-attention module to capture global
features and enhance performance, achieving a PSNR over 35 dB. Experiments on
simulated and real data show state-of-the-art results.

Motivation: 解决全身PET/CT中由于示踪剂异质性、生理性摄取和多中心变异性导致的准确病灶分割挑战，开发保持人类在环的高效交互式分割方法。

Method: 扩展autoPET III nnU-Net框架，将用户提供的前景和背景点击编码为额外输入通道；系统研究空间提示表示，采用欧氏距离变换编码；提出在线模拟用户交互和自定义点采样策略。

Result: 基于EDT的集成模型在交叉验证中表现最佳，相比基线模型减少了假阳性和假阴性；在有无外部数据训练的情况下均取得最强性能。

Conclusion: 可提示模型在多示踪剂、多中心PET/CT中具有实现高效用户引导分割工作流程的潜力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Whole-body PET/CT is a cornerstone of oncological imaging, yet accurate
lesion segmentation remains challenging due to tracer heterogeneity,
physiological uptake, and multi-center variability. While fully automated
methods have advanced substantially, clinical practice benefits from approaches
that keep humans in the loop to efficiently refine predicted masks. The
autoPET/CT IV challenge addresses this need by introducing interactive
segmentation tasks based on simulated user prompts. In this work, we present
our submission to Task 1. Building on the winning autoPET III nnU-Net pipeline,
we extend the framework with promptable capabilities by encoding user-provided
foreground and background clicks as additional input channels. We
systematically investigate representations for spatial prompts and demonstrate
that Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT) encodings consistently outperform
Gaussian kernels. Furthermore, we propose online simulation of user
interactions and a custom point sampling strategy to improve robustness under
realistic prompting conditions. Our ensemble of EDT-based models, trained with
and without external data, achieves the strongest cross-validation performance,
reducing both false positives and false negatives compared to baseline models.
These results highlight the potential of promptable models to enable efficient,
user-guided segmentation workflows in multi-tracer, multi-center PET/CT. Code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HD地图构建方法使用标准映射技术存在泛化问题，经常产生不存在的道路元素幻觉，需要更准确的图像到BEV空间的映射

Method: 基于相机参数的几何映射，通过概率投影机制和置信度分数来优化映射对齐和过滤无关元素，改进时间处理选择性积累可靠信息

Result: 在nuScenes和Argoverse2数据集的新划分上表现出优于最先进方法的性能，特别是在nuScenes和长感知范围挑战中改进显著

Conclusion: 提出的概率投影机制通过置信度分数有效提高了HD地图构建的准确性和泛化能力，特别是在复杂场景和长距离感知方面

Abstract: Constructing high-definition (HD) maps from sensory input requires accurately
mapping the road elements in image space to the Bird's Eye View (BEV) space.
The precision of this mapping directly impacts the quality of the final
vectorized HD map. Existing HD mapping approaches outsource the projection to
standard mapping techniques, such as attention-based ones. However, these
methods struggle with accuracy due to generalization problems, often
hallucinating non-existent road elements. Our key idea is to start with a
geometric mapping based on camera parameters and adapt it to the scene to
extract relevant map information from camera images. To implement this, we
propose a novel probabilistic projection mechanism with confidence scores to
(i) refine the mapping to better align with the scene and (ii) filter out
irrelevant elements that should not influence HD map generation. In addition,
we improve temporal processing by using confidence scores to selectively
accumulate reliable information over time. Experiments on new splits of the
nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate improved performance over
state-of-the-art approaches, indicating better generalization. The improvements
are particularly pronounced on nuScenes and in the challenging long perception
range. Our code and model checkpoints are available at

TL;DR: 该论文提出从基于单词的OCR转向基于行级别的OCR方法，通过绕过错误单词分割并提供更大的句子上下文来提升准确性和效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统OCR方法存在字符分割错误问题，现代方法转向单词级别OCR但带来了单词分割瓶颈。作者观察到需要进一步发展到行级别OCR来绕过单词检测错误并提供更好的语言模型利用

Method: 提出从单词级别OCR到行级别OCR的自然演进，使用序列到序列翻译方法直接处理整行文本，避免单词分割步骤

Result: 实验显示端到端准确率提升5.4%，效率比基于单词的流程提升4倍，并贡献了包含251个英文页面图像的行级别标注数据集

Conclusion: 行级别OCR不仅提高了准确性和效率，还为利用大型语言模型的进步提供了潜力，特别适用于文档图像处理

Abstract: Conventional optical character recognition (OCR) techniques segmented each
character and then recognized. This made them prone to error in character
segmentation, and devoid of context to exploit language models. Advances in
sequence to sequence translation in last decade led to modern techniques first
detecting words and then inputting one word at a time to a model to directly
output full words as sequence of characters. This allowed better utilization of
language models and bypass error-prone character segmentation step. We observe
that the above transition in style has moved the bottleneck in accuracy to word
segmentation. Hence, in this paper, we propose a natural and logical
progression from word level OCR to line-level OCR. The proposal allows to
bypass errors in word detection, and provides larger sentence context for
better utilization of language models. We show that the proposed technique not
only improves the accuracy but also efficiency of OCR. Despite our thorough
literature survey, we did not find any public dataset to train and benchmark
such shift from word to line-level OCR. Hence, we also contribute a
meticulously curated dataset of 251 English page images with line-level
annotations. Our experimentation revealed a notable end-to-end accuracy
improvement of 5.4%, underscoring the potential benefits of transitioning
towards line-level OCR, especially for document images. We also report a 4
times improvement in efficiency compared to word-based pipelines. With
continuous improvements in large language models, our methodology also holds
potential to exploit such advances. Project Website:

TL;DR: FLORA是一个轻量级合成数据生成管道，使用LoRA微调Flux 1.1扩散模型，大幅降低计算需求，仅需消费级GPU和500张合成图像就能在目标检测任务上超越基线方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有扩散模型需要企业级GPU和大量合成图像进行全微调的高计算成本问题，使合成数据生成更加实用和可访问。

Method: 使用Flux 1.1 Dev扩散模型，通过低秩适应（LoRA）进行专门微调，构建轻量级合成数据生成管道。

Result: 在7个不同目标检测数据集上，仅用500张合成图像训练的检测器性能优于使用5000张合成图像的ODGEN基线，mAP@.50:.95提升高达21.3%。

Conclusion: FLORA证明了质量和效率导向的方法比暴力生成更有效，仅用10%的数据和少量计算成本就能实现最先进性能，使高级合成数据创建更加实用和可访问。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have demonstrated
significant potential in augmenting scarce datasets for object detection tasks.
Nevertheless, most recent models rely on resource-intensive full fine-tuning of
large-scale diffusion models, requiring enterprise-grade GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA
V100) and thousands of synthetic images. To address these limitations, we
propose Flux LoRA Augmentation (FLORA), a lightweight synthetic data generation
pipeline. Our approach uses the Flux 1.1 Dev diffusion model, fine-tuned
exclusively through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). This dramatically reduces
computational requirements, enabling synthetic dataset generation with a
consumer-grade GPU (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 4090). We empirically evaluate our
approach on seven diverse object detection datasets. Our results demonstrate
that training object detectors with just 500 synthetic images generated by our
approach yields superior detection performance compared to models trained on
5000 synthetic images from the ODGEN baseline, achieving improvements of up to
21.3% in mAP@.50:.95. This work demonstrates that it is possible to surpass
state-of-the-art performance with far greater efficiency, as FLORA achieves
superior results using only 10% of the data and a fraction of the computational
cost. This work demonstrates that a quality and efficiency-focused approach is
more effective than brute-force generation, making advanced synthetic data
creation more practical and accessible for real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities across various multimodal tasks. They continue,
however, to struggle with trivial scenarios such as reading values from Digital
Measurement Devices (DMDs), particularly in real-world conditions involving
clutter, occlusions, extreme viewpoints, and motion blur; common in
head-mounted cameras and Augmented Reality (AR) applications. Motivated by
these limitations, this work introduces CAD2DMD-SET, a synthetic data
generation tool designed to support visual question answering (VQA) tasks
involving DMDs. By leveraging 3D CAD models, advanced rendering, and
high-fidelity image composition, our tool produces diverse, VQA-labelled
synthetic DMD datasets suitable for fine-tuning LVLMs. Additionally, we present
DMDBench, a curated validation set of 1,000 annotated real-world images
designed to evaluate model performance under practical constraints.
Benchmarking three state-of-the-art LVLMs using Average Normalised Levenshtein
Similarity (ANLS) and further fine-tuning LoRA's of these models with
CAD2DMD-SET's generated dataset yielded substantial improvements, with InternVL
showcasing a score increase of 200% without degrading on other tasks. This
demonstrates that the CAD2DMD-SET training dataset substantially improves the
robustness and performance of LVLMs when operating under the previously stated
challenging conditions. The CAD2DMD-SET tool is expected to be released as
open-source once the final version of this manuscript is prepared, allowing the
community to add different measurement devices and generate their own datasets.

Abstract: Visual sound source localization is a fundamental perception task that aims
to detect the location of sounding sources in a video given its audio. Despite
recent progress, we identify two shortcomings in current methods: 1) most
approaches perform poorly in cases with low audio-visual semantic
correspondence such as silence, noise, and offscreen sounds, i.e. in the
presence of negative audio; and 2) most prior evaluations are limited to
positive cases, where both datasets and metrics convey scenarios with a single
visible sound source in the scene. To address this, we introduce three key
contributions. First, we propose a new training strategy that incorporates
silence and noise, which improves performance in positive cases, while being
more robust against negative sounds. Our resulting self-supervised model,
SSL-SaN, achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other
self-supervised models, both in sound localization and cross-modal retrieval.
Second, we propose a new metric that quantifies the trade-off between alignment
and separability of auditory and visual features across positive and negative
audio-visual pairs. Third, we present IS3+, an extended and improved version of
the IS3 synthetic dataset with negative audio.

Abstract: GUI agent aims to enable automated operations on Mobile/PC devices, which is
an important task toward achieving artificial general intelligence. The rapid
advancement of VLMs accelerates the development of GUI agents, owing to their
powerful capabilities in visual understanding and task planning. However,
building a GUI agent remains a challenging task due to the scarcity of
operation trajectories, the availability of interactive infrastructure, and the
limitation of initial capabilities in foundation models. In this work, we
introduce UItron, an open-source foundational model for automatic GUI agents,
featuring advanced GUI perception, grounding, and planning capabilities. UItron
highlights the necessity of systemic data engineering and interactive
infrastructure as foundational components for advancing GUI agent development.
It not only systematically studies a series of data engineering strategies to
enhance training effects, but also establishes an interactive environment
connecting both Mobile and PC devices. In training, UItron adopts supervised
finetuning over perception and planning tasks in various GUI scenarios, and
then develop a curriculum reinforcement learning framework to enable complex
reasoning and exploration for online environments. As a result, UItron achieves
superior performance in benchmarks of GUI perception, grounding, and planning.
In particular, UItron highlights the interaction proficiency with top-tier
Chinese mobile APPs, as we identified a general lack of Chinese capabilities
even in state-of-the-art solutions. To this end, we manually collect over one
million steps of operation trajectories across the top 100 most popular apps,
and build the offline and online agent evaluation environments. Experimental
results demonstrate that UItron achieves significant progress in Chinese app
scenarios, propelling GUI agents one step closer to real-world application.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前域泛化评估对基础模型如CLIP不够挑战性，因为其预训练数据可能已覆盖现有基准。需要更好地评估CLIP在真实未见数据场景下的性能。

Method: CLIP-DCA方法：1）使用单独领域头识别和增强CLIP编码器中的领域感知；2）通过合成生成多样化领域数据；3）鼓励从领域特征中分离实现领域不变分类

Result: CLIP-DCA在33个多样化数据集上显著优于现有方法，特别是在更分布外的数据集上表现更好

Conclusion: 增强领域感知是基础模型实现有效领域不变分类的前提，CLIP-DCA通过分离领域感知和分类任务成功提升了域泛化性能

Abstract: Evaluating domain generalization (DG) for foundational models like CLIP is
challenging, as web-scale pretraining data potentially covers many existing
benchmarks. Consequently, current DG evaluation may neither be sufficiently
challenging nor adequately test genuinely unseen data scenarios. To better
assess the performance of CLIP on DG in-the-wild, a scenario where CLIP
encounters challenging unseen data, we consider two approaches: (1) evaluating
on 33 diverse datasets with quantified out-of-distribution (OOD) scores after
fine-tuning CLIP on ImageNet, and (2) using unlearning to make CLIP `forget'
some domains as an approximation. We observe that CLIP's performance
deteriorates significantly on more OOD datasets. To address this, we present
CLIP-DCA (Disentangling Classification from enhanced domain Aware
representations). Our approach is motivated by the observation that while
standard domain invariance losses aim to make representations domain-invariant,
this can be harmful to foundation models by forcing the discarding of
domain-aware representations beneficial for generalization. We instead
hypothesize that enhancing domain awareness is a prerequisite for effective
domain-invariant classification in foundation models. CLIP-DCA identifies and
enhances domain awareness within CLIP's encoders using a separate domain head
and synthetically generated diverse domain data. Simultaneously, it encourages
domain-invariant classification through disentanglement from the domain
features. CLIP-DCA shows significant improvements within this challenging
evaluation compared to existing methods, particularly on datasets that are more
OOD.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在视频学习中引入非典型异常数据对开放世界学习的益处，发现即使简单地将这些数据加入训练过程也能持续提升OOD检测、新类别发现和零样本动作识别等任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类在开放世界中面对不常见的新概念时表现出卓越的泛化和发现能力，而现有研究主要关注封闭集中的典型数据。论文旨在探索非典型异常视频数据如何促进开放世界学习。

Method: 收集包含各种非典型异常数据（如科幻、动画等）的新视频数据集，将其加入模型训练过程进行表示学习，重点关注OOD检测、新类别发现和零样本动作识别三个关键任务。

Result: 实验表明：1）即使简单使用非典型数据也能持续提升性能；2）增加非典型样本的类别多样性进一步提升OOD检测性能；3）在NCD任务中，使用更小但语义更多样的非典型数据集比使用更大但更典型的数据集效果更好；4）在ZSAR任务中，非典型视频的语义多样性帮助模型更好地泛化到未见动作类别。

Conclusion: 非典型视频对开放世界中的视觉表示学习具有显著益处，新提出的数据集和发现鼓励该方向的进一步研究。

Abstract: Humans usually show exceptional generalisation and discovery ability in the
open world, when being shown uncommon new concepts. Whereas most existing
studies in the literature focus on common typical data from closed sets,
open-world novel discovery is under-explored in videos. In this paper, we are
interested in asking: \textit{What if atypical unusual videos are exposed in
the learning process?} To this end, we collect a new video dataset consisting
of various types of unusual atypical data (\eg sci-fi, animation, \etc). To
study how such atypical data may benefit open-world learning, we feed them into
the model training process for representation learning. Focusing on three key
tasks in open-world learning: out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, novel
category discovery (NCD), and zero-shot action recognition (ZSAR), we found
that even straightforward learning approaches with atypical data consistently
improve performance across various settings. Furthermore, we found that
increasing the categorical diversity of the atypical samples further boosts OOD
detection performance. Additionally, in the NCD task, using a smaller yet more
semantically diverse set of atypical samples leads to better performance
compared to using a larger but more typical dataset. In the ZSAR setting, the
semantic diversity of atypical videos helps the model generalise better to
unseen action classes. These observations in our extensive experimental
evaluations reveal the benefits of atypical videos for visual representation
learning in the open world, together with the newly proposed dataset,
encouraging further studies in this direction.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无监督视频持续学习(uVCL)方案，通过核密度估计和新颖性检测来处理无标签、无任务边界的视频学习问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频数据具有丰富的空间-时间信息，但在无监督持续学习领域研究不足。现有研究依赖标签和任务边界，而标签数据成本高且不实用。

Method: 使用无监督视频Transformer网络提取深度嵌入特征，采用核密度估计(KDE)作为数据的非参数概率表示，通过新颖性检测动态扩展内存集群来捕捉新知识。

Result: 在UCF101、HMDB51和Something-to-Something V2三个标准视频动作识别数据集上进行深度评估，无需任何标签或类别边界，该方法显著提升了模型在连续学习多个任务时的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为无监督视频持续学习领域提供了一个可行的非参数化解决方案，有效解决了视频数据处理的计算和内存挑战，为该领域的进一步研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: We propose a realistic scenario for the unsupervised video learning where
neither task boundaries nor labels are provided when learning a succession of
tasks. We also provide a non-parametric learning solution for the
under-explored problem of unsupervised video continual learning. Videos
represent a complex and rich spatio-temporal media information, widely used in
many applications, but which have not been sufficiently explored in
unsupervised continual learning. Prior studies have only focused on supervised
continual learning, relying on the knowledge of labels and task boundaries,
while having labeled data is costly and not practical. To address this gap, we
study the unsupervised video continual learning (uVCL). uVCL raises more
challenges due to the additional computational and memory requirements of
processing videos when compared to images. We introduce a general benchmark
experimental protocol for uVCL by considering the learning of unstructured
video data categories during each task. We propose to use the Kernel Density
Estimation (KDE) of deep embedded video features extracted by unsupervised
video transformer networks as a non-parametric probabilistic representation of
the data. We introduce a novelty detection criterion for the incoming new task
data, dynamically enabling the expansion of memory clusters, aiming to capture
new knowledge when learning a succession of tasks. We leverage the use of
transfer learning from the previous tasks as an initial state for the knowledge
transfer to the current learning task. We found that the proposed methodology
substantially enhances the performance of the model when successively learning
many tasks. We perform in-depth evaluations on three standard video action
recognition datasets, including UCF101, HMDB51, and Something-to-Something V2,
without using any labels or class boundaries.

<details>

Motivation: 胰腺导管腺癌MRI自动分割面临肿瘤组织对比度差和标注数据稀缺的挑战，需要开发在有限数据下高性能的专门化模型

Method: 使用nnU-Net框架，采用深度多阶段级联预训练策略：从通用解剖基础模型开始，依次在CT胰腺病变数据集和目标MRI模态上微调。通过五折交叉验证评估数据增强方案，构建定制化的异构专家模型集成

Result: Task 1获得0.661的Tumor Dice分数，Task 2获得0.523的Tumor Dice分数，Task 1达到最先进的MASD 5.46 mm和HD95 17.33 mm边界精度

Conclusion: 提出了一种在有限数据和复杂医学成像任务中开发专门化高性能模型的稳健方法，通过度量感知集成策略有效解决了数据增强的权衡问题

Abstract: Automated segmentation of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) from MRI is
critical for clinical workflows but is hindered by poor tumor-tissue contrast
and a scarcity of annotated data. This paper details our submission to the
PANTHER challenge, addressing both diagnostic T1-weighted (Task 1) and
therapeutic T2-weighted (Task 2) segmentation. Our approach is built upon the
nnU-Net framework and leverages a deep, multi-stage cascaded pre-training
strategy, starting from a general anatomical foundation model and sequentially
fine-tuning on CT pancreatic lesion datasets and the target MRI modalities.
Through extensive five-fold cross-validation, we systematically evaluated data
augmentation schemes and training schedules. Our analysis revealed a critical
trade-off, where aggressive data augmentation produced the highest volumetric
accuracy, while default augmentations yielded superior boundary precision
(achieving a state-of-the-art MASD of 5.46 mm and HD95 of 17.33 mm for Task 1).
For our final submission, we exploited this finding by constructing custom,
heterogeneous ensembles of specialist models, essentially creating a mix of
experts. This metric-aware ensembling strategy proved highly effective,
achieving a top cross-validation Tumor Dice score of 0.661 for Task 1 and 0.523
for Task 2. Our work presents a robust methodology for developing specialized,
high-performance models in the context of limited data and complex medical
imaging tasks (Team MIC-DKFZ).

TL;DR: GPT-5在放射肿瘤学领域表现优异，在多项选择题测试中准确率达到92.8%，明显优于GPT-4和GPT-3.5，在真实病例治疗建议生成中也获得较高评分，但仍需专家监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型GPT-5在临床决策支持，特别是放射肿瘤学领域的应用潜力，验证其在该专业领域的表现。

Method: 使用两个基准测试：300道多项选择题的ACR放射肿瘤学培训考试和60个真实放射肿瘤病例。四位认证放射肿瘤科医生评估治疗建议的正确性、完整性和幻觉现象。

Result: GPT-5在多项选择题测试中准确率92.8%，显著优于GPT-4(78.8%)和GPT-3.5(62.1%)。在病例评估中，正确性评分3.24/4，完整性评分3.59/4，幻觉现象罕见。

Conclusion: GPT-5在放射肿瘤学领域表现出色，但仍存在改进空间，生成的建议需要专家严格监督才能临床使用。

Abstract: Introduction: Large language models (LLM) have shown great potential in
clinical decision support. GPT-5 is a novel LLM system that has been
specifically marketed towards oncology use.
  Methods: Performance was assessed using two complementary benchmarks: (i) the
ACR Radiation Oncology In-Training Examination (TXIT, 2021), comprising 300
multiple-choice items, and (ii) a curated set of 60 authentic radiation
oncologic vignettes representing diverse disease sites and treatment
indications. For the vignette evaluation, GPT-5 was instructed to generate
concise therapeutic plans. Four board-certified radiation oncologists rated
correctness, comprehensiveness, and hallucinations. Inter-rater reliability was
quantified using Fleiss' \k{appa}.
  Results: On the TXIT benchmark, GPT-5 achieved a mean accuracy of 92.8%,
outperforming GPT-4 (78.8%) and GPT-3.5 (62.1%). Domain-specific gains were
most pronounced in Dose and Diagnosis. In the vignette evaluation, GPT-5's
treatment recommendations were rated highly for correctness (mean 3.24/4, 95%
CI: 3.11-3.38) and comprehensiveness (3.59/4, 95% CI: 3.49-3.69).
Hallucinations were rare with no case reaching majority consensus for their
presence. Inter-rater agreement was low (Fleiss' \k{appa} 0.083 for
correctness), reflecting inherent variability in clinical judgment. Errors
clustered in complex scenarios requiring precise trial knowledge or detailed
clinical adaptation.
  Discussion: GPT-5 clearly outperformed prior model variants on the radiation
oncology multiple-choice benchmark. Although GPT-5 exhibited favorable
performance in generating real-world radiation oncology treatment
recommendations, correctness ratings indicate room for further improvement.
While hallucinations were infrequent, the presence of substantive errors
underscores that GPT-5-generated recommendations require rigorous expert
oversight before clinical implementation.

TL;DR: 提出了TMUAD框架，通过三类互补的记忆库（文本、对象、补丁级）统一检测结构和逻辑异常，在多个数据集上达到最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖图像特征提取器和记忆库来捕获对象间逻辑关系，但正常数据有限且逻辑异常检测困难

Method: 构建三类记忆库：1）类级文本记忆库用于逻辑异常检测；2）对象级图像记忆库保留完整轮廓；3）补丁级记忆库用于结构异常检测，通过多级检索和分数融合

Result: 在7个公开数据集（工业和医疗领域）上实现了最先进的性能

Conclusion: 通过协作记忆库统一结构和逻辑异常检测是有效的，TMUAD框架具有优异性能

Abstract: Anomaly detection, which aims to identify anomalies deviating from normal
patterns, is challenging due to the limited amount of normal data available.
Unlike most existing unified methods that rely on carefully designed image
feature extractors and memory banks to capture logical relationships between
objects, we introduce a text memory bank to enhance the detection of logical
anomalies. Specifically, we propose a Three-Memory framework for Unified
structural and logical Anomaly Detection (TMUAD). First, we build a class-level
text memory bank for logical anomaly detection by the proposed logic-aware text
extractor, which can capture rich logical descriptions of objects from input
images. Second, we construct an object-level image memory bank that preserves
complete object contours by extracting features from segmented objects. Third,
we employ visual encoders to extract patch-level image features for
constructing a patch-level memory bank for structural anomaly detection. These
three complementary memory banks are used to retrieve and compare normal images
that are most similar to the query image, compute anomaly scores at multiple
levels, and fuse them into a final anomaly score. By unifying structural and
logical anomaly detection through collaborative memory banks, TMUAD achieves
state-of-the-art performance across seven publicly available datasets involving
industrial and medical domains. The model and code are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频理解需要细粒度定位掩码和详细语义属性，但获取此类数据既繁琐又昂贵。

Method: 通过预处理带有真实掩码的视频来突出感兴趣物体，并使用大型视觉语言模型生成伪物体描述，创建SAV-Caption数据集。在大规模数据集上训练VoCap模型。

Conclusion: VoCap模型在多个视频理解任务上表现优异，提出的数据集和方法为视频物体分析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding objects in videos in terms of fine-grained localization masks
and detailed semantic properties is a fundamental task in video understanding.
In this paper, we propose VoCap, a flexible video model that consumes a video
and a prompt of various modalities (text, box or mask), and produces a
spatio-temporal masklet with a corresponding object-centric caption. As such
our model addresses simultaneously the tasks of promptable video object
segmentation, referring expression segmentation, and object captioning. Since
obtaining data for this task is tedious and expensive, we propose to annotate
an existing large-scale segmentation dataset (SAV) with pseudo object captions.
We do so by preprocessing videos with their ground-truth masks to highlight the
object of interest and feed this to a large Vision Language Model (VLM). For an
unbiased evaluation, we collect manual annotations on the validation set. We
call the resulting dataset SAV-Caption. We train our VoCap model at scale on a
SAV-Caption together with a mix of other image and video datasets. Our model
yields state-of-the-art results on referring expression video object
segmentation, is competitive on semi-supervised video object segmentation, and
establishes a benchmark for video object captioning. Our dataset will be made
available at https://github.com/google-deepmind/vocap.

Motivation: 现有方法将动词分类视为单标签问题，但忽略了视觉事件识别中固有的语义模糊性，同一图像可能被多个动词类别合理描述。

Method: 将动词分类重新定义为单正例多标签学习(SPMLL)问题，开发了Graph Enhanced Verb Multilayer Perceptron (GE-VerbMLP)模型，结合图神经网络捕捉标签相关性和对抗训练优化决策边界。

Result: 在真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在保持传统top-1和top-5准确率指标竞争力的同时，实现了超过3%的MAP改进。

Conclusion: 动词分类本质上是多标签问题，SPMLL范式能够更好地处理视觉事件识别的语义模糊性，提出的GE-VerbMLP模型在多标签评估基准上表现优异。

Abstract: Context recognition (SR) is a fundamental task in computer vision that aims
to extract structured semantic summaries from images by identifying key events
and their associated entities. Specifically, given an input image, the model
must first classify the main visual events (verb classification), then identify
the participating entities and their semantic roles (semantic role labeling),
and finally localize these entities in the image (semantic role localization).
Existing methods treat verb classification as a single-label problem, but we
show through a comprehensive analysis that this formulation fails to address
the inherent ambiguity in visual event recognition, as multiple verb categories
may reasonably describe the same image. This paper makes three key
contributions: First, we reveal through empirical analysis that verb
classification is inherently a multi-label problem due to the ubiquitous
semantic overlap between verb categories. Second, given the impracticality of
fully annotating large-scale datasets with multiple labels, we propose to
reformulate verb classification as a single positive multi-label learning
(SPMLL) problem - a novel perspective in SR research. Third, we design a
comprehensive multi-label evaluation benchmark for SR that is carefully
designed to fairly evaluate model performance in a multi-label setting. To
address the challenges of SPMLL, we futher develop the Graph Enhanced Verb
Multilayer Perceptron (GE-VerbMLP), which combines graph neural networks to
capture label correlations and adversarial training to optimize decision
boundaries. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our approach
achieves more than 3\% MAP improvement while remaining competitive on
traditional top-1 and top-5 accuracy metrics.

TL;DR: DriveQA是一个全面的开源文本和视觉基准测试，用于评估LLM和MLLM在驾驶知识测试中的表现，发现现有模型在数值推理、复杂路权场景等方面存在显著弱点，但通过微调可以显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动驾驶基准测试主要关注空间和视觉问答任务，但缺乏对交通规则、标志和路权原则的全面理解评估。人类驾驶员需要识别现实数据集中罕见的边缘案例，因此需要开发一个全面的驾驶知识测试基准。

Method: 开发了DriveQA基准测试，包含文本和视觉模态，涵盖交通法规和场景。通过实验评估最先进的LLM和MLLM模型性能，并进行微调实验和下游任务性能验证。

Result: 1) SOTA模型在基本交通规则上表现良好，但在数值推理、复杂路权场景、交通标志变体和空间布局方面存在显著弱点；2) 在DriveQA上微调可提高多个类别的准确性，特别是在监管标志识别和交叉口决策方面；3) DriveQA-V的环境变化分析揭示了模型对光照、视角、距离和天气条件的敏感性；4) 在DriveQA上预训练可提升下游驾驶任务性能，在nuScenes和BDD等真实数据集上表现更好。

Conclusion: DriveQA基准测试揭示了当前LLM和MLLM在驾驶知识理解方面的局限性，但通过针对性的微调和预训练可以显著改善模型性能，证明模型能够内化文本和合成交通知识，有效泛化到下游问答任务。

Abstract: If a Large Language Model (LLM) were to take a driving knowledge test today,
would it pass? Beyond standard spatial and visual question-answering (QA) tasks
on current autonomous driving benchmarks, driving knowledge tests require a
complete understanding of all traffic rules, signage, and right-of-way
principles. To pass this test, human drivers must discern various edge cases
that rarely appear in real-world datasets. In this work, we present DriveQA, an
extensive open-source text and vision-based benchmark that exhaustively covers
traffic regulations and scenarios. Through our experiments using DriveQA, we
show that (1) state-of-the-art LLMs and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) perform well on
basic traffic rules but exhibit significant weaknesses in numerical reasoning
and complex right-of-way scenarios, traffic sign variations, and spatial
layouts, (2) fine-tuning on DriveQA improves accuracy across multiple
categories, particularly in regulatory sign recognition and intersection
decision-making, (3) controlled variations in DriveQA-V provide insights into
model sensitivity to environmental factors such as lighting, perspective,
distance, and weather conditions, and (4) pretraining on DriveQA enhances
downstream driving task performance, leading to improved results on real-world
datasets such as nuScenes and BDD, while also demonstrating that models can
internalize text and synthetic traffic knowledge to generalize effectively
across downstream QA tasks.

Abstract: To reduce the amount of required labeled data for lung disease severity
classification from chest X-rays (CXRs) under class imbalance, this study
applied deep active learning with a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) approximation
and weighted loss function. This retrospective study collected 2,319 CXRs from
963 patients (mean age, 59.2 $\pm$ 16.6 years; 481 female) at Emory Healthcare
affiliated hospitals between January and November 2020. All patients had
clinically confirmed COVID-19. Each CXR was independently labeled by 3 to 6
board-certified radiologists as normal, moderate, or severe. A deep neural
network with Monte Carlo Dropout was trained using active learning to classify
disease severity. Various acquisition functions were used to iteratively select
the most informative samples from an unlabeled pool. Performance was evaluated
using accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AU
ROC), and area under the precision-recall curve (AU PRC). Training time and
acquisition time were recorded. Statistical analysis included descriptive
metrics and performance comparisons across acquisition strategies. Entropy
Sampling achieved 93.7% accuracy (AU ROC, 0.91) in binary classification
(normal vs. diseased) using 15.4% of the training data. In the multi-class
setting, Mean STD sampling achieved 70.3% accuracy (AU ROC, 0.86) using 23.1%
of the labeled data. These methods outperformed more complex and
computationally expensive acquisition functions and significantly reduced
labeling needs. Deep active learning with BNN approximation and weighted loss
effectively reduces labeled data requirements while addressing class imbalance,
maintaining or exceeding diagnostic performance.

evaluations, including quantitative benchmarks and qualitative visuals on tasks
such as walking and running, demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of
our approach on challenging unregistered meshes.

Motivation: 虽然现有模型如SuGaR在渲染方面提供了有效解决方案，但在视觉保真度和场景一致性方面仍有改进空间

Method: 1）引入有效秩正则化，减少极端各异性（针状形态），促进更均衡的盘状形式 2）集成神经签名距离函数（SDF），通过Eikonal损失保持距离属性，提供连续全局表面前知

Result: 该模型能够从3DGS数据中生成更准确和一致的视觉效果

Conclusion: 通过两种补充性的正则化策略，显著提升了单个高斯原语的保真度和整体表面行为的一致性

Abstract: Reconstructing high-quality 3D meshes and visuals from 3D Gaussian
Splatting(3DGS) still remains a central challenge in computer graphics.
Although existing models such as SuGaR offer effective solutions for rendering,
there is is still room to improve improve both visual fidelity and scene
consistency. This work builds upon SuGaR by introducing two complementary
regularization strategies that address common limitations in both the shape of
individual Gaussians and the coherence of the overall surface. The first
strategy introduces an effective rank regularization, motivated by recent
studies on Gaussian primitive structures. This regularization discourages
extreme anisotropy-specifically, "needle-like" shapes-by favoring more
balanced, "disk-like" forms that are better suited for stable surface
reconstruction. The second strategy integrates a neural Signed Distance
Function (SDF) into the optimization process. The SDF is regularized with an
Eikonal loss to maintain proper distance properties and provides a continuous
global surface prior, guiding Gaussians toward better alignment with the
underlying geometry. These two regularizations aim to improve both the fidelity
of individual Gaussian primitives and their collective surface behavior. The
final model can make more accurate and coherent visuals from 3DGS data.

Motivation: 量子计算的概念抽象且行为反直觉，传统讲座式教学难以让学生充分理解，需要更有效的教学方法

Method: 采用项目式学习(PBL)，让学生实施HHL量子算法与经典ART算法在CT图像重建中的对比研究，并要求撰写会议论文

Conclusion: PBL不仅增强概念理解，还鼓励学生通过研究、实施和反思深入接触新兴技术，建议在量子计算入门课程中整合类似模块

Abstract: Quantum computing introduces abstract concepts and non-intuitive behaviors
that can be challenging for students to grasp through traditional lecture-based
instruction alone. This paper demonstrates how Project-Based Learning (PBL) can
be leveraged to bridge that gap. This can be done by engaging students in a
real-world, interdisciplinary task that combines quantum computing with their
field of interest. As part of a similar assignment, we investigated the
application of the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm for computed
tomography (CT) image reconstruction and benchmarked its performance against
the classical Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (ART). Through implementing
and analyzing both methods on a small-scale problem, we gained practical
experience with quantum algorithms, critically evaluated their limitations, and
developed technical writing and research skills. The experience demonstrated
that Project-Based Learning not only enhances conceptual understanding but also
encourages students to engage deeply with emerging technologies through
research, implementation, and reflection. We recommend the integration of
similar PBL modules in introductory quantum computing courses. The assignment
also works better if students are required to write and submit a
conference-style paper, supported by mentorship from faculty across the
different fields. In such course interdisciplinary, real-world problems can
transform abstract theory into meaningful learning experiences and better
prepare students for future advancements in quantum technologies.

TL;DR: MicroLabVR是一个用户友好的VR工具，用于可视化微生物组的时空模拟数据，帮助研究人员在虚拟现实中交互式探索微生物群落的空间分布和动态变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微生物组对人体健康至关重要，但实验研究困难且现有可视化工具功能有限，需要专业知识。需要开发更易用的工具来帮助研究人员理解微生物组的时空动态。

Method: 开发MicroLabVR工具，将时空数据转换为虚拟现实环境，遵循用户体验指南，支持导入CSV格式的种群增长、物质浓度和代谢通量数据，提供交互式VR可视化功能。

Result: 实现了能够导入多种微生物数据格式并在VR环境中进行交互式探索的工具，增强了数据分析和空间上下文理解能力。

Conclusion: MicroLabVR通过VR技术改善了微生物组时空数据的可视化分析，为研究人员提供了更直观、用户友好的数据探索工具，有助于促进微生物组研究的发展。

Abstract: Microbiomes are a vital part of the human body, engaging in tasks like food
digestion and immune defense. Their structure and function must be understood
in order to promote host health and facilitate swift recovery during disease.
Due to the difficulties in experimentally studying these systems in situ, more
research is being conducted in the field of mathematical modeling. Visualizing
spatiotemporal data is challenging, and current tools that simulate microbial
communities' spatial and temporal development often only provide limited
functionalities, often requiring expert knowledge to generate useful results.
To overcome these limitations, we provide a user-friendly tool to interactively
explore spatiotemporal simulation data, called MicroLabVR, which transfers
spatial data into virtual reality (VR) while following guidelines to enhance
user experience (UX). With MicroLabVR, users can import CSV datasets containing
population growth, substance concentration development, and metabolic flux
distribution data. The implemented visualization methods allow users to
evaluate the dataset in a VR environment interactively. MicroLabVR aims to
improve data analysis for the user by allowing the exploration of microbiome
data in their spatial context.

*Yi-Hao Peng,Dingzeyu Li,Jeffrey P. Bigham,Amy Pavel*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Morae是一个UI代理系统，通过识别任务执行中的决策点并暂停让用户选择，提高盲人和低视力用户的控制权，相比传统端到端代理能更好地满足用户偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前UI代理通常端到端执行任务而不让用户参与关键选择，减少了用户控制权。研究发现BLV用户需要更多参与决策过程来确保选择符合个人偏好。

Method: 使用大型多模态模型解释用户查询、UI代码和截图，在需要决策时暂停并提示用户澄清选择，采用混合主动方法平衡自动化和用户控制。

Result: 在真实网页任务研究中，Morae帮助BLV用户完成更多任务并选择更符合偏好的选项，性能优于包括OpenAI Operator在内的基线代理。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了混合主动方法的有效性，用户既能受益于UI代理的自动化，又能表达个人偏好，为可访问性界面设计提供了新方向。

Abstract: User interface (UI) agents promise to make inaccessible or complex UIs easier
to access for blind and low-vision (BLV) users. However, current UI agents
typically perform tasks end-to-end without involving users in critical choices
or making them aware of important contextual information, thus reducing user
agency. For example, in our field study, a BLV participant asked to buy the
cheapest available sparkling water, and the agent automatically chose one from
several equally priced options, without mentioning alternative products with
different flavors or better ratings. To address this problem, we introduce
Morae, a UI agent that automatically identifies decision points during task
execution and pauses so that users can make choices. Morae uses large
multimodal models to interpret user queries alongside UI code and screenshots,
and prompt users for clarification when there is a choice to be made. In a
study over real-world web tasks with BLV participants, Morae helped users
complete more tasks and select options that better matched their preferences,
as compared to baseline agents, including OpenAI Operator. More broadly, this
work exemplifies a mixed-initiative approach in which users benefit from the
automation of UI agents while being able to express their preferences.

*Weihuan Deng,Yaofu Huang,Luan Chen,Xun Li,Yao Yao*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 基于无人机影像和多模态大语言模型，提出农村宜居性评估框架，分析中国1766个村庄的空间异质性及其影响因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前农村宜居性测量方法存在局限，问卷方法难以扩展，城市导向的视觉感知方法不适用于农村环境，需要开发专门针对农村的评估方法。

Method: 采用自上而下方法收集大规模无人机影像，开发高效图像比较机制和二进制搜索插值，构建适合全国农村宜居性测量的思维链提示，结合专家知识从生活质量和生态宜居性两个维度评估。

Result: 中国农村宜居性呈现双核-边缘空间格局，以四川和浙江为中心向外辐射递减；政府财政支出是核心影响因素，每增加1个单位可使宜居性提升3.9-4.9个单位。

Conclusion: 该研究为农村建设政策制定提供了有价值的见解，证明了基于无人机影像和MLLMs的农村宜居性评估框架的有效性和实用性。

Abstract: With the deepening of poverty alleviation and rural revitalization
strategies, improving the rural living environment and enhancing the quality of
life have become key priorities. Rural livability is a key indicator for
measuring the effectiveness of these efforts. Current measurement approaches
face significant limitations, as questionnaire-based methods are difficult to
scale, while urban-oriented visual perception methods are poorly suited for
rural contexts. In this paper, a rural-specific livability assessment framework
was proposed based on drone imagery and multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). To comprehensively assess village livability, this study first used a
top-down approach to collect large-scale drone imagery of 1,766 villages in 146
counties across China. In terms of the model framework, an efficient image
comparison mechanism was developed, incorporating binary search interpolation
to determine effective image pairs while reducing comparison iterations.
Building on expert knowledge, a chain-of-thought prompting suitable for
nationwide rural livability measurement was constructed, considering both
living quality and ecological habitability dimensions. This approach enhanced
the rationality and reliability of the livability assessment. Finally, this
study characterized the spatial heterogeneity of rural livability across China
and thoroughly analyzed its influential factors. The results show that: (1) The
rural livability in China demonstrates a dual-core-periphery spatial pattern,
radiating outward from Sichuan and Zhejiang provinces with declining gradients;
(2) Among various influential factors, government fiscal expenditure emerged as
the core determinant, with each unit increase corresponding to a 3.9 - 4.9 unit
enhancement in livability. The findings provide valuable insights for rural
construction policy-making.

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: CrossTL是一个通用的编程语言翻译器，通过统一的中间表示CrossGL实现多种编程语言间的双向翻译，支持CUDA、HIP、Metal、HLSL、GLSL、SPIR-V、Rust和Mojo等语言。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要为每对语言单独开发翻译器，导致复杂度呈指数级增长。CrossTL旨在通过统一的中间表示解决这个问题，实现"一次编写，到处部署"的开发模式。

Method: 系统包含：语言特定的词法分析器/解析器将源代码转换为AST，双向CrossGL翻译模块（ToCrossGLConverter类用于导入代码，CodeGen类用于目标生成），以及处理完整翻译流程的后端实现。

Result: 通过跨编程领域的全面评估，在所有支持的后端上都实现了成功的编译和执行。统一的IR设计使得添加新语言只需开发语言特定的前后端组件。

Conclusion: CrossTL代表了向语言无关编程迈出的重要一步，证明了通用代码翻译的实际可行性，其模块化架构支持可扩展性，涵盖了GPU计算、图形编程和系统语言等多个领域。

Abstract: We present CrossTL, a universal programming language translator enabling
bidirectional translation between multiple languages through a unified
intermediate representation called CrossGL. Traditional approaches require
separate translators for each language pair, leading to exponential complexity
growth. CrossTL uses a single universal IR to facilitate translations between
CUDA, HIP, Metal, DirectX HLSL, OpenGL GLSL, Vulkan SPIR-V, Rust, and Mojo,
with Slang support in development. Our system consists of: language-specific
lexers/parsers converting source code to ASTs, bidirectional CrossGL
translation modules implementing ToCrossGLConverter classes for importing code
and CodeGen classes for target generation, and comprehensive backend
implementations handling full translation pipelines. We demonstrate
effectiveness through comprehensive evaluation across programming domains,
achieving successful compilation and execution across all supported backends.
The universal IR design enables adding new languages with minimal effort,
requiring only language-specific frontend/backend components. Our contributions
include: (1) a unified IR capturing semantics of multiple programming
paradigms, (2) a modular architecture enabling extensibility, (3) a
comprehensive framework supporting GPU compute, graphics programming, and
systems languages, and (4) empirical validation demonstrating practical
viability of universal code translation. CrossTL represents a significant step
toward language-agnostic programming, enabling write-once, deploy-everywhere
development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 误导性可视化是社交媒体和网络错误信息的重要来源，但缺乏大规模、多样化的公开数据集来训练和评估AI检测模型

Method: 创建了Misviz真实数据集和Misviz-synth合成数据集，使用最先进的多模态大语言模型、基于规则的系统以及微调分类器进行全面评估

Result: 研究结果显示检测误导性可视化仍然是一个极具挑战性的任务，现有模型表现有限

Conclusion: 发布了Misviz基准数据集和代码，为未来研究提供重要资源，有助于保护读者免受误导性可视化影响并减少错误信息传播

Abstract: Misleading visualizations are a potent driver of misinformation on social
media and the web. By violating chart design principles, they distort data and
lead readers to draw inaccurate conclusions. Prior work has shown that both
humans and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are frequently deceived by
such visualizations. Automatically detecting misleading visualizations and
identifying the specific design rules they violate could help protect readers
and reduce the spread of misinformation. However, the training and evaluation
of AI models has been limited by the absence of large, diverse, and openly
available datasets. In this work, we introduce Misviz, a benchmark of 2,604
real-world visualizations annotated with 12 types of misleaders. To support
model training, we also release Misviz-synth, a synthetic dataset of 81,814
visualizations generated using Matplotlib and based on real-world data tables.
We perform a comprehensive evaluation on both datasets using state-of-the-art
MLLMs, rule-based systems, and fine-tuned classifiers. Our results reveal that
the task remains highly challenging. We release Misviz, Misviz-synth, and the
accompanying code.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Percept-V数据集评估多模态大语言模型在基本视觉感知任务上的表现，发现随着任务复杂度增加，模型性能显著下降


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs在复杂任务上表现优异，但在简单视觉感知任务上的性能缺乏系统评估，需要测试模型对基本形状和结构的感知能力

Method: 创建包含7200张程序生成图像的Percept-V数据集，分为30个类别测试不同视觉感知技能，并在GPT-4o、Gemini、Claude等先进模型上进行测试

Result: 实验显示所有测试模型在复杂度增加时性能显著下降，不同类别表现趋势相似，某些认知技能比其他技能更难

Conclusion: MLLMs在基本视觉感知任务上存在明显局限性，需要进一步改进模型的底层视觉理解能力

Abstract: The reasoning abilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
garnered a lot of attention in recent times, with advances made in frontiers
like coding, mathematics, and science. However, very limited experiments have
been done to assess their performance in simple perception tasks performed over
uncontaminated, generated images containing basic shapes and structures. To
address this issue, the paper introduces a dataset, Percept-V, containing a
total of 7200 program-generated images equally divided into 30 categories, each
testing a combination of visual perception skills. Unlike previously proposed
datasets, Percept-V comprises very basic tasks of varying complexity that test
the perception abilities of MLLMs. This dataset is then tested on
state-of-the-art MLLMs like GPT-4o, Gemini, and Claude as well as Large
Reasoning Models (LRMs) like OpenAI o4-mini and DeepSeek R1 to gauge their
performance. Contrary to the evidence that MLLMs excel in many complex tasks,
our experiments show a significant drop in the models' performance with
increasing problem complexity across all categories. An analysis of the
performances also reveals that the tested MLLMs exhibit a similar trend in
accuracy across categories, testing a particular cognitive skill and find some
skills to be more difficult than others.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在医疗应用中需要高度准确、上下文敏感且专业对齐的响应，但缺乏专门针对医疗场景的奖励模型和评判器评估基准，现有基准主要关注通用能力或模型作为求解器的表现，忽略了诊断准确性和临床相关性等关键维度。

Method: 开发了Med-RewardBench基准，采用三步严格流程构建高质量评估数据集，包含1026个专家标注的多模态医疗案例，覆盖13个器官系统和8个临床科室，在六个临床关键维度上进行评估。

Result: 评估了32个最先进的多模态大语言模型（包括开源、专有和医疗专用模型），发现这些模型在输出与专家判断对齐方面存在显著挑战。开发的基线模型通过微调显示出显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: Med-RewardBench填补了医疗奖励模型评估的空白，揭示了当前MLLM在医疗场景中的对齐挑战，为开发更可靠的医疗AI系统提供了重要基准和方向。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold significant potential in
medical applications, including disease diagnosis and clinical decision-making.
However, these tasks require highly accurate, context-sensitive, and
professionally aligned responses, making reliable reward models and judges
critical. Despite their importance, medical reward models (MRMs) and judges
remain underexplored, with no dedicated benchmarks addressing clinical
requirements. Existing benchmarks focus on general MLLM capabilities or
evaluate models as solvers, neglecting essential evaluation dimensions like
diagnostic accuracy and clinical relevance. To address this, we introduce
Med-RewardBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate MRMs and
judges in medical scenarios. Med-RewardBench features a multimodal dataset
spanning 13 organ systems and 8 clinical departments, with 1,026
expert-annotated cases. A rigorous three-step process ensures high-quality
evaluation data across six clinically critical dimensions. We evaluate 32
state-of-the-art MLLMs, including open-source, proprietary, and
medical-specific models, revealing substantial challenges in aligning outputs
with expert judgment. Additionally, we develop baseline models that demonstrate
substantial performance improvements through fine-tuning.

TL;DR: 提出了QuadKAN框架，使用样条参数化的KAN网络结合本体感觉和视觉输入，通过MMDR和PPO训练，在多种地形上实现了更稳定、高效的视觉引导四足机器人运动控制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉引导四足运动控制问题，强调结合本体感觉和视觉对于鲁棒控制的必要性

Method: 提出QuadKAN框架，使用样条编码器处理本体感觉，样条融合头处理多模态输入，采用MMDR和PPO进行端到端训练

Result: 在多种地形（平坦/不平坦表面、静态/动态障碍物）上评估，相比SOTA基线获得更高回报、更远距离、更少碰撞

Conclusion: 样条参数化策略为鲁棒的视觉引导运动控制提供了简单、有效且可解释的替代方案

Abstract: We address vision-guided quadruped motion control with reinforcement learning
(RL) and highlight the necessity of combining proprioception with vision for
robust control. We propose QuadKAN, a spline-parameterized cross-modal policy
instantiated with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). The framework incorporates
a spline encoder for proprioception and a spline fusion head for
proprioception-vision inputs. This structured function class aligns the
state-to-action mapping with the piecewise-smooth nature of gait, improving
sample efficiency, reducing action jitter and energy consumption, and providing
interpretable posture-action sensitivities. We adopt Multi-Modal Delay
Randomization (MMDR) and perform end-to-end training with Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO). Evaluations across diverse terrains, including both even
and uneven surfaces and scenarios with static or dynamic obstacles, demonstrate
that QuadKAN achieves consistently higher returns, greater distances, and fewer
collisions than state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines. These results show that
spline-parameterized policies offer a simple, effective, and interpretable
alternative for robust vision-guided locomotion. A repository will be made
available upon acceptance.

Abstract: Autonomous driving applications have become increasingly relevant in the
automotive industry due to their potential to enhance vehicle safety,
efficiency, and user experience, thereby meeting the growing demand for
sophisticated driving assistance features. However, the development of reliable
and trustworthy autonomous systems poses challenges such as high complexity,
prolonged training periods, and intrinsic levels of uncertainty. Mini
Autonomous Cars (MACs) are used as a practical testbed, enabling validation of
autonomous control methodologies on small-scale setups. This simplified and
cost-effective environment facilitates rapid evaluation and comparison of
machine learning models, which is particularly useful for algorithms requiring
online training. To address these challenges, this work presents a methodology
based on RGB-D information and three-dimensional convolutional neural networks
(3D CNNs) for MAC autonomous driving in simulated environments. We evaluate the
proposed approach against recurrent neural networks (RNNs), with architectures
trained and tested on two simulated tracks with distinct environmental
features. Performance was assessed using task completion success, lap-time
metrics, and driving consistency. Results highlight how architectural
modifications and track complexity influence the models' generalization
capability and vehicle control performance. The proposed 3D CNN demonstrated
promising results when compared with RNNs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保深度学习模型在真实应用中的可靠性，需要有效区分训练分布内数据(ID)和分布外数据(OOD)，现有方法在处理不同分布偏移程度时存在局限性

Method: 使用奇异值分解分类头权重矩阵，将模型激活分解为决定性成分(对分类输出贡献最大)和无关成分(贡献最小)。在远分布偏移时使用无关成分，在近分布偏移时使用决定性成分

Result: 在各种标准OOD基准测试中取得了最先进的结果

Conclusion: 通过分析分类头权重矩阵的奇异值分解，可以更有效地识别不同分布偏移程度的OOD样本，ActSub方法在OOD检测任务中表现出色

Abstract: To ensure the reliability of deep models in real-world applications,
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods aim to distinguish samples close to
the training distribution (in-distribution, ID) from those farther away (OOD).
In this work, we propose a novel OOD detection method that utilizes singular
value decomposition of the weight matrix of the classification head to
decompose the model's activations into decisive and insignificant components,
which contribute maximally, respectively minimally, to the final classifier
output. We find that the subspace of insignificant components more effectively
distinguishes ID from OOD data than raw activations in regimes of large
distribution shifts (Far-OOD). This occurs because the classification objective
leaves the insignificant subspace largely unaffected, yielding features that
are ''untainted'' by the target classification task. Conversely, in regimes of
smaller distribution shifts (Near-OOD), we find that activation shaping methods
profit from only considering the decisive subspace, as the insignificant
component can cause interference in the activation space. By combining two
findings into a single approach, termed ActSub, we achieve state-of-the-art
results in various standard OOD benchmarks.

Motivation: 解决心率预测在实际部署中遇到的数据异质性问题，包括来自不同设备的源异质性和不同用户的用户异质性。

Method: 使用随机特征投弃策略处理源异质性，采用时间感知注意力模块和对比学习目标来处理用户异质性，学习与异质性无关的潜在表征。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效处理心率预测中的数据异质性问题，为个性化健康监测提供了实用价值。

Abstract: Heart rate prediction is vital for personalized health monitoring and
fitness, while it frequently faces a critical challenge when deploying in
real-world: data heterogeneity. We classify it in two key dimensions: source
heterogeneity from fragmented device markets with varying feature sets, and
user heterogeneity reflecting distinct physiological patterns across
individuals and activities. Existing methods either discard device-specific
information, or fail to model user-specific differences, limiting their
real-world performance. To address this, we propose a framework that learns
latent representations agnostic to both heterogeneity, enabling downstream
predictors to work consistently under heterogeneous data patterns.
Specifically, we introduce a random feature dropout strategy to handle source
heterogeneity, making the model robust to various feature sets. To manage user
heterogeneity, we employ a time-aware attention module to capture long-term
physiological traits and use a contrastive learning objective to build a
discriminative representation space. To reflect the heterogeneous nature of
real-world data, we created and publicly released a new benchmark dataset,
ParroTao. Evaluations on both ParroTao and the public FitRec dataset show that
our model significantly outperforms existing baselines by 17% and 15%,
respectively. Furthermore, analysis of the learned representations demonstrates
their strong discriminative power, and one downstream application task confirm
the practical value of our model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然知道磁重聚在磁重聚集不稳定性过程中发生，但其在不稳定性演化和能量动力学中的作用仍不明确，需要系统研究

Method: 使用高分辨率模拟进行二维磁重聚集不稳定性动力学分析，开发了自动化的磁重聚检测算法，并在不同磁场强度范围内进行统计分析

Result: 磁重聚通过促进突变融合、清除磁张力和支持不稳定性持续增长，在弱磁场区域负责近80%的磁能-动能转换，但对磁能耗散的贡献仅约3%

Conclusion: 磁重聚是调控大规模磁重聚集不稳定性动力学的关键机制，对天体物理等秒磁化流体中的混合过程具有重要意义

Abstract: Magnetic Rayleigh-Taylor instability (MRTI) governs material transport and
mixing in astrophysical and laboratory plasmas under the influence of gravity
and magnetic fields. While magnetic reconnection is known to occur during MRTI
evolution, its role in the evolution and energy dynamics remains poorly
understood. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of the role of
reconnection in the two-dimensional MRTI dynamics, using high-resolution
simulations. We establish that reconnection, through facilitating plume merger,
relieving magnetic tension, and enabling continued instability growth, forms an
essential component for the long-term instability evolution. To quantify the
role of reconnection in energy dynamics, we develop a robust automated
reconnection detection algorithm and perform a statistical analysis across a
range of magnetic field strengths. We find that reconnection accounts for up to
$80\%$ of the magnetic-to-kinetic energy transfer in the weak magnetic field
regime, while contributing minimally ($\approx 3\%$) to magnetic energy
dissipation. Our results establish magnetic reconnection as a critical
mechanism that regulates large-scale MRTI dynamics, with implications for
astrophysical plasmas and turbulent mixing in magnetized flows.
