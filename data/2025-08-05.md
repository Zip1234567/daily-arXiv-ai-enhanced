Abstract: Masked Face Recognition (MFR) is an increasingly important area in biometric
recognition technologies, especially with the widespread use of masks as a
result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This development has created new challenges
for facial recognition systems due to the partial concealment of basic facial
features. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the latest

changes in lighting, different facial positions, partial concealment, and the
impact of mask types on the performance of systems. It also reviews advanced
technologies developed to overcome these challenges, including data enhancement
using artificial databases and multimedia methods to improve the ability of
systems to generalize. In addition, the paper highlights advance in deep
network design, feature extraction techniques, evaluation criteria, and data
sets used in this area. Moreover, it reviews the various applications of masked
face recognition in the fields of security and medicine, highlighting the
growing importance of these systems in light of recurrent health crises and

### [3] [HoneyImage: Verifiable, Harmless, and Stealthy Dataset Ownership Verification for Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00892)
*Zhihao Zhu,Jiale Han,Yi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HoneyImage是一种用于图像识别模型数据集所有权验证的新方法，通过选择性修改少量困难样本嵌入可验证痕迹，实现可靠验证且保持数据完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像数据集常包含敏感或专有内容，现有解决方案在验证效果和数据完整性之间存在权衡，需要更可靠的机制验证数据是否被滥用。

Method: HoneyImage选择性修改少量困难样本，嵌入不可察觉但可验证的痕迹。

Result: 在四个基准数据集和多种模型架构上的实验表明，HoneyImage验证准确率高，对下游性能影响极小。

Conclusion: HoneyImage为数据所有者提供了一种实用的所有权保护机制，促进数据安全共享和AI潜力发挥。

Abstract: Image-based AI models are increasingly deployed across a wide range of
domains, including healthcare, security, and consumer applications. However,
many image datasets carry sensitive or proprietary content, raising critical
concerns about unauthorized data usage. Data owners therefore need reliable
mechanisms to verify whether their proprietary data has been misused to train
third-party models. Existing solutions, such as backdoor watermarking and
membership inference, face inherent trade-offs between verification
effectiveness and preservation of data integrity. In this work, we propose
HoneyImage, a novel method for dataset ownership verification in image
recognition models. HoneyImage selectively modifies a small number of hard
samples to embed imperceptible yet verifiable traces, enabling reliable
ownership verification while maintaining dataset integrity. Extensive
experiments across four benchmark datasets and multiple model architectures
show that HoneyImage consistently achieves strong verification accuracy with
minimal impact on downstream performance while maintaining imperceptible. The
proposed HoneyImage method could provide data owners with a practical mechanism
to protect ownership over valuable image datasets, encouraging safe sharing and
unlocking the full transformative potential of data-driven AI.

*Hoang Hai Nam Nguyen,Minh Tien Tran,Hoheok Kim,Ho Won Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PF-DiffSeg是一种基于相分数控制的单阶段去噪扩散框架，用于联合生成显微组织图像及其分割掩码，显著提高了分割精度，尤其在少数类别中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决金属合金显微组织分割中因缺乏人工标注相掩码（尤其是稀有或复杂形态）而导致的机器学习效果受限问题。

Method: 提出PF-DiffSeg框架，通过全局相分数向量控制生成过程，增强数据多样性和训练效率，生成结构一致的图像和掩码样本。

Result: 在MetalDAM基准测试中，该方法显著提升了分割精度（尤其是少数类别），且优于两阶段掩码引导扩散和GAN基线，同时减少了推理时间。

Conclusion: PF-DiffSeg将生成与条件控制统一为一个框架，为金相应用中的数据增强提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: The effectiveness of machine learning in metallographic microstructure
segmentation is often constrained by the lack of human-annotated phase masks,
particularly for rare or compositionally complex morphologies within the metal
alloy. We introduce PF-DiffSeg, a phase-fraction controlled, one-stage
denoising diffusion framework that jointly synthesizes microstructure images
and their corresponding segmentation masks in a single generative trajectory to
further improve segmentation accuracy. By conditioning on global phase-fraction
vectors, augmented to represent real data distribution and emphasize minority
classes, our model generates compositionally valid and structurally coherent
microstructure image and mask samples that improve both data diversity and
training efficiency. Evaluated on the MetalDAM benchmark for additively
manufactured multiphase steel, our synthetic augmentation method yields notable
improvements in segmentation accuracy compared to standard augmentation
strategies especially in minority classes and further outperforms a two-stage
mask-guided diffusion and generative adversarial network (GAN) baselines, while
also reducing inference time compared to conventional approach. The method
integrates generation and conditioning into a unified framework, offering a
scalable solution for data augmentation in metallographic applications.

### [5] [Benefits of Feature Extraction and Temporal Sequence Analysis for Video Frame Prediction: An Evaluation of Hybrid Deep Learning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00898)
*Jose M. Sánchez Velázquez,Mingbo Cai,Andrew Coney,Álvaro J. García- Tejedor,Alberto Nogales*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了结合自编码器和RNN、3D CNN等架构的混合深度学习方法，用于视频帧预测，结果表明3D CNN和ConvLSTM的混合模型效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频帧预测在天气预报和自动驾驶等领域有重要应用，但现有方法仍有改进空间。

Method: 采用自编码器提取特征，结合RNN、3D CNN等架构进行时序建模。

Result: 在三个数据集上测试，SSIM指标从0.69提升至0.82，3D CNN和ConvLSTM混合模型表现最优。

Conclusion: 混合模型在视频帧预测中效果显著，尤其是灰度视频和真实数据场景。

Abstract: In recent years, advances in Artificial Intelligence have significantly
impacted computer science, particularly in the field of computer vision,
enabling solutions to complex problems such as video frame prediction. Video
frame prediction has critical applications in weather forecasting or autonomous
systems and can provide technical improvements, such as video compression and
streaming. Among Artificial Intelligence methods, Deep Learning has emerged as
highly effective for solving vision-related tasks, although current frame
prediction models still have room for enhancement. This paper evaluates several
hybrid deep learning approaches that combine the feature extraction
capabilities of autoencoders with temporal sequence modelling using Recurrent
Neural Networks (RNNs), 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D CNNs), and related
architectures. The proposed solutions were rigorously evaluated on three
datasets that differ in terms of synthetic versus real-world scenarios and
grayscale versus color imagery. Results demonstrate that the approaches perform
well, with SSIM metrics increasing from 0.69 to 0.82, indicating that hybrid
models utilizing 3DCNNs and ConvLSTMs are the most effective, and greyscale
videos with real data are the easiest to predict.

### [6] [TESPEC: Temporally-Enhanced Self-Supervised Pretraining for Event Cameras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00913)
*Mohammad Mohammadi,Ziyi Wu,Igor Gilitschenski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TESPEC是一种自监督预训练框架，专为学习事件数据的时空信息设计，特别适合循环模型，并在多个下游任务中取得领先结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督学习方法忽略事件数据的长期时间信息，导致循环模型在预训练中表现不佳。

Method: 提出TESPEC框架，利用掩码图像建模范式，设计新重建目标，通过累积事件生成伪灰度视频。

Result: 在物体检测、语义分割和单目深度估计等任务中取得最优结果。

Conclusion: TESPEC通过利用长期事件序列预训练，显著提升了循环模型的性能。

Abstract: Long-term temporal information is crucial for event-based perception tasks,
as raw events only encode pixel brightness changes. Recent works show that when
trained from scratch, recurrent models achieve better results than feedforward
models in these tasks. However, when leveraging self-supervised pre-trained
weights, feedforward models can outperform their recurrent counterparts.
Current self-supervised learning (SSL) methods for event-based pre-training
largely mimic RGB image-based approaches. They pre-train feedforward models on
raw events within a short time interval, ignoring the temporal information of
events. In this work, we introduce TESPEC, a self-supervised pre-training
framework tailored for learning spatio-temporal information. TESPEC is
well-suited for recurrent models, as it is the first framework to leverage long
event sequences during pre-training. TESPEC employs the masked image modeling
paradigm with a new reconstruction target. We design a novel method to
accumulate events into pseudo grayscale videos containing high-level semantic
information about the underlying scene, which is robust to sensor noise and
reduces motion blur. Reconstructing this target thus requires the model to
reason about long-term history of events. Extensive experiments demonstrate our
state-of-the-art results in downstream tasks, including object detection,
semantic segmentation, and monocular depth estimation. Project webpage:

Abstract: Face recognition systems experience severe performance degradation when
processing low-quality forensic evidence imagery. This paper presents an
evaluation of latent diffusion-based enhancement for improving face recognition
under forensically relevant degradations. Using a dataset of 3,000 individuals
from LFW with 24,000 recognition attempts, we implement the Flux.1 Kontext Dev
pipeline with Facezoom LoRA adaptation to test against seven degradation
categories, including compression artefacts, blur effects, and noise
contamination. Our approach demonstrates substantial improvements, increasing
overall recognition accuracy from 29.1% to 84.5% (55.4 percentage point
improvement, 95% CI: [54.1, 56.7]). Statistical analysis reveals significant
performance gains across all degradation types, with effect sizes exceeding
conventional thresholds for practical significance. These findings establish
the potential of sophisticated diffusion based enhancement in forensic face
recognition applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决VLM中跨模态注意力机制不协调导致的注意力不匹配和性能不佳问题。

Method: 引入LPWCA捕获细粒度区域-语义关联，结合PAI系统协调多种注意力机制。

Result: 在10个基准测试中，CCRA增强的LLaVA-v1.5-7B模型达到SOTA性能，仅增加3.55M参数。

Conclusion: CCRA通过一致的跨层区域对齐，显著提升VLM性能并增强可解释性。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) face challenges in effectively coordinating
diverse attention mechanisms for cross-modal embedding learning, leading to
mismatched attention and suboptimal performance. We propose Consistent
Cross-layer Regional Alignment (CCRA), which introduces Layer-Patch-wise Cross
Attention (LPWCA) to capture fine-grained regional-semantic correlations by
jointly weighting patch and layer-wise embedding, and Progressive Attention
Integration (PAI) that systematically coordinates LPWCA, layer-wise, and
patch-wise attention mechanisms in sequence. This progressive design ensures
consistency from semantic to regional levels while preventing attention drift
and maximizing individual attention benefits. Experimental results on ten
diverse vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that our CCRA-enhanced
LLaVA-v1.5-7B model achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming all
baseline methods with only 3.55M additional parameters, while providing
enhanced interpretability through more regionally focused and semantically
aligned attention patterns.

Result: 结果表明，少量手动标注数据的微调可以显著提升深度学习网络的性能。

Conclusion: 自动标注与少量手动标注数据的结合，能够加速深度学习网络在新场景（如跑步机到自行车）中的适应。

Abstract: Infrared thermography is emerging as a powerful tool in sports medicine,
allowing assessment of thermal radiation during exercise and analysis of
anatomical regions of interest, such as the well-exposed calves. Building on
our previous advanced automatic annotation method, we aimed to transfer the
stereo- and multimodal-based labeling approach from treadmill running to
ergometer cycling. Therefore, the training of the semantic segmentation network
with automatic labels and fine-tuning on high-quality manually annotated images
has been examined and compared in different data set combinations. The results
indicate that fine-tuning with a small fraction of manual data is sufficient to
improve the overall performance of the deep neural network. Finally, combining
automatically generated labels with small manually annotated data sets
accelerates the adaptation of deep neural networks to new use cases, such as
the transition from treadmill to bicycle.

### [10] [ROVI: A VLM-LLM Re-Captioned Dataset for Open-Vocabulary Instance-Grounded Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01008)
*Cihang Peng,Qiming Hou,Zhong Ren,Kun Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ROVI是一个高质量的合成数据集，用于实例接地文本到图像生成，通过重新标注策略提升检测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有检测数据集在图像质量、分辨率和类别覆盖上的不足，提升文本到图像生成的实例接地准确性。

Method: 采用重新标注策略，结合VLM和LLM生成全局提示，优化OVDs的检测能力。

Result: ROVI在图像质量、分辨率和类别数量上优于现有数据集，GLIGEN模型在ROVI上训练后表现显著提升。

Conclusion: ROVI为文本到图像生成提供了更高质量的实例接地数据，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: We present ROVI, a high-quality synthetic dataset for instance-grounded
text-to-image generation, created by labeling 1M curated web images. Our key
innovation is a strategy called re-captioning, focusing on the pre-detection
stage, where a VLM (Vision-Language Model) generates comprehensive visual
descriptions that are then processed by an LLM (Large Language Model) to
extract a flat list of potential categories for OVDs (Open-Vocabulary
Detectors) to detect. This approach yields a global prompt inherently linked to
instance annotations while capturing secondary visual elements humans typically
overlook. Evaluations show that ROVI exceeds existing detection datasets in
image quality and resolution while containing two orders of magnitude more
categories with an open-vocabulary nature. For demonstrative purposes, a
text-to-image model GLIGEN trained on ROVI significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art alternatives in instance grounding accuracy, prompt fidelity,
and aesthetic quality. Our dataset and reproducible pipeline are available at
https://github.com/CihangPeng/ROVI.

### [11] [AutoSIGHT: Automatic Eye Tracking-based System for Immediate Grading of Human experTise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01015)
*Byron Dowling,Jozef Probcin,Adam Czajka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AutoSIGHT系统通过眼动追踪数据自动评估人类在视觉任务中的专业水平，分类专家与非专家，并在5秒评估窗口下AUROC达0.751，30秒窗口下提升至0.8306。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何通过眼动追踪特征自动评估人类在视觉任务中的专业水平，为动态调整人机协作中的专家分配提供依据。

Method: 提出AutoSIGHT系统，基于眼动追踪数据提取特征，采用集成方法分类专家与非专家。

Result: 在5秒评估窗口下AUROC为0.751，30秒窗口下提升至0.8306，表明模型能有效利用更多信息。

Conclusion: AutoSIGHT为动态人机协作中专家评估提供了可行方案，并公开了相关眼动追踪数据。

Abstract: Can we teach machines to assess the expertise of humans solving visual tasks
automatically based on eye tracking features? This paper proposes AutoSIGHT,
Automatic System for Immediate Grading of Human experTise, that classifies
expert and non-expert performers, and builds upon an ensemble of features
extracted from eye tracking data while the performers were solving a visual
task. Results on the task of iris Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) used for
this study show that with a small evaluation window of just 5 seconds,
AutoSIGHT achieves an average average Area Under the ROC curve performance of
0.751 in subject-disjoint train-test regime, indicating that such detection is
viable. Furthermore, when a larger evaluation window of up to 30 seconds is
available, the Area Under the ROC curve (AUROC) increases to 0.8306, indicating
the model is effectively leveraging more information at a cost of slightly
delayed decisions. This work opens new areas of research on how to incorporate
the automatic weighing of human and machine expertise into human-AI pairing
setups, which need to react dynamically to nonstationary expertise distribution
between the human and AI players (e.g. when the experts need to be replaced, or
the task at hand changes rapidly). Along with this paper, we offer the eye
tracking data used in this study collected from 6 experts and 53 non-experts
solving iris PAD visual task.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种增量式SfM方法，用于稀疏或部分重叠数据集的3D重建，并通过实验验证了其可靠性和实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决全局SfM技术在噪声或数据缺失情况下的局限性，提供更灵活的3D重建方法。

Method: 详细实现增量式SfM流程，关注几何估计一致性和通过束调整的迭代优化。

Result: 实验结果表明，增量式SfM在视觉结构化环境中是一种可靠的稀疏3D重建方法。

Conclusion: 增量式SfM适用于稀疏或部分重叠数据集，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction from unstructured image collections is a key
requirement in applications such as robotics, mapping, and scene understanding.
While global Structure from Motion (SfM) techniques rely on full image
connectivity and can be sensitive to noise or missing data, incremental SfM
offers a more flexible alternative. By progressively incorporating new views
into the reconstruction, it enables the system to recover scene structure and
camera motion even in sparse or partially overlapping datasets. In this paper,
we present a detailed implementation of the incremental SfM pipeline, focusing
on the consistency of geometric estimation and the effect of iterative
refinement through bundle adjustment. We demonstrate the approach using a real
dataset and assess reconstruction quality through reprojection error and camera
trajectory coherence. The results support the practical utility of incremental
SfM as a reliable method for sparse 3D reconstruction in visually structured
environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图的新方法，用于3D CT扫描的多标签分类，解决了现有方法在长距离依赖建模和高计算成本方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着CT扫描检查数量的增加，需要自动化方法来辅助放射科医生处理日益增加的工作量，但现有方法在建模长距离依赖和计算成本方面存在不足。

Method: 将CT扫描建模为结构化图，利用轴向切片三元组节点通过谱域卷积处理，以提升多标签异常分类性能。

Result: 该方法展示了强大的跨数据集泛化能力、竞争性性能以及对z轴平移的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过消融研究验证了各提出组件的贡献，证明了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: With the increasing number of CT scan examinations, there is a need for
automated methods such as organ segmentation, anomaly detection and report
generation to assist radiologists in managing their increasing workload.
Multi-label classification of 3D CT scans remains a critical yet challenging
task due to the complex spatial relationships within volumetric data and the
variety of observed anomalies. Existing approaches based on 3D convolutional
networks have limited abilities to model long-range dependencies while Vision
Transformers suffer from high computational costs and often require extensive
pre-training on large-scale datasets from the same domain to achieve
competitive performance. In this work, we propose an alternative by introducing
a new graph-based approach that models CT scans as structured graphs,
leveraging axial slice triplets nodes processed through spectral domain
convolution to enhance multi-label anomaly classification performance. Our
method exhibits strong cross-dataset generalization, and competitive
performance while achieving robustness to z-axis translation. An ablation study
evaluates the contribution of each proposed component.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一的规避框架，通过教师模型学习版权数据集并转移任务相关知识，利用Vision-Language和大型语言模型筛选最优子集，显著优于现有规避攻击方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集所有权验证（DOV）方法在评估中依赖过于简化的规避攻击，导致虚假的安全感。本文旨在揭示DOV方法的漏洞并提出更有效的规避策略。

Method: 提出统一规避框架，教师模型学习版权数据集后，通过OOD数据集转移任务相关知识，利用Vision-Language和大型语言模型筛选最优子集。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能消除所有版权标识符，在泛化性和有效性上显著优于九种现有规避攻击方法。

Conclusion: 揭示了当前DOV方法的关键漏洞，强调需长期发展以提升实用性。

Abstract: Modern over-parameterized deep models are highly data-dependent, with large
scale general-purpose and domain-specific datasets serving as the bedrock for
rapid advancements. However, many datasets are proprietary or contain sensitive
information, making unrestricted model training problematic. In the open world
where data thefts cannot be fully prevented, Dataset Ownership Verification
(DOV) has emerged as a promising method to protect copyright by detecting
unauthorized model training and tracing illicit activities. Due to its
diversity and superior stealth, evading DOV is considered extremely
challenging. However, this paper identifies that previous studies have relied
on oversimplistic evasion attacks for evaluation, leading to a false sense of
security. We introduce a unified evasion framework, in which a teacher model
first learns from the copyright dataset and then transfers task-relevant yet
identifier-independent domain knowledge to a surrogate student using an
out-of-distribution (OOD) dataset as the intermediary. Leveraging
Vision-Language Models and Large Language Models, we curate the most
informative and reliable subsets from the OOD gallery set as the final transfer
set, and propose selectively transferring task-oriented knowledge to achieve a
better trade-off between generalization and evasion effectiveness. Experiments
across diverse datasets covering eleven DOV methods demonstrate our approach
simultaneously eliminates all copyright identifiers and significantly
outperforms nine state-of-the-art evasion attacks in both generalization and
effectiveness, with moderate computational overhead. As a proof of concept, we
reveal key vulnerabilities in current DOV methods, highlighting the need for
long-term development to enhance practicality.

Abstract: To enhance asteroid exploration and autonomous spacecraft navigation, we
introduce DreamSat-2.0, a pipeline that benchmarks three state-of-the-art 3D
reconstruction models-Hunyuan-3D, Trellis-3D, and Ouroboros-3D-on custom
spacecraft and asteroid datasets. Our systematic analysis, using 2D perceptual
(image quality) and 3D geometric (shape accuracy) metrics, reveals that model
performance is domain-dependent. While models produce higher-quality images of
complex spacecraft, they achieve better geometric reconstructions for the
simpler forms of asteroids. New benchmarks are established, with Hunyuan-3D
achieving top perceptual scores on spacecraft but its best geometric accuracy
on asteroids, marking a significant advance over our prior work.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开放集识别方法依赖熟悉特征假设，忽略了衰减特征的作用，COSTARR旨在利用这些被忽视的信息。

Method: COSTARR结合熟悉特征和陌生特征的缺失，利用预衰减和衰减后的Hadamard乘积特征，并通过概率解释其得分。

Result: COSTARR在多种架构（ViTs、ConvNeXts、ResNet）和大规模数据集（如ImageNet2012-1K和NINCO）上表现优异，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: COSTARR通过利用衰减信息，显著提升了开放集识别的性能，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Handling novelty remains a key challenge in visual recognition systems.
Existing open-set recognition (OSR) methods rely on the familiarity hypothesis,
detecting novelty by the absence of familiar features. We propose a novel
attenuation hypothesis: small weights learned during training attenuate
features and serve a dual role-differentiating known classes while discarding
information useful for distinguishing known from unknown classes. To leverage
this overlooked information, we present COSTARR, a novel approach that combines
both the requirement of familiar features and the lack of unfamiliar ones. We
provide a probabilistic interpretation of the COSTARR score, linking it to the
likelihood of correct classification and belonging in a known class. To
determine the individual contributions of the pre- and post-attenuated features
to COSTARR's performance, we conduct ablation studies that show both
pre-attenuated deep features and the underutilized post-attenuated Hadamard
product features are essential for improving OSR. Also, we evaluate COSTARR in
a large-scale setting using ImageNet2012-1K as known data and NINCO,
iNaturalist, OpenImage-O, and other datasets as unknowns, across multiple
modern pre-trained architectures (ViTs, ConvNeXts, and ResNet). The experiments
demonstrate that COSTARR generalizes effectively across various architectures
and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods by incorporating
previously discarded attenuation information, advancing open-set recognition
capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Trans-Adapter是一种即插即用的适配器，使基于扩散的图像修复模型能够直接处理透明图像，解决了传统方法中透明度和边缘质量的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像修复方法仅适用于RGB图像，而透明图像修复通常需要两阶段处理（修复+抠图），导致透明度不一致和边缘锯齿问题。

Method: 提出Trans-Adapter适配器，支持直接处理RGBA图像，并可通过ControlNet实现可控编辑，兼容多种社区模型。

Result: 引入LayerBench和新的透明度边缘质量评估指标，实验证明Trans-Adapter在透明图像修复中的有效性。

Conclusion: Trans-Adapter解决了透明图像修复的挑战，为透明图像编辑提供了高效且一致的解决方案。

Abstract: RGBA images, with the additional alpha channel, are crucial for any
application that needs blending, masking, or transparency effects, making them
more versatile than standard RGB images. Nevertheless, existing image
inpainting methods are designed exclusively for RGB images. Conventional
approaches to transparent image inpainting typically involve placing a
background underneath RGBA images and employing a two-stage process: image
inpainting followed by image matting. This pipeline, however, struggles to
preserve transparency consistency in edited regions, and matting can introduce
jagged edges along transparency boundaries. To address these challenges, we
propose Trans-Adapter, a plug-and-play adapter that enables diffusion-based
inpainting models to process transparent images directly. Trans-Adapter also
supports controllable editing via ControlNet and can be seamlessly integrated
into various community models. To evaluate our method, we introduce LayerBench,
along with a novel non-reference alpha edge quality evaluation metric for
assessing transparency edge quality. We conduct extensive experiments on
LayerBench to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖预定义材料先验，限制了处理未知材料的能力。

Method: MASIV采用可学习的神经本构模型，并通过重建连续粒子轨迹提供密集几何指导。

Result: MASIV在几何精度、渲染质量和泛化能力上达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: MASIV解决了材料无关系统识别的挑战，提供了更灵活和准确的解决方案。

Abstract: System identification from videos aims to recover object geometry and
governing physical laws. Existing methods integrate differentiable rendering
with simulation but rely on predefined material priors, limiting their ability
to handle unknown ones. We introduce MASIV, the first vision-based framework
for material-agnostic system identification. Unlike existing approaches that
depend on hand-crafted constitutive laws, MASIV employs learnable neural
constitutive models, inferring object dynamics without assuming a
scene-specific material prior. However, the absence of full particle state
information imposes unique challenges, leading to unstable optimization and
physically implausible behaviors. To address this, we introduce dense geometric
guidance by reconstructing continuum particle trajectories, providing
temporally rich motion constraints beyond sparse visual cues. Comprehensive
experiments show that MASIV achieves state-of-the-art performance in geometric
accuracy, rendering quality, and generalization ability.

Result: EARL模型在多种编辑任务中表现优异，且训练数据需求较少。

Conclusion: EARL推动了自回归多模态模型在图像编辑领域的前沿，并开源了代码和数据。

Abstract: We explore three strategies to enhance performance on a wide range of image
editing tasks: supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reinforcement learning (RL), and
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. In order to study all these components in one
consistent framework, we adopt an autoregressive multimodal model that
processes textual and visual tokens in a unified manner. We find RL combined
with a large multi-modal LLM verifier to be the most effective of these
strategies. As a result, we release EARL: Editing with Autoregression and RL, a
strong RL-based image editing model that performs competitively on a diverse
range of edits compared to strong baselines, despite using much less training
data. Thus, EARL pushes the frontier of autoregressive multimodal models on
image editing. We release our code, training data, and trained models at

Result: UniEgoMotion在运动重建和生成任务中表现优异，首次实现从单张图像生成运动。

Conclusion: UniEgoMotion为第一人称运动建模设定了新基准，拓展了相关应用的可能性。

Abstract: Egocentric human motion generation and forecasting with scene-context is
crucial for enhancing AR/VR experiences, improving human-robot interaction,
advancing assistive technologies, and enabling adaptive healthcare solutions by
accurately predicting and simulating movement from a first-person perspective.
However, existing methods primarily focus on third-person motion synthesis with
structured 3D scene contexts, limiting their effectiveness in real-world
egocentric settings where limited field of view, frequent occlusions, and
dynamic cameras hinder scene perception. To bridge this gap, we introduce
Egocentric Motion Generation and Egocentric Motion Forecasting, two novel tasks
that utilize first-person images for scene-aware motion synthesis without
relying on explicit 3D scene. We propose UniEgoMotion, a unified conditional
motion diffusion model with a novel head-centric motion representation tailored
for egocentric devices. UniEgoMotion's simple yet effective design supports
egocentric motion reconstruction, forecasting, and generation from first-person
visual inputs in a unified framework. Unlike previous works that overlook scene
semantics, our model effectively extracts image-based scene context to infer
plausible 3D motion. To facilitate training, we introduce EE4D-Motion, a
large-scale dataset derived from EgoExo4D, augmented with pseudo-ground-truth
3D motion annotations. UniEgoMotion achieves state-of-the-art performance in
egocentric motion reconstruction and is the first to generate motion from a
single egocentric image. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of
our unified framework, setting a new benchmark for egocentric motion modeling
and unlocking new possibilities for egocentric applications.

Motivation: 解决大规模数据、过拟合和类别不平衡等问题，特别是在脑MRI异常检测中的应用。

Method: 结合深度强化学习与特征表示，处理标签稀缺和大规模数据问题，预处理包括归一化、去颅骨和配准。

Result: 在脑MRI数据集上AUROC达88.7%（像素级）和96.7%（图像级），工业数据集上表现同样出色。

Conclusion: 该方法具有鲁棒性、泛化能力和高效性，适用于临床和工业领域的异常检测。

Abstract: To develop a domain-agnostic, semi-supervised anomaly detection framework
that integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to address challenges such as
large-scale data, overfitting, and class imbalance, focusing on brain MRI
volumes. This retrospective study used publicly available brain MRI datasets
collected between 2005 and 2021. The IXI dataset provided 581 T1-weighted and
578 T2-weighted MRI volumes (from healthy subjects) for training, while the
BraTS 2021 dataset provided 251 volumes for validation and 1000 for testing
(unhealthy subjects with Glioblastomas). Preprocessing included normalization,
skull-stripping, and co-registering to a uniform voxel size. Experiments were
conducted on both T1- and T2-weighted modalities. Additional experiments and
ablation analyses were also carried out on the industrial datasets. The
proposed method integrates DRL with feature representations to handle label
scarcity, large-scale data and overfitting. Statistical analysis was based on
several detection and segmentation metrics including AUROC and Dice score. The
proposed method achieved an AUROC of 88.7% (pixel-level) and 96.7%
(image-level) on brain MRI datasets, outperforming State-of-The-Art (SOTA)
methods. On industrial surface datasets, the model also showed competitive
performance (AUROC = 99.8% pixel-level, 99.3% image-level) on MVTec AD dataset,
indicating strong cross-domain generalization. Studies on anomaly sample size
showed a monotonic increase in AUROC as more anomalies were seen, without
evidence of overfitting or additional computational cost. The domain-agnostic
semi-supervised approach using DRL shows significant promise for MRI anomaly
detection, achieving strong performance on both medical and industrial
datasets. Its robustness, generalizability and efficiency highlight its
potential for real-world clinical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集压缩方法在极端压缩下难以平衡性能和保真度，且忽视了颜色作为信息载体和语义单元的双重作用。

Method: DC3结合校准选择策略和潜在扩散模型，增强图像颜色多样性而非生成全新图像。

Result: DC3在多个基准测试中优于现有方法，且首次利用预训练扩散模型微调压缩数据集。

Conclusion: DC3通过颜色补偿显著提升了数据集压缩的质量和泛化能力，避免了模型崩溃等问题。

Abstract: Dataset condensation always faces a constitutive trade-off: balancing
performance and fidelity under extreme compression. Existing methods struggle
with two bottlenecks: image-level selection methods (Coreset Selection, Dataset
Quantization) suffer from inefficiency condensation, while pixel-level
optimization (Dataset Distillation) introduces semantic distortion due to
over-parameterization. With empirical observations, we find that a critical
problem in dataset condensation is the oversight of color's dual role as an
information carrier and a basic semantic representation unit. We argue that
improving the colorfulness of condensed images is beneficial for representation
learning. Motivated by this, we propose DC3: a Dataset Condensation framework
with Color Compensation. After a calibrated selection strategy, DC3 utilizes
the latent diffusion model to enhance the color diversity of an image rather
than creating a brand-new one. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior
performance and generalization of DC3 that outperforms SOTA methods across
multiple benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, besides focusing on
downstream tasks, DC3 is the first research to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion
models with condensed datasets. The FID results prove that training networks
with our high-quality datasets is feasible without model collapse or other
degradation issues. Code and generated data will be released soon.

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D scene understanding have made significant strides
in enabling interaction with scenes using open-vocabulary queries, particularly
for VR/AR and robotic applications. Nevertheless, existing methods are hindered
by rigid offline pipelines and the inability to provide precise 3D object-level
understanding given open-ended queries. In this paper, we present
OpenGS-Fusion, an innovative open-vocabulary dense mapping framework that
improves semantic modeling and refines object-level understanding.
OpenGS-Fusion combines 3D Gaussian representation with a Truncated Signed
Distance Field to facilitate lossless fusion of semantic features on-the-fly.
Furthermore, we introduce a novel multimodal language-guided approach named
MLLM-Assisted Adaptive Thresholding, which refines the segmentation of 3D
objects by adaptively adjusting similarity thresholds, achieving an improvement
17\% in 3D mIoU compared to the fixed threshold strategy. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in 3D object
understanding and scene reconstruction quality, as well as showcasing its
effectiveness in language-guided scene interaction. The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合深度学习与G-PCC标准的新型预处理框架，显著提升了压缩效率，同时保持了兼容性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: G-PCC标准虽然通用且低功耗，但压缩效率不及深度学习方法。研究旨在提升其效率而不牺牲兼容性。

Method: 集成压缩导向的体素化网络与可微G-PCC替代模型，联合优化训练。替代模型模拟G-PCC的率失真行为，支持端到端梯度传播。

Result: 实验显示平均BD-rate降低38.84%，且无需修改解码器，无额外计算开销。

Conclusion: 该框架为提升传统压缩标准提供了实用路径，保持向后兼容性，适合实际部署。

Abstract: Geometry-based point cloud compression (G-PCC), an international standard
designed by MPEG, provides a generic framework for compressing diverse types of
point clouds while ensuring interoperability across applications and devices.
However, G-PCC underperforms compared to recent deep learning-based PCC methods
despite its lower computational power consumption. To enhance the efficiency of
G-PCC without sacrificing its interoperability or computational flexibility, we
propose a novel preprocessing framework that integrates a compression-oriented
voxelization network with a differentiable G-PCC surrogate model, jointly
optimized in the training phase. The surrogate model mimics the rate-distortion
behaviour of the non-differentiable G-PCC codec, enabling end-to-end gradient
propagation. The versatile voxelization network adaptively transforms input
point clouds using learning-based voxelization and effectively manipulates
point clouds via global scaling, fine-grained pruning, and point-level editing
for rate-distortion trade-offs. During inference, only the lightweight
voxelization network is appended to the G-PCC encoder, requiring no
modifications to the decoder, thus introducing no computational overhead for
end users. Extensive experiments demonstrate a 38.84% average BD-rate reduction
over G-PCC. By bridging classical codecs with deep learning, this work offers a
practical pathway to enhance legacy compression standards while preserving
their backward compatibility, making it ideal for real-world deployment.

Result: PSA在有害内容抑制和用户约束对齐方面表现优异，Win Rate和Pass Rate得分更高。

Conclusion: PSA有效实现个性化安全控制，同时保持图像质量，代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have revolutionized visual content generation,
but current safety mechanisms apply uniform standards that often fail to
account for individual user preferences. These models overlook the diverse
safety boundaries shaped by factors like age, mental health, and personal
beliefs. To address this, we propose Personalized Safety Alignment (PSA), a
framework that allows user-specific control over safety behaviors in generative
models. PSA integrates personalized user profiles into the diffusion process,
adjusting the model's behavior to match individual safety preferences while
preserving image quality. We introduce a new dataset, Sage, which captures
user-specific safety preferences and incorporates these profiles through a
cross-attention mechanism. Experiments show that PSA outperforms existing
methods in harmful content suppression and aligns generated content better with
user constraints, achieving higher Win Rate and Pass Rate scores. Our code,
data, and models are publicly available at

Motivation: 解决现有二分图像分割方法在用户控制和个性化应用中的不足。

Method: 结合语言控制的初始分割（LS）和窗口控制的细化（WR）策略，通过潜在扩散模型实现。

Result: 在DIS5K基准测试中显著优于11种先进方法，Fβω提升4.6%。

Conclusion: LawDIS框架在用户控制和精度方面表现出色，适用于高精度个性化应用。

Abstract: We present LawDIS, a language-window-based controllable dichotomous image
segmentation (DIS) framework that produces high-quality object masks. Our
framework recasts DIS as an image-conditioned mask generation task within a
latent diffusion model, enabling seamless integration of user controls. LawDIS
is enhanced with macro-to-micro control modes. Specifically, in macro mode, we
introduce a language-controlled segmentation strategy (LS) to generate an
initial mask based on user-provided language prompts. In micro mode, a
window-controlled refinement strategy (WR) allows flexible refinement of
user-defined regions (i.e., size-adjustable windows) within the initial mask.
Coordinated by a mode switcher, these modes can operate independently or
jointly, making the framework well-suited for high-accuracy, personalised
applications. Extensive experiments on the DIS5K benchmark reveal that our
LawDIS significantly outperforms 11 cutting-edge methods across all metrics.
Notably, compared to the second-best model MVANet, we achieve $F_\beta^\omega$
gains of 4.6\% with both the LS and WR strategies and 3.6\% gains with only the
LS strategy on DIS-TE. Codes will be made available at

Conclusion: TEACH是一种无需外部预训练、无推理开销的模型无关方法，可无缝集成到现有框架中，具有鲁棒性和广泛适用性。

Abstract: Scene Text Recognition (STR) remains a challenging task due to complex visual
appearances and limited semantic priors. We propose TEACH, a novel training
paradigm that injects ground-truth text into the model as auxiliary input and
progressively reduces its influence during training. By encoding target labels
into the embedding space and applying loss-aware masking, TEACH simulates a
curriculum learning process that guides the model from label-dependent learning
to fully visual recognition. Unlike language model-based approaches, TEACH
requires no external pretraining and introduces no inference overhead. It is
model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing encoder-decoder
frameworks. Extensive experiments across multiple public benchmarks show that
models trained with TEACH achieve consistently improved accuracy, especially
under challenging conditions, validating its robustness and general

Result: 算法实现了5-100倍的加速，同时保持了最先进的跟踪精度。

Conclusion: 新算法显著提升了计算效率，适用于大规模3D点跟踪任务。

Abstract: We propose a novel algorithm for accelerating dense long-term 3D point
tracking in videos. Through analysis of existing state-of-the-art methods, we
identify two major computational bottlenecks. First, transformer-based
iterative tracking becomes expensive when handling a large number of
trajectories. To address this, we introduce a coarse-to-fine strategy that
begins tracking with a small subset of points and progressively expands the set
of tracked trajectories. The newly added trajectories are initialized using a
learnable interpolation module, which is trained end-to-end alongside the
tracking network. Second, we propose an optimization that significantly reduces
the cost of correlation feature computation, another key bottleneck in prior
methods. Together, these improvements lead to a 5-100x speedup over existing
approaches while maintaining state-of-the-art tracking accuracy.

TL;DR: DeflareMamba利用状态空间模型高效序列建模能力，提出分层框架解决镜头光晕去除问题，保持局部-全局依赖关系，实验证明其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 镜头光晕去除因光与镜头复杂交互导致信息混淆，现有方法难以保持上下文一致性。

Method: 设计分层框架，通过变步长采样建立长距离像素关联，并利用局部增强状态空间模型保留细节。

Result: 有效去除多种光晕伪影，保持非光晕区域自然外观，提升下游视觉任务性能。

Conclusion: 首次将状态空间模型引入光晕去除任务，实验证明其优越性。

Abstract: Lens flare removal remains an information confusion challenge in the
underlying image background and the optical flares, due to the complex optical
interactions between light sources and camera lens. While recent solutions have
shown promise in decoupling the flare corruption from image, they often fail to
maintain contextual consistency, leading to incomplete and inconsistent flare
removal. To eliminate this limitation, we propose DeflareMamba, which leverages
the efficient sequence modeling capabilities of state space models while
maintains the ability to capture local-global dependencies. Particularly, we
design a hierarchical framework that establishes long-range pixel correlations
through varied stride sampling patterns, and utilize local-enhanced state space
models that simultaneously preserves local details. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work that introduces state space models to the
flare removal task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
effectively removes various types of flare artifacts, including scattering and
reflective flares, while maintaining the natural appearance of non-flare
regions. Further downstream applications demonstrate the capacity of our method
to improve visual object recognition and cross-modal semantic understanding.

Motivation: 解决多视角图像稀疏且无真实姿态信息时的3D重建问题，提升实用性和效率。

Method: 采用共享特征提取主干网络，同时预测3D高斯基元和相机姿态，结合渲染损失和重投影损失优化几何约束。

Result: 在无姿态监督下，SPFSplat在新视角合成和相对姿态估计中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: SPFSplat的免姿态训练和高效设计使其适用于实际应用，性能优越。

Abstract: We introduce SPFSplat, an efficient framework for 3D Gaussian splatting from
sparse multi-view images, requiring no ground-truth poses during training or
inference. It employs a shared feature extraction backbone, enabling
simultaneous prediction of 3D Gaussian primitives and camera poses in a
canonical space from unposed inputs within a single feed-forward step.
Alongside the rendering loss based on estimated novel-view poses, a
reprojection loss is integrated to enforce the learning of pixel-aligned
Gaussian primitives for enhanced geometric constraints. This pose-free training
paradigm and efficient one-step feed-forward design make SPFSplat well-suited
for practical applications. Remarkably, despite the absence of pose
supervision, SPFSplat achieves state-of-the-art performance in novel view
synthesis even under significant viewpoint changes and limited image overlap.

Abstract: A core problem of Embodied AI is to learn object manipulation from
observation, as humans do. To achieve this, it is important to localize 3D
object affordance areas through observation such as images (3D affordance
grounding) and understand their functionalities (affordance classification).
Previous attempts usually tackle these two tasks separately, leading to
inconsistent predictions due to lacking proper modeling of their dependency. In
addition, these methods typically only ground the incomplete affordance areas
depicted in images, failing to predict the full potential affordance areas, and
operate at a fixed scale, resulting in difficulty in coping with affordances
significantly varying in scale with respect to the whole object. To address
these issues, we propose a novel approach that learns an affordance-aware 3D
representation and employs a stage-wise inference strategy leveraging the
dependency between grounding and classification tasks. Specifically, we first
develop a cross-modal 3D representation through efficient fusion and
multi-scale geometric feature propagation, enabling inference of full potential
affordance areas at a suitable regional scale. Moreover, we adopt a simple
two-stage prediction mechanism, effectively coupling grounding and
classification for better affordance understanding. Experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method, showing improved performance in both affordance
grounding and classification.

Abstract: Recently convolutional sparse representation (CSR), as a sparse
representation technique, has attracted increasing attention in the field of
image processing, due to its good characteristic of translate-invariance. The
content of CSR usually consists of convolutional sparse coding (CSC) and
convolutional dictionary learning (CDL), and many studies focus on how to solve
the corresponding optimization problems. At present, the most efficient
optimization scheme for CSC is based on the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM). However, the ADMM-based approach involves a penalty
parameter that needs to be carefully selected, and improper parameter selection
may result in either no convergence or very slow convergence. In this paper, a
novel fast and efficient method using Chambolle-Pock(CP) framework is proposed,
which does not require extra manual selection parameters in solving processing,
and has faster convergence speed. Furthermore, we propose an anisotropic total
variation penalty of the coefficient maps for CSC and apply the CP algorithm to
solve it. In addition, we also apply the CP framework to solve the
corresponding CDL problem. Experiments show that for noise-free image the
proposed CSC algorithms can achieve rival results of the latest ADMM-based
approach, while outperforms in removing noise from Gaussian noise pollution
image.

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，模型性能优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 3D占用标注和GroundingOcc模型显著提升了视觉定位的精确性。

Abstract: Visual grounding aims to identify objects or regions in a scene based on
natural language descriptions, essential for spatially aware perception in
autonomous driving. However, existing visual grounding tasks typically depend
on bounding boxes that often fail to capture fine-grained details. Not all
voxels within a bounding box are occupied, resulting in inaccurate object
representations. To address this, we introduce a benchmark for 3D occupancy
grounding in challenging outdoor scenes. Built on the nuScenes dataset, it
integrates natural language with voxel-level occupancy annotations, offering
more precise object perception compared to the traditional grounding task.
Moreover, we propose GroundingOcc, an end-to-end model designed for 3D
occupancy grounding through multi-modal learning. It combines visual, textual,
and point cloud features to predict object location and occupancy information
from coarse to fine. Specifically, GroundingOcc comprises a multimodal encoder
for feature extraction, an occupancy head for voxel-wise predictions, and a
grounding head to refine localization. Additionally, a 2D grounding module and
a depth estimation module enhance geometric understanding, thereby boosting
model performance. Extensive experiments on the benchmark demonstrate that our
method outperforms existing baselines on 3D occupancy grounding. The dataset is
available at https://github.com/RONINGOD/GroundingOcc.

Abstract: Civil infrastructure systems covers large land areas and needs frequent
inspections to maintain their public service capabilities. The conventional
approaches of manual surveys or vehicle-based automated surveys to assess
infrastructure conditions are often labor-intensive and time-consuming. For
this reason, it is worthwhile to explore more cost-effective methods for
monitoring and maintaining these infrastructures. Fortunately, recent
advancements in satellite systems and image processing algorithms have opened
up new possibilities. Numerous satellite systems have been employed to monitor
infrastructure conditions and identify damages. Due to the improvement in
ground sample distance (GSD), the level of detail that can be captured has
significantly increased. Taking advantage of these technology advancement, this
research investigated to evaluate pavement conditions using deep learning
models for analyzing satellite images. We gathered over 3,000 satellite images
of pavement sections, together with pavement evaluation ratings from TxDOT's
PMIS database. The results of our study show an accuracy rate is exceeding 90%.
This research paves the way for a rapid and cost-effective approach to
evaluating the pavement network in the future.

Motivation: 基于视觉技术提前获取道路表面条件可为自动驾驶车辆的规划与控制系统提供有效信息，提升安全性和驾驶舒适性。现有Mamba架构在视觉任务中表现优异，但缺乏对道路表面局部纹理的有效提取。

Method: 提出RoadMamba方法，利用DualSSM提取全局语义和局部纹理，通过DAF解码和融合双特征，并引入双辅助损失约束网络。

Result: 在包含100万样本的大规模道路表面分类数据集上，RoadMamba取得了最优性能。

Conclusion: RoadMamba通过结合局部和全局感知，有效提升了道路表面分类的准确性，为自动驾驶系统提供了更可靠的信息。

Abstract: Acquiring the road surface conditions in advance based on visual technologies
provides effective information for the planning and control system of
autonomous vehicles, thus improving the safety and driving comfort of the
vehicles. Recently, the Mamba architecture based on state-space models has
shown remarkable performance in visual processing tasks, benefiting from the
efficient global receptive field. However, existing Mamba architectures
struggle to achieve state-of-the-art visual road surface classification due to
their lack of effective extraction of the local texture of the road surface. In
this paper, we explore for the first time the potential of visual Mamba
architectures for road surface classification task and propose a method that
effectively combines local and global perception, called RoadMamba.
Specifically, we utilize the Dual State Space Model (DualSSM) to effectively
extract the global semantics and local texture of the road surface and decode
and fuse the dual features through the Dual Attention Fusion (DAF). In
addition, we propose a dual auxiliary loss to explicitly constrain dual
branches, preventing the network from relying only on global semantic
information from the deep large receptive field and ignoring the local texture.
The proposed RoadMamba achieves the state-of-the-art performance in experiments
on a large-scale road surface classification dataset containing 1 million
samples.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StyDeco提出了一种无监督框架，通过定制化的文本表示解决扩散模型在风格迁移中的语义鸿沟问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型将文本描述视为统一指导，忽略了文本描述的非空间性与视觉风格的空间属性之间的语义差距，导致风格化过程中语义结构和细节丢失。

Method: 框架包括Prior-Guided Data Distillation（PGD）和Contrastive Semantic Decoupling（CSD），前者通过冻结生成模型合成伪配对数据，后者通过域特定权重调整文本编码器。

Result: 在三个经典基准测试中，StyDeco在风格保真度和结构保留方面优于现有方法，并支持去风格化过程。

Conclusion: StyDeco有效解决了风格迁移中的语义保留问题，展示了其扩展性和实用性。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as the dominant paradigm for style transfer,
but their text-driven mechanism is hindered by a core limitation: it treats
textual descriptions as uniform, monolithic guidance. This limitation overlooks
the semantic gap between the non-spatial nature of textual descriptions and the
spatially-aware attributes of visual style, often leading to the loss of
semantic structure and fine-grained details during stylization. In this paper,
we propose StyDeco, an unsupervised framework that resolves this limitation by
learning text representations specifically tailored for the style transfer
task. Our framework first employs Prior-Guided Data Distillation (PGD), a
strategy designed to distill stylistic knowledge without human supervision. It
leverages a powerful frozen generative model to automatically synthesize
pseudo-paired data. Subsequently, we introduce Contrastive Semantic Decoupling
(CSD), a task-specific objective that adapts a text encoder using
domain-specific weights. CSD performs a two-class clustering in the semantic
space, encouraging source and target representations to form distinct clusters.
Extensive experiments on three classic benchmarks demonstrate that our
framework outperforms several existing approaches in both stylistic fidelity
and structural preservation, highlighting its effectiveness in style transfer
with semantic preservation. In addition, our framework supports a unique
de-stylization process, further demonstrating its extensibility. Our code is
vailable at https://github.com/QuanjianSong/StyDeco.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于楼层平面图包含大量重复结构（如走廊和角落），现有方法依赖2D结构匹配或3D几何约束，忽略了视觉图像提供的丰富上下文信息。本文旨在利用场景布局先验消除定位不确定性。

Method: 提出一种无监督学习技术，通过聚类约束预训练房间判别器，提取隐藏的房间类型信息，并将其注入FLoc算法中，利用场景上下文指导定位。

Result: 在两个标准FLoc基准测试中，该方法优于现有技术，显著提升了鲁棒性和准确性。

Conclusion: 通过引入视觉场景上下文信息，该方法有效解决了FLoc中的定位模糊问题，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Since a building's floorplan remains consistent over time and is inherently
robust to changes in visual appearance, visual Floorplan Localization (FLoc)
has received increasing attention from researchers. However, as a compact and
minimalist representation of the building's layout, floorplans contain many
repetitive structures (e.g., hallways and corners), thus easily result in
ambiguous localization. Existing methods either pin their hopes on matching 2D
structural cues in floorplans or rely on 3D geometry-constrained visual
pre-trainings, ignoring the richer contextual information provided by visual
images. In this paper, we suggest using broader visual scene context to empower
FLoc algorithms with scene layout priors to eliminate localization uncertainty.
In particular, we propose an unsupervised learning technique with clustering
constraints to pre-train a room discriminator on self-collected unlabeled room
images. Such a discriminator can empirically extract the hidden room type of
the observed image and distinguish it from other room types. By injecting the
scene context information summarized by the discriminator into an FLoc
algorithm, the room style knowledge is effectively exploited to guide definite
visual FLoc. We conducted sufficient comparative studies on two standard visual
Floc benchmarks. Our experiments show that our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art methods and achieves significant improvements in robustness
and accuracy.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖FLAME网格和基于高斯的渲染，但网格与目标图像的不对齐导致渲染质量下降和细节丢失。

Result: 实验表明，MoGaFace能实现高保真头部化身重建，并显著提升新视角合成质量。

Conclusion: MoGaFace在网格初始化和真实场景中表现优异，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Existing 3D head avatar reconstruction methods adopt a two-stage process,
relying on tracked FLAME meshes derived from facial landmarks, followed by
Gaussian-based rendering. However, misalignment between the estimated mesh and
target images often leads to suboptimal rendering quality and loss of fine
visual details. In this paper, we present MoGaFace, a novel 3D head avatar
modeling framework that continuously refines facial geometry and texture
attributes throughout the Gaussian rendering process. To address the
misalignment between estimated FLAME meshes and target images, we introduce the
Momentum-Guided Consistent Geometry module, which incorporates a
momentum-updated expression bank and an expression-aware correction mechanism
to ensure temporal and multi-view consistency. Additionally, we propose Latent
Texture Attention, which encodes compact multi-view features into head-aware
representations, enabling geometry-aware texture refinement via integration
into Gaussians. Extensive experiments show that MoGaFace achieves high-fidelity
head avatar reconstruction and significantly improves novel-view synthesis
quality, even under inaccurate mesh initialization and unconstrained real-world
settings.

Motivation: 深度神经网络（DNN）的梯度优化过程常导致权重结构混乱，损害特征清晰性和学习动态。

Method: ENN通过层共享的学习正交特征基重新参数化权重，强制权重动态解耦和对齐，无需正则化。

Result: ENN在ImageNet等大规模图像分类任务中表现优异，并在跨模态图像-文本检索中创下新基准。其变体ENN-ℓ实现了无反向传播的高效本地学习，训练速度提升2倍以上且精度更高。

Conclusion: ENN通过直接解决反向传播的表示缺陷，提供了一种性能更强、训练更高效的架构范式。

Abstract: The remarkable success of Deep Neural Networks(DNN) is driven by
gradient-based optimization, yet this process is often undermined by its
tendency to produce disordered weight structures, which harms feature clarity
and degrades learning dynamics. To address this fundamental representational
flaw, we introduced the Eigen Neural Network (ENN), a novel architecture that
reparameterizes each layer's weights in a layer-shared, learned orthonormal
eigenbasis. This design enforces decorrelated, well-aligned weight dynamics
axiomatically, rather than through regularization, leading to more structured
and discriminative feature representations. When integrated with standard BP,
ENN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on large-scale image
classification benchmarks, including ImageNet, and its superior representations
generalize to set a new benchmark in cross-modal image-text retrieval.
Furthermore, ENN's principled structure enables a highly efficient,
backpropagation-free(BP-free) local learning variant, ENN-$\ell$. This variant
not only resolves BP's procedural bottlenecks to achieve over 2$\times$
training speedup via parallelism, but also, remarkably, surpasses the accuracy
of end-to-end backpropagation. ENN thus presents a new architectural paradigm
that directly remedies the representational deficiencies of BP, leading to
enhanced performance and enabling a more efficient, parallelizable training
regime.

Conclusion: ParaRevSNN适合资源受限场景，兼具高效和低延迟。

Abstract: Reversible Spiking Neural Networks (RevSNNs) enable memory-efficient training
by reconstructing forward activations during backpropagation, but suffer from
high latency due to strictly sequential computation. To overcome this
limitation, we propose ParaRevSNN, a parallel reversible SNN architecture that
decouples sequential dependencies between reversible blocks while preserving
reversibility. This design enables inter-block parallelism, significantly
accelerating training and inference while retaining the memory-saving benefits
of reversibility. Experiments on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, CIFAR10-DVS, and DVS128
Gesture demonstrate that ParaRevSNN matches or exceeds the accuracy of standard
RevSNNs, while reducing training time by up to 35.2\% and inference time to
18.15\%, making it well-suited for deployment in resource-constrained
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于缓存的测试时间适应方法依赖低熵样本构建原型，但在分布偏移下可能不可靠，且无法保证类内紧凑性。研究发现性能与类内紧凑性正相关，因此提出改进方法。

Method: 提出MCP方法，包含三个缓存：熵缓存（低熵样本初始化原型）、对齐缓存（整合视觉和文本信息实现类内紧凑）、负缓存（高熵样本校准预测）。进一步开发MCP++框架，引入跨模态原型对齐和残差学习。

Result: 在15个下游任务上的实验表明，MCP和MCP++实现了最先进的泛化性能。

Conclusion: 多缓存和跨模态对齐能有效提升测试时间适应的性能，尤其在分布偏移下表现优异。

Abstract: In zero-shot setting, test-time adaptation adjusts pre-trained models using
unlabeled data from the test phase to enhance performance on unknown test
distributions. Existing cache-enhanced TTA methods rely on a low-entropy
criterion to select samples for prototype construction, assuming intra-class
compactness. However, low-entropy samples may be unreliable under distribution
shifts, and the resulting prototypes may not ensure compact intra-class
distributions. This study identifies a positive correlation between
cache-enhanced performance and intra-class compactness. Based on this
observation, we propose a Multi-Cache enhanced Prototype-based Test-Time
Adaptation (MCP) featuring three caches: an entropy cache for initializing
prototype representations with low-entropy samples, an align cache for
integrating visual and textual information to achieve compact intra-class
distributions, and a negative cache for prediction calibration using
high-entropy samples. We further developed MCP++, a framework incorporating
cross-modal prototype alignment and residual learning, introducing prototype
residual fine-tuning. Comparative and ablation experiments across 15 downstream
tasks demonstrate that the proposed method and framework achieve
state-of-the-art generalization performance.

Conclusion: 该框架通过模糊校准和去偏方法，有效解决了多视图开放集学习中的挑战。

Abstract: Existing multi-view learning models struggle in open-set scenarios due to
their implicit assumption of class completeness. Moreover, static view-induced
biases, which arise from spurious view-label associations formed during
training, further degrade their ability to recognize unknown categories. In
this paper, we propose a multi-view open-set learning framework via ambiguity
uncertainty calibration and view-wise debiasing. To simulate ambiguous samples,
we design O-Mix, a novel synthesis strategy to generate virtual samples with
calibrated open-set ambiguity uncertainty. These samples are further processed
by an auxiliary ambiguity perception network that captures atypical patterns
for improved open-set adaptation. Furthermore, we incorporate an HSIC-based
contrastive debiasing module that enforces independence between view-specific
ambiguous and view-consistent representations, encouraging the model to learn
generalizable features. Extensive experiments on diverse multi-view benchmarks
demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently enhances unknown-class
recognition while preserving strong closed-set performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）的高计算成本限制了其广泛应用，现有方法在高剪枝率下性能下降严重。

Method: ACCM包含轻量级标题模型和选择器，通过自监督学习生成问题相关描述并选择合适标题。

Result: 在七个基准测试中，ACCM以更低计算成本（如减少6.5% FLOPs）超越现有方法20.6%。

Conclusion: ACCM有效解决了高剪枝率下的视觉信息损失问题，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Despite the great success of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs), their high
computational cost severely limits their broad applications. The computational
cost of LVLMs mainly stems from the visual sequence of the input, which
consists of hundreds or even thousands of tokens. Although existing methods
have made progress by removing redundant tokens, they suffer from severe
performance degradation with high pruning rates due to the loss of visual
information. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Content Compensation Method
(ACCM), which can effectively mitigate the visual information loss via an image
caption. Specifically, ACCM comprises two key components: a lightweight caption
model and a selector. Firstly the caption model generates question-related
descriptions under the guidance of the user instruction. Then the selector
further identifies a contextually appropriate caption from multiple candidates.
Leveraging self-supervised learning, our modules could be learned efficiently
without any human or automated labeling. We conduct extensive experiments
across seven benchmarks and the results show that ACCM significantly
outperforms existing methods with lower FLOPs (e.g., surpassing SOTA by 20.6%
with 6.5% fewer FLOPs).

Result: 实验表明，OCSplats在不同复杂度场景中均实现领先的重建性能和精确的标签噪声分类。

Conclusion: OCSplats为3D高斯重建中的抗噪问题提供了高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become one of the most promising 3D
reconstruction technologies. However, label noise in real-world scenarios-such
as moving objects, non-Lambertian surfaces, and shadows-often leads to
reconstruction errors. Existing 3DGS-Bsed anti-noise reconstruction methods
either fail to separate noise effectively or require scene-specific fine-tuning
of hyperparameters, making them difficult to apply in practice. This paper
re-examines the problem of anti-noise reconstruction from the perspective of
epistemic uncertainty, proposing a novel framework, OCSplats. By combining key
technologies such as hybrid noise assessment and observation-based cognitive
correction, the accuracy of noise classification in areas with cognitive
differences has been significantly improved. Moreover, to address the issue of
varying noise proportions in different scenarios, we have designed a label
noise classification pipeline based on dynamic anchor points. This pipeline
enables OCSplats to be applied simultaneously to scenarios with vastly
different noise proportions without adjusting parameters. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that OCSplats always achieve leading reconstruction performance and
precise label noise classification in scenes of different complexity levels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检测器在未知生成模型下泛化能力不足，尤其是当真实与生成图像的语义内容高度相似时。

Method: 提出NS-Net框架，利用NULL-Space投影解耦CLIP特征中的语义信息，结合对比学习捕获分布差异，并设计Patch Selection策略保留细粒度伪影。

Result: 在包含40种生成模型的开放世界基准测试中，NS-Net检测准确率提升7.4%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: NS-Net在GAN和扩散模型生成的图像检测中表现出强泛化能力，解决了语义信息干扰问题。

Abstract: The rapid progress of generative models, such as GANs and diffusion models,
has facilitated the creation of highly realistic images, raising growing
concerns over their misuse in security-sensitive domains. While existing
detectors perform well under known generative settings, they often fail to
generalize to unknown generative models, especially when semantic content
between real and fake images is closely aligned. In this paper, we revisit the
use of CLIP features for AI-generated image detection and uncover a critical
limitation: the high-level semantic information embedded in CLIP's visual
features hinders effective discrimination. To address this, we propose NS-Net,
a novel detection framework that leverages NULL-Space projection to decouple
semantic information from CLIP's visual features, followed by contrastive
learning to capture intrinsic distributional differences between real and
generated images. Furthermore, we design a Patch Selection strategy to preserve
fine-grained artifacts by mitigating semantic bias caused by global image
structures. Extensive experiments on an open-world benchmark comprising images
generated by 40 diverse generative models show that NS-Net outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 7.4\% improvement in detection accuracy,
thereby demonstrating strong generalization across both GAN- and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少密集像素级标注的高成本，利用弱监督（如图像级标签和自然语言描述）进行面部解析。

Result: 在CelebAMask-HQ、LaPa和Helen数据集上表现优异，显著优于现有弱监督方法。

Conclusion: WSFP任务具有挑战性，DisFaceRep通过解耦表示有效提升了性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Face parsing aims to segment facial images into key components such as eyes,
lips, and eyebrows. While existing methods rely on dense pixel-level
annotations, such annotations are expensive and labor-intensive to obtain. To
reduce annotation cost, we introduce Weakly Supervised Face Parsing (WSFP), a
new task setting that performs dense facial component segmentation using only
weak supervision, such as image-level labels and natural language descriptions.
WSFP introduces unique challenges due to the high co-occurrence and visual
similarity of facial components, which lead to ambiguous activations and
degraded parsing performance. To address this, we propose DisFaceRep, a
representation disentanglement framework designed to separate co-occurring
facial components through both explicit and implicit mechanisms. Specifically,
we introduce a co-occurring component disentanglement strategy to explicitly
reduce dataset-level bias, and a text-guided component disentanglement loss to
guide component separation using language supervision implicitly. Extensive
experiments on CelebAMask-HQ, LaPa, and Helen demonstrate the difficulty of
WSFP and the effectiveness of DisFaceRep, which significantly outperforms
existing weakly supervised semantic segmentation methods. The code will be
released at

Conclusion: ODOV检测是一个重要且有挑战性的任务，提出的方法和数据集为未来研究提供了基础。

Abstract: In this work, we handle a new problem of Open-Domain Open-Vocabulary (ODOV)
object detection, which considers the detection model's adaptability to the
real world including both domain and category shifts. For this problem, we
first construct a new benchmark OD-LVIS, which includes 46,949 images, covers
18 complex real-world domains and 1,203 categories, and provides a
comprehensive dataset for evaluating real-world object detection. Besides, we
develop a novel baseline method for ODOV detection.The proposed method first
leverages large language models to generate the domain-agnostic text prompts
for category embedding. It further learns the domain embedding from the given
image, which, during testing, can be integrated into the category embedding to
form the customized domain-specific category embedding for each test image. We
provide sufficient benchmark evaluations for the proposed ODOV detection task
and report the results, which verify the rationale of ODOV detection, the
usefulness of our benchmark, and the superiority of the proposed method.

*Zihan Li,Wei Sun,Jing Hu,Jianhua Yin,Jianlong Wu,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于跨模态语义一致性的自增强框架，用于高效图像聚类，通过两阶段方法显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常冻结预训练模型的编码器，导致任务无关表示与特定聚类任务需求不匹配，限制了性能。

Method: 第一阶段通过跨模态语义一致性训练轻量级聚类头；第二阶段通过自增强微调联合优化视觉编码器和聚类头。

Result: 在六个主流数据集上表现优异，ViT-B/32模型性能甚至超过基于更大ViT-L/14的现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过跨模态语义一致性和自增强微调，显著提升了图像聚类的性能。

Abstract: While large language-image pre-trained models like CLIP offer powerful
generic features for image clustering, existing methods typically freeze the
encoder. This creates a fundamental mismatch between the model's task-agnostic
representations and the demands of a specific clustering task, imposing a
ceiling on performance. To break this ceiling, we propose a self-enhanced
framework based on cross-modal semantic consistency for efficient image
clustering. Our framework first builds a strong foundation via Cross-Modal
Semantic Consistency and then specializes the encoder through Self-Enhancement.
In the first stage, we focus on Cross-Modal Semantic Consistency. By mining
consistency between generated image-text pairs at the instance, cluster
assignment, and cluster center levels, we train lightweight clustering heads to
align with the rich semantics of the pre-trained model. This alignment process
is bolstered by a novel method for generating higher-quality cluster centers
and a dynamic balancing regularizer to ensure well-distributed assignments. In
the second stage, we introduce a Self-Enhanced fine-tuning strategy. The
well-aligned model from the first stage acts as a reliable pseudo-label
generator. These self-generated supervisory signals are then used to feed back
the efficient, joint optimization of the vision encoder and clustering heads,
unlocking their full potential. Extensive experiments on six mainstream
datasets show that our method outperforms existing deep clustering methods by
significant margins. Notably, our ViT-B/32 model already matches or even
surpasses the accuracy of state-of-the-art methods built upon the far larger
ViT-L/14.

*Zhengxue Wang,Yuan Wu,Xiang Li,Zhiqiang Yan,Jian Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为STDNet的新方法，通过空间和时间差异分支解决视频深度超分辨率中的长尾分布问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频深度超分辨率在空间非平滑区域和时间变化区域存在长尾分布问题，影响重建质量。

Method: STDNet包含空间差异分支和时间差异分支，分别通过动态对齐RGB特征和优先传播时间变化信息来解决长尾问题。

Result: 实验表明STDNet在多个数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: STDNet有效解决了视频深度超分辨率中的长尾分布问题，提升了重建质量。

Abstract: Depth super-resolution has achieved impressive performance, and the
incorporation of multi-frame information further enhances reconstruction
quality. Nevertheless, statistical analyses reveal that video depth
super-resolution remains affected by pronounced long-tailed distributions, with
the long-tailed effects primarily manifesting in spatial non-smooth regions and
temporal variation zones. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
SpatioTemporal Difference Network (STDNet) comprising two core branches: a
spatial difference branch and a temporal difference branch. In the spatial
difference branch, we introduce a spatial difference mechanism to mitigate the
long-tailed issues in spatial non-smooth regions. This mechanism dynamically
aligns RGB features with learned spatial difference representations, enabling
intra-frame RGB-D aggregation for depth calibration. In the temporal difference
branch, we further design a temporal difference strategy that preferentially
propagates temporal variation information from adjacent RGB and depth frames to
the current depth frame, leveraging temporal difference representations to
achieve precise motion compensation in temporal long-tailed areas. Extensive
experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
our STDNet, outperforming existing approaches.

Motivation: 解决扩散模型生成图像多样性不足导致的信息冗余问题。

Method: ACS将蒸馏数据集分为多个课程，通过对抗性损失引导扩散采样，逐步生成从简单到复杂的图像。

Result: 在Imagewoof和ImageNet-1k上分别提升4.1%和2.1%。

Conclusion: ACS有效提升数据集蒸馏的多样性和性能。

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to encapsulate the rich information contained in
dataset into a compact distilled dataset but it faces performance degradation
as the image-per-class (IPC) setting or image resolution grows larger. Recent
advancements demonstrate that integrating diffusion generative models can
effectively facilitate the compression of large-scale datasets while
maintaining efficiency due to their superiority in matching data distribution
and summarizing representative patterns. However, images sampled from diffusion
models are always blamed for lack of diversity which may lead to information
redundancy when multiple independent sampled images are aggregated as a
distilled dataset. To address this issue, we propose Adversary-guided
Curriculum Sampling (ACS), which partitions the distilled dataset into multiple
curricula. For generating each curriculum, ACS guides diffusion sampling
process by an adversarial loss to challenge a discriminator trained on sampled
images, thus mitigating information overlap between curricula and fostering a
more diverse distilled dataset. Additionally, as the discriminator evolves with
the progression of curricula, ACS generates images from simpler to more
complex, ensuring efficient and systematic coverage of target data
informational spectrum. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
ACS, which achieves substantial improvements of 4.1\% on Imagewoof and 2.1\% on
ImageNet-1k over the state-of-the-art.

Method: 通过添加高斯噪声参数（σ, μ）生成噪声点云，并评估PointNet、DGCNN和Point Transformer v3的分类准确性、校准指标和不确定性感知能力。

Result: 所有模型在噪声增加时性能下降，但Point Transformer v3表现出更好的校准性，其预测的不确定性与实际测量不确定性更接近。

Conclusion: ModelNet40-E为点云分类模型的鲁棒性和不确定性建模提供了有效的评估工具，Point Transformer v3在噪声环境下表现最佳。

Abstract: We introduce ModelNet40-E, a new benchmark designed to assess the robustness

Motivation: 现有零样本视频描述方法因忽略时间动态性而表现不佳，需改进。

Method: 采用语义组解码（SGD）策略和多帧信息建模，结合关键句子选择（KSS）和概率采样监督（PSS）模块。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著优于现有零样本方法，甚至接近全监督方法。

Conclusion: SGCap通过建模时间动态性和语义多样性，提升了零样本视频描述的性能。

Abstract: Zero-shot video captioning aims to generate sentences for describing videos
without training the model on video-text pairs, which remains underexplored.
Existing zero-shot image captioning methods typically adopt a text-only
training paradigm, where a language decoder reconstructs single-sentence
embeddings obtained from CLIP. However, directly extending them to the video
domain is suboptimal, as applying average pooling over all frames neglects
temporal dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose a Semantic Group
Captioning (SGCap) method for zero-shot video captioning. In particular, it
develops the Semantic Group Decoding (SGD) strategy to employ multi-frame
information while explicitly modeling inter-frame temporal relationships.
Furthermore, existing zero-shot captioning methods that rely on cosine
similarity for sentence retrieval and reconstruct the description supervised by
a single frame-level caption, fail to provide sufficient video-level
supervision. To alleviate this, we introduce two key components, including the
Key Sentences Selection (KSS) module and the Probability Sampling Supervision
(PSS) module. The two modules construct semantically-diverse sentence groups
that models temporal dynamics and guide the model to capture inter-sentence
causal relationships, thereby enhancing its generalization ability to video
captioning. Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that SGCap
significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art zero-shot alternatives and
even achieves performance competitive with fully supervised ones. Code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: T2I模型容易生成不安全内容（如暴力或色情图像），现有防御方法依赖大规模数据集且静态防御，导致计算成本高、适应性差。PromptSafe旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 使用LLM重写不安全提示为安全替代，构建文本训练语料；优化通用软提示以在扩散去噪过程中排斥不安全内容；引入门控机制动态调整防御强度。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，PromptSafe将不安全生成率降至2.36%，同时保持高良性生成质量，并展现出对未知有害类别的强泛化能力。

Conclusion: PromptSafe通过轻量级文本训练和动态门控机制，实现了高效、可扩展的安全防护，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have demonstrated remarkable generative
capabilities but remain vulnerable to producing not-safe-for-work (NSFW)
content, such as violent or explicit imagery. While recent moderation efforts
have introduced soft prompt-guided tuning by appending defensive tokens to the
input, these approaches often rely on large-scale curated image-text datasets
and apply static, one-size-fits-all defenses at inference time. However, this
results not only in high computational cost and degraded benign image quality,
but also in limited adaptability to the diverse and nuanced safety requirements
of real-world prompts. To address these challenges, we propose PromptSafe, a
gated prompt tuning framework that combines a lightweight, text-only supervised
soft embedding with an inference-time gated control network. Instead of
training on expensive image-text datasets, we first rewrite unsafe prompts into
semantically aligned but safe alternatives using an LLM, constructing an
efficient text-only training corpus. Based on this, we optimize a universal
soft prompt that repels unsafe and attracts safe embeddings during the
diffusion denoising process. To avoid over-suppressing benign prompts, we
introduce a gated mechanism that adaptively adjusts the defensive strength
based on estimated prompt toxicity, thereby aligning defense intensity with
prompt risk and ensuring strong protection for harmful inputs while preserving
benign generation quality. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and
T2I models show that PromptSafe achieves a SOTA unsafe generation rate (2.36%),
while preserving high benign fidelity. Furthermore, PromptSafe demonstrates
strong generalization to unseen harmful categories, robust transferability
across diffusion model architectures, and resilience under adaptive adversarial
attacks, highlighting its practical value for safe and scalable deployment.

Method: 提出了一种插拔式视差置信度估计算法和两种深度先验引导的损失函数，通过局部一致性检查和准密集对应关系学习深度排名。

Result: 在KITTI Stereo基准测试中，达到了无监督立体匹配方法中的最先进精度。

Conclusion: 该方法通过高效利用3D几何知识，显著提升了无监督立体匹配的性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised stereo matching has garnered significant attention for its
independence from costly disparity annotations. Typical unsupervised methods
rely on the multi-view consistency assumption for training networks, which
suffer considerably from stereo matching ambiguities, such as repetitive
patterns and texture-less regions. A feasible solution lies in transferring 3D
geometric knowledge from a relative depth map to the stereo matching networks.
However, existing knowledge transfer methods learn depth ranking information
from randomly built sparse correspondences, which makes inefficient utilization
of 3D geometric knowledge and introduces noise from mistaken disparity
estimates. This work proposes a novel unsupervised learning framework to
address these challenges, which comprises a plug-and-play disparity confidence
estimation algorithm and two depth prior-guided loss functions. Specifically,
the local coherence consistency between neighboring disparities and their
corresponding relative depths is first checked to obtain disparity confidence.
Afterwards, quasi-dense correspondences are built using only confident
disparity estimates to facilitate efficient depth ranking learning. Finally, a
dual disparity smoothness loss is proposed to boost stereo matching performance
at disparity discontinuities. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art stereo matching accuracy on the KITTI Stereo
benchmarks among all unsupervised stereo matching methods.

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is the leading approach for whole slide
image (WSI) classification, enabling efficient analysis of gigapixel pathology
slides. Recent work has introduced vision-language models (VLMs) into MIL
pipelines to incorporate medical knowledge through text-based class
descriptions rather than simple class names. However, when these methods rely
on large language models (LLMs) to generate clinical descriptions or use
fixed-length prompts to represent complex pathology concepts, the limited token
capacity of VLMs often constrains the expressiveness and richness of the
encoded class information. Additionally, descriptions generated solely by LLMs
may lack domain grounding and fine-grained medical specificity, leading to
suboptimal alignment with visual features. To address these challenges, we
propose a vision-language MIL framework with two key contributions: (1) A
grounded multi-agent description generation system that leverages curated
pathology textbooks and agent specialization (e.g., morphology, spatial
context) to produce accurate and diverse clinical descriptions; (2) A text
encoding strategy using a list of descriptions rather than a single prompt,
capturing fine-grained and complementary clinical signals for better alignment
with visual features. Integrated into a VLM-MIL pipeline, our approach shows
improved performance over single-prompt class baselines and achieves results
comparable to state-of-the-art models, as demonstrated on renal and lung cancer
datasets.

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著提升了现有立体匹配网络的泛化性能。

Conclusion: UgDA方法简单、架构无关，能有效提升模型对跨域数据的适应能力。

Abstract: State-of-the-art stereo matching (SM) models trained on synthetic data often
fail to generalize to real data domains due to domain differences, such as
color, illumination, contrast, and texture. To address this challenge, we
leverage data augmentation to expand the training domain, encouraging the model
to acquire robust cross-domain feature representations instead of
domain-dependent shortcuts. This paper proposes an uncertainty-guided data
augmentation (UgDA) method, which argues that the image statistics in RGB space
(mean and standard deviation) carry the domain characteristics. Thus, samples
in unseen domains can be generated by properly perturbing these statistics.
Furthermore, to simulate more potential domains, Gaussian distributions founded
on batch-level statistics are poposed to model the unceratinty of perturbation
direction and intensity. Additionally, we further enforce feature consistency
between original and augmented data for the same scene, encouraging the model
to learn structure aware, shortcuts-invariant feature representations. Our
approach is simple, architecture-agnostic, and can be integrated into any SM
networks. Extensive experiments on several challenging benchmarks have
demonstrated that our method can significantly improve the generalization
performance of existing SM networks.

Result: 在三个公共数据集上平均AUROC分别为66.4%、83.1%和63.4%。

Conclusion: C3D-AD框架在3D异常检测中表现出色，能够持续学习并适应新类别。

Abstract: 3D Anomaly Detection (AD) has shown great potential in detecting anomalies or
defects of high-precision industrial products. However, existing methods are
typically trained in a class-specific manner and also lack the capability of
learning from emerging classes. In this study, we proposed a continual learning
framework named Continual 3D Anomaly Detection (C3D-AD), which can not only
learn generalized representations for multi-class point clouds but also handle
new classes emerging over time.Specifically, in the feature extraction module,
to extract generalized local features from diverse product types of different
tasks efficiently, Kernel Attention with random feature Layer (KAL) is
introduced, which normalizes the feature space. Then, to reconstruct data
correctly and continually, an efficient Kernel Attention with learnable Advisor
(KAA) mechanism is proposed, which learns the information from new categories
while discarding redundant old information within both the encoder and decoder.
Finally, to keep the representation consistency over tasks, a Reconstruction
with Parameter Perturbation (RPP) module is proposed by designing a
representation rehearsal loss function, which ensures that the model remembers
previous category information and returns category-adaptive
representation.Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an average performance of
66.4%, 83.1%, and 63.4% AUROC on Real3D-AD, Anomaly-ShapeNet, and MulSen-AD,
respectively.

Abstract: Distal myopathy represents a genetically heterogeneous group of skeletal
muscle disorders with broad clinical manifestations, posing diagnostic
challenges in radiology. To address this, we propose a novel multimodal
attention-aware fusion architecture that combines features extracted from two
distinct deep learning models, one capturing global contextual information and
the other focusing on local details, representing complementary aspects of the
input data. Uniquely, our approach integrates these features through an
attention gate mechanism, enhancing both predictive performance and
interpretability. Our method achieves a high classification accuracy on the
BUSI benchmark and a proprietary distal myopathy dataset, while also generating
clinically relevant saliency maps that support transparent decision-making in
medical diagnosis. We rigorously evaluated interpretability through (1)
functionally grounded metrics, coherence scoring against reference masks and
incremental deletion analysis, and (2) application-grounded validation with
seven expert radiologists. While our fusion strategy boosts predictive
performance relative to single-stream and alternative fusion strategies, both
quantitative and qualitative evaluations reveal persistent gaps in anatomical
specificity and clinical usefulness of the interpretability. These findings
highlight the need for richer, context-aware interpretability methods and
human-in-the-loop feedback to meet clinicians' expectations in real-world
diagnostic settings.

Conclusion: CSINet通过增强全局和局部语义的利用，有效解决了遥感图像分割中的挑战。

Abstract: Recently, Referring Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (RRSIS) has aroused
wide attention. To handle drastic scale variation of remote targets, existing
methods only use the full image as input and nest the saliency-preferring
techniques of cross-scale information interaction into traditional single-view
structure. Although effective for visually salient targets, they still struggle
in handling tiny, ambiguous ones in lots of real scenarios. In this work, we
instead propose a paralleled yet unified segmentation framework Cross-view
Semantics Interaction Network (CSINet) to solve the limitations. Motivated by
human behavior in observing targets of interest, the network orchestrates
visual cues from remote and close distances to conduct synergistic prediction.
In its every encoding stage, a Cross-View Window-attention module (CVWin) is
utilized to supplement global and local semantics into close-view and
remote-view branch features, finally promoting the unified representation of
feature in every encoding stage. In addition, we develop a Collaboratively
Dilated Attention enhanced Decoder (CDAD) to mine the orientation property of
target and meanwhile integrate cross-view multiscale features. The proposed
network seamlessly enhances the exploitation of global and local semantics,
achieving significant improvements over others while maintaining satisfactory

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决皮肤红斑检测中对大量标注数据的依赖问题，提供一种无需训练掩模的灵活诊断工具。

Method: 利用扩散模型生成无红斑的参考图像，并通过颜色空间分析与原图对齐，识别红斑区域。

Result: 在初步实验中成功分离面部红斑，性能优于基线阈值方法。

Conclusion: 结合生成扩散模型与统计颜色分割，为计算机辅助皮肤病学提供高效红斑检测方案。

Abstract: This study proposes a zero-shot image segmentation framework for detecting
erythema (redness of the skin) using edit-friendly inversion in diffusion
models. The method synthesizes reference images of the same patient that are
free from erythema via generative editing and then accurately aligns these
references with the original images. Color-space analysis is performed with
minimal user intervention to identify erythematous regions. This approach
significantly reduces the reliance on labeled dermatological datasets while
providing a scalable and flexible diagnostic support tool by avoiding the need
for any annotated training masks. In our initial qualitative experiments, the
pipeline successfully isolated facial erythema in diverse cases, demonstrating
performance improvements over baseline threshold-based techniques. These
results highlight the potential of combining generative diffusion models and
statistical color segmentation for computer-aided dermatology, enabling
efficient erythema detection without prior training data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型的广泛应用导致个人艺术作品被未经授权使用，现有保护方法（如扰动、水印）防御能力有限，无法有效保护在线发布的艺术品。

Method: 1. 语义自重建增强风格表达；2. 多层图像特征自适应融合生成风格指纹；3. 将艺术家风格建模为特征空间中的最小包围超球边界。

Result: 实验表明，StyleSentinel在单样本验证任务上表现优于现有方法，并在在线平台上验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: StyleSentinel通过风格指纹和一类学习任务，为艺术品版权保护提供了一种高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: The versatility of diffusion models in generating customized images has led
to unauthorized usage of personal artwork, which poses a significant threat to
the intellectual property of artists. Existing approaches relying on embedding
additional information, such as perturbations, watermarks, and backdoors,
suffer from limited defensive capabilities and fail to protect artwork
published online. In this paper, we propose StyleSentinel, an approach for
copyright protection of artwork by verifying an inherent stylistic fingerprint
in the artist's artwork. Specifically, we employ a semantic self-reconstruction
process to enhance stylistic expressiveness within the artwork, which
establishes a dense and style-consistent manifold foundation for feature
learning. Subsequently, we adaptively fuse multi-layer image features to encode
abstract artistic style into a compact stylistic fingerprint. Finally, we model
the target artist's style as a minimal enclosing hypersphere boundary in the
feature space, transforming complex copyright verification into a robust
one-class learning task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared with
the state-of-the-art, StyleSentinel achieves superior performance on the
one-sample verification task. We also demonstrate the effectiveness through
online platforms.

Motivation: 减轻像素级标注的负担，并提升弱监督图像伪造定位的性能。

Method: 结合视觉-语言特征建模网络和自适应推理网络，通过双预测头实现图像级分类和像素级定位。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上显著优于现有方法，达到最先进的检测和定位性能。

Conclusion: ViLaCo通过引入语义监督和对比一致性模块，有效弥补了弱监督的不足，实现了高精度的伪造定位。

Abstract: Image forgery localization aims to precisely identify tampered regions within
images, but it commonly depends on costly pixel-level annotations. To alleviate
this annotation burden, weakly supervised image forgery localization (WSIFL)
has emerged, yet existing methods still achieve limited localization
performance as they mainly exploit intra-image consistency clues and lack
external semantic guidance to compensate for weak supervision. In this paper,
we propose ViLaCo, a vision-language collaborative reasoning framework that
introduces auxiliary semantic supervision distilled from pre-trained
vision-language models (VLMs), enabling accurate pixel-level localization using
only image-level labels. Specifically, ViLaCo first incorporates semantic
knowledge through a vision-language feature modeling network, which jointly
extracts textual and visual priors using pre-trained VLMs. Next, an adaptive
vision-language reasoning network aligns textual semantics and visual features
through mutual interactions, producing semantically aligned representations.
Subsequently, these representations are passed into dual prediction heads,
where the coarse head performs image-level classification and the fine head
generates pixel-level localization masks, thereby bridging the gap between weak
supervision and fine-grained localization. Moreover, a contrastive patch
consistency module is introduced to cluster tampered features while separating
authentic ones, facilitating more reliable forgery discrimination. Extensive
experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that ViLaCo substantially
outperforms existing WSIFL methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in
both detection and localization accuracy.

Result: 在对象发现任务上性能提升高达10分，达到新SOTA，并提升了下游任务如动态建模的表现。

Conclusion: RandSF.Q通过改进查询预测机制，显著提升了无监督视频对象中心学习的性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised video Object-Centric Learning (OCL) is promising as it enables
object-level scene representation and dynamics modeling as we humans do.
Mainstream video OCL methods adopt a recurrent architecture: An aggregator
aggregates current video frame into object features, termed slots, under some
queries; A transitioner transits current slots to queries for the next frame.
This is an effective architecture but all existing implementations both
(\textit{i1}) neglect to incorporate next frame features, the most informative
source for query prediction, and (\textit{i2}) fail to learn transition
dynamics, the knowledge essential for query prediction. To address these
issues, we propose Random Slot-Feature pair for learning Query prediction
(RandSF.Q): (\textit{t1}) We design a new transitioner to incorporate both
slots and features, which provides more information for query prediction;
(\textit{t2}) We train the transitioner to predict queries from slot-feature
pairs randomly sampled from available recurrences, which drives it to learn
transition dynamics. Experiments on scene representation demonstrate that our
method surpass existing video OCL methods significantly, e.g., up to 10 points
on object discovery, setting new state-of-the-art. Such superiority also
benefits downstream tasks like dynamics modeling. Our core source code and
training logs are available as the supplement.

Abstract: It is of crucial importance to assess damages promptly and accurately in

approaches struggle to generalize effectively due to the imbalance of data
classes, scarcity of moderate damage examples, and human inaccuracy in pixel
labeling during HADR situations. To accommodate for these limitations and
exploit state-of-the-art techniques in vision-language models (VLMs) to fuse
imagery with human knowledge understanding, there is an opportunity to generate
a diversified set of image-based damage data effectively. Our initial
experimental results suggest encouraging data generation quality, which
demonstrates an improvement in classifying scenes with different levels of
structural damage to buildings, roads, and infrastructures.

Abstract: False positives in pedestrian detection remain a challenge that has yet to be
effectively resolved. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Full-stage
Refined Proposal (FRP) algorithm aimed at eliminating these false positives
within a two-stage CNN-based pedestrian detection framework. The main
innovation of this work lies in employing various pedestrian feature
re-evaluation strategies to filter out low-quality pedestrian proposals during
both the training and testing stages. Specifically, in the training phase, the
Training mode FRP algorithm (TFRP) introduces a novel approach for validating
pedestrian proposals to effectively guide the model training process, thereby
constructing a model with strong capabilities for false positive suppression.
During the inference phase, two innovative strategies are implemented: the
Classifier-guided FRP (CFRP) algorithm integrates a pedestrian classifier into
the proposal generation pipeline to yield high-quality proposals through
pedestrian feature evaluation, and the Split-proposal FRP (SFRP) algorithm
vertically divides all proposals, sending both the original and the sub-region
proposals to the subsequent subnetwork to evaluate their confidence scores,
filtering out those with lower sub-region pedestrian confidence scores. As a
result, the proposed algorithm enhances the model's ability to suppress
pedestrian false positives across all stages. Various experiments conducted on
multiple benchmarks and the SY-Metro datasets demonstrate that the model,
supported by different combinations of the FRP algorithm, can effectively
eliminate false positives to varying extents. Furthermore, experiments
conducted on embedded platforms underscore the algorithm's effectiveness in
enhancing the comprehensive pedestrian detection capabilities of the small
pedestrian detector in resource-constrained edge devices.

Conclusion: LOLViT通过自适应特征图大小和全局-局部融合机制，有效解决了计算效率不平衡问题，显著提升了轻量级混合模型的性能。

Abstract: Currently, lightweight hybrid backbone networks have partially alleviated the
issue of computational saturation, but the imbalance in computational
efficiencys between convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and attention
mechanisms is becoming increasingly apparent. Specifically, although linear
attention mechanisms and their variants have made progress in lightweight
design, they still fail to meet the demands of hybrid models for long-sequence
modeling. On the other hand, existing lightweight SoftMax attention
computations typically reduce the feature map to a fixed size to decrease the
number of sequences, thereby compressing the computational scale. However, the
process of determining the feature map reduction ratio is cumbersome, and
computational saturation issues still persist. To address this issue, this
paper proposes a lightweight SoftMax attention mechanism with adaptive feature
map sizes, named Fast Window Attention (FWA), which generates a small number of
key sequences (Key and Value) through window aggregation for attention
computation. Additionally, it explains the rationality of using ReLU to
simulate SoftMax operations in lightweight global attention mechanisms.
Finally, the paper designs a global-local feature fusion mechanism and combines
it with GhostNet to propose a lightweight hybrid backbone network, LOLViT.
Through visual tasks such as classification (ImageNet 1K), detection (COCO
2017), and segmentation (BDD100K), along with extensive ablation studies, it is
demonstrated that LOLViT outperforms CNN models of the same level in both
inference speed and model accuracy. Notably, the inference speed of LOLViT-X is
5x that of MobileViT-X.

Motivation: 随着机器人探索任务的复杂性增加，高质量数字地形图（DTM）的需求日益增长，但传统方法依赖繁琐的手动预处理，限制了效率。

Method: 采用神经体积渲染技术，仅需每个图像像素的轨迹，无需深度或其他结构先验，直接从卫星图像中学习地形图。

Result: 在合成和真实卫星数据（地球和火星）上验证，结果显示地形预测精度接近卫星图像分辨率，即使相机参数不完美。

Conclusion: NTM方法展示了高效且高精度的地形图生成潜力，为未来行星探索提供了新工具。

Abstract: Digital terrain maps (DTMs) are an important part of planetary exploration,
enabling operations such as terrain relative navigation during entry, descent,
and landing for spacecraft and aiding in navigation on the ground. As robotic
exploration missions become more ambitious, the need for high quality DTMs will
only increase. However, producing DTMs via multi-view stereo pipelines for
satellite imagery, the current state-of-the-art, can be cumbersome and require
significant manual image preprocessing to produce satisfactory results. In this
work, we seek to address these shortcomings by adapting neural volume rendering
techniques to learn textured digital terrain maps directly from satellite
imagery. Our method, neural terrain maps (NTM), only requires the locus for
each image pixel and does not rely on depth or any other structural priors. We
demonstrate our method on both synthetic and real satellite data from Earth and
Mars encompassing scenes on the order of $100 \textrm{km}^2$. We evaluate the
accuracy of our output terrain maps by comparing with existing high-quality
DTMs produced using traditional multi-view stereo pipelines. Our method shows
promising results, with the precision of terrain prediction almost equal to the
resolution of the satellite images even in the presence of imperfect camera
intrinsics and extrinsics.

Abstract: Automatic license plate recognition (ALPR) and vehicle make and model
recognition underpin intelligent transportation systems, supporting law
enforcement, toll collection, and post-incident investigation. Applying these
methods to videos captured by handheld smartphones or non-static
vehicle-mounted cameras presents unique challenges compared to fixed
installations, including frequent camera motion, varying viewpoints,
occlusions, and unknown road geometry. Traditional ALPR solutions, dependent on
specialized hardware and handcrafted OCR pipelines, often degrade under these
conditions. Recent advances in large vision-language models (VLMs) enable
direct recognition of textual and semantic attributes from arbitrary imagery.
This study evaluates the potential of VLMs for ALPR and makes and models
recognition using monocular videos captured with handheld smartphones and
non-static mounted cameras. The proposed license plate recognition pipeline
filters to sharp frames, then sends a multimodal prompt to a VLM using several
prompt strategies. Make and model recognition pipeline runs the same VLM with a
revised prompt and an optional self-reflection module. In the self-reflection
module, the model contrasts the query image with a reference from a 134-class
dataset, correcting mismatches. Experiments on a smartphone dataset collected
on the campus of the University of Texas at Austin, achieve top-1 accuracies of
91.67% for ALPR and 66.67% for make and model recognition. On the public
UFPR-ALPR dataset, the approach attains 83.05% and 61.07%, respectively. The
self-reflection module further improves results by 5.72% on average for make
and model recognition. These findings demonstrate that VLMs provide a
cost-effective solution for scalable, in-motion traffic video analysis.

Result: 实验验证了OAPR任务的必要性和所提框架的有效性。

Conclusion: OAPR任务和提出的框架为开放场景下的行人检索提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) plays a crucial role in various vision
tasks such as person retrieval and identification. Most existing
attribute-based retrieval methods operate under the closed-set assumption that
all attribute classes are consistently available during both training and
inference. However, this assumption limits their applicability in real-world
scenarios where novel attributes may emerge. Moreover, predefined attributes in
benchmark datasets are often generic and shared across individuals, making them
less discriminative for retrieving the target person. To address these
challenges, we propose the Open-Attribute Recognition for Person Retrieval
(OAPR) task, which aims to retrieve individuals based on attribute cues,
regardless of whether those attributes were seen during training. To support
this task, we introduce a novel framework designed to learn generalizable body
part representations that cover a broad range of attribute categories.
Furthermore, we reconstruct four widely used datasets for open-attribute
recognition. Comprehensive experiments on these datasets demonstrate the
necessity of the OAPR task and the effectiveness of our framework. The source
code and pre-trained models will be publicly available upon publication.

Motivation: 现有方法主要在空间域处理RAW图像，难以恢复被抑制的细节，而频率域能自然分离特征。

Result: SFAE框架有效提升了RAW图像中物体细节的恢复和检测性能。

Conclusion: 结合空间和频率域的方法为RAW图像物体检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Direct RAW-based object detection offers great promise by utilizing RAW data
(unprocessed sensor data), but faces inherent challenges due to its wide
dynamic range and linear response, which tends to suppress crucial object
details. In particular, existing enhancement methods are almost all performed
in the spatial domain, making it difficult to effectively recover these
suppressed details from the skewed pixel distribution of RAW images. To address
this limitation, we turn to the frequency domain, where features, such as
object contours and textures, can be naturally separated based on frequency. In
this paper, we propose Space-Frequency Aware RAW Image Object Detection
Enhancer (SFAE), a novel framework that synergizes spatial and frequency
representations. Our contribution is threefold. The first lies in the
``spatialization" of frequency bands. Different from the traditional paradigm
of directly manipulating abstract spectra in deep networks, our method
inversely transforms individual frequency bands back into tangible spatial
maps, thus preserving direct physical intuition. Then the cross-domain fusion
attention module is developed to enable deep multimodal interactions between
these maps and the original spatial features. Finally, the framework performs
adaptive nonlinear adjustments by predicting and applying different gamma
parameters for the two domains.

Abstract: Advances in generative models have led to AI-generated images visually
indistinguishable from authentic ones. Despite numerous studies on detecting
AI-generated images with classifiers, a gap persists between such methods and
human cognitive forensic analysis. We present ForenX, a novel method that not
only identifies the authenticity of images but also provides explanations that
resonate with human thoughts. ForenX employs the powerful multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) to analyze and interpret forensic cues. Furthermore, we
overcome the limitations of standard MLLMs in detecting forgeries by
incorporating a specialized forensic prompt that directs the MLLMs attention to
forgery-indicative attributes. This approach not only enhance the
generalization of forgery detection but also empowers the MLLMs to provide
explanations that are accurate, relevant, and comprehensive. Additionally, we
introduce ForgReason, a dataset dedicated to descriptions of forgery evidences
in AI-generated images. Curated through collaboration between an LLM-based
agent and a team of human annotators, this process provides refined data that
further enhances our model's performance. We demonstrate that even limited
manual annotations significantly improve explanation quality. We evaluate the
effectiveness of ForenX on two major benchmarks. The model's explainability is
verified by comprehensive subjective evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RGB-based 3D任务中标注稀缺、昂贵以及传统图像变换破坏几何一致性的问题。

Method: 提出3DRot，一种基于相机光学中心的旋转和镜像增强方法，同步更新RGB图像、相机内参、物体位姿和3D标注。

Result: 在SUN RGB-D数据集上，3DRot显著提升了3D检测的IoU、旋转误差和mAP。

Conclusion: 3DRot是一种高效且可扩展的数据增强方法，适用于多种3D任务。

Abstract: RGB-based 3D tasks, e.g., 3D detection, depth estimation, 3D keypoint
estimation, still suffer from scarce, expensive annotations and a thin
augmentation toolbox, since most image transforms, including resize and
rotation, disrupt geometric consistency. In this paper, we introduce 3DRot, a
plug-and-play augmentation that rotates and mirrors images about the camera's
optical center while synchronously updating RGB images, camera intrinsics,
object poses, and 3D annotations to preserve projective geometry-achieving
geometry-consistent rotations and reflections without relying on any scene
depth. We validate 3DRot with a classical 3D task, monocular 3D detection. On
SUN RGB-D dataset, 3DRot raises $IoU_{3D}$ from 43.21 to 44.51, cuts rotation
error (ROT) from 22.91$^\circ$ to 20.93$^\circ$, and boosts $mAP_{0.5}$ from
35.70 to 38.11. As a comparison, Cube R-CNN adds 3 other datasets together with
SUN RGB-D for monocular 3D estimation, with a similar mechanism and test
dataset, increases $IoU_{3D}$ from 36.2 to 37.8, boosts $mAP_{0.5}$ from 34.7
to 35.4. Because it operates purely through camera-space transforms, 3DRot is
readily transferable to other 3D tasks.

that unlocks the untapped potential of multi-domain representation learning for
online handwriting verification (OHV). SPECTRUM comprises three core
components: (1) a multi-scale interactor that finely combines temporal and
frequency features through dual-modal sequence interaction and multi-scale
aggregation, (2) a self-gated fusion module that dynamically integrates global
temporal and frequency features via self-driven balancing. These two components
work synergistically to achieve micro-to-macro spectral-temporal integration.
(3) A multi-domain distance-based verifier then utilizes both temporal and
frequency representations to improve discrimination between genuine and forged
handwriting, surpassing conventional temporal-only approaches. Extensive
experiments demonstrate SPECTRUM's superior performance over existing OHV
methods, underscoring the effectiveness of temporal-frequency multi-domain
learning. Furthermore, we reveal that incorporating multiple handwritten
biometrics fundamentally enhances the discriminative power of handwriting
representations and facilitates verification. These findings not only validate
the efficacy of multi-domain learning in OHV but also pave the way for future
research in multi-domain approaches across both feature and biometric domains.

*Zhuoran Peng,Yiqing Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多粒度非局部自相似性先验的高光谱图像恢复模型，通过交替进行粗粒度和细粒度分解，统一表示全局、局部和非局部先验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 交替使用Tucker分解（粗粒度）和FCTN分解（细粒度）处理非局部自相似性张量组。

Result: 模型在像素和条纹等多种缺失场景中表现出色。

Conclusion: 多粒度分解方法有效提升了高光谱图像恢复的适应性和效果。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) recovery, as an upstream image processing task,
  holds significant importance for downstream tasks such as classification,
  segmentation, and detection. In recent years, HSI recovery methods based on
  non-local prior representations have demonstrated outstanding performance.
However,
  these methods employ a fixed-format factor to represent the non-local
self-similarity
  tensor groups, making them unable to adapt to diverse missing scenarios. To
address
  this issue, we introduce the concept of granularity in tensor decomposition
for the first
  time and propose an HSI recovery model constrained by multi-granularity
non-local
  self-similarity priors. Specifically, the proposed model alternately performs
  coarse-grained decomposition and fine-grained decomposition on the non-local
  self-similarity tensor groups. Among them, the coarse-grained decomposition
builds
  upon Tucker tensor decomposition, which extracts global structural
information of the
  image by performing singular value shrinkage on the mode-unfolded matrices.
The
  fine-grained decomposition employs the FCTN decomposition, capturing local
detail
  information through modeling pairwise correlations among factor tensors. This
  architectural approach achieves a unified representation of global, local,
and non-local
  priors for HSIs. Experimental results demonstrate that the model has strong
  applicability and exhibits outstanding recovery effects in various types of
missing
  scenes such as pixels and stripes.

Motivation: 临床环境中缺乏手动标注时，分割模型的可靠性评估成为难题，阻碍其应用。

Method: 引入两种互补框架：一种基于预测分割和不确定性图，另一种整合原始图像、不确定性图和预测分割图；采用贝叶斯方法量化不确定性。

Conclusion: 框架通过不确定性整合和多指标聚合，提供了更鲁棒的分割质量评估方法，并展示了跨模态的适用性。

Abstract: Image segmentation is a critical step in computational biomedical image
analysis, typically evaluated using metrics like the Dice coefficient during
training and validation. However, in clinical settings without manual
annotations, assessing segmentation quality becomes challenging, and models
lacking reliability indicators face adoption barriers. To address this gap, we
propose a novel framework for predicting segmentation quality without requiring
ground truth annotations during test time. Our approach introduces two
complementary frameworks: one leveraging predicted segmentation and uncertainty
maps, and another integrating the original input image, uncertainty maps, and
predicted segmentation maps. We present Bayesian adaptations of two benchmark
segmentation models-SwinUNet and Feature Pyramid Network with ResNet50-using
Monte Carlo Dropout, Ensemble, and Test Time Augmentation to quantify
uncertainty. We evaluate four uncertainty estimates: confidence map, entropy,
mutual information, and expected pairwise Kullback-Leibler divergence on 2D
skin lesion and 3D liver segmentation datasets, analyzing their correlation
with segmentation quality metrics. Our framework achieves an R2 score of 93.25
and Pearson correlation of 96.58 on the HAM10000 dataset, outperforming
previous segmentation quality assessment methods. For 3D liver segmentation,
Test Time Augmentation with entropy achieves an R2 score of 85.03 and a Pearson
correlation of 65.02, demonstrating cross-modality robustness. Additionally, we
propose an aggregation strategy that combines multiple uncertainty estimates
into a single score per image, offering a more robust and comprehensive
assessment of segmentation quality. Finally, we use Grad-CAM and UMAP-based
embedding analysis to interpret the model's behavior and reliability,
highlighting the impact of uncertainty integration.

TL;DR: Can3Tok是首个能够将大量高斯基元编码为低维潜在嵌入的3D场景级变分自编码器（VAE），解决了3D场景生成中的尺度不一致问题，并在DL3DV-10K数据集上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D生成技术主要集中在对象级别，而场景级生成由于缺乏能够处理尺度不一致和大规模数据的模型，研究较少。

Method: 提出了Can3Tok，一种3D场景级VAE，能够编码高斯基元为低维潜在嵌入，并设计了一个处理3D场景数据的通用流程。

Result: 在DL3DV-10K数据集上，Can3Tok成功泛化到新场景，而其他方法在训练和推理中均失败。

Conclusion: Can3Tok为3D场景生成提供了有效解决方案，并展示了在图像到3DGS和文本到3DGS生成中的应用潜力。

Abstract: 3D generation has made significant progress, however, it still largely
remains at the object-level. Feedforward 3D scene-level generation has been
rarely explored due to the lack of models capable of scaling-up latent
representation learning on 3D scene-level data. Unlike object-level generative
models, which are trained on well-labeled 3D data in a bounded canonical space,
scene-level generations with 3D scenes represented by 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) are unbounded and exhibit scale inconsistency across different scenes,
making unified latent representation learning for generative purposes extremely
challenging. In this paper, we introduce Can3Tok, the first 3D scene-level
variational autoencoder (VAE) capable of encoding a large number of Gaussian
primitives into a low-dimensional latent embedding, which effectively captures
both semantic and spatial information of the inputs. Beyond model design, we
propose a general pipeline for 3D scene data processing to address scale
inconsistency issue. We validate our method on the recent scene-level 3D
dataset DL3DV-10K, where we found that only Can3Tok successfully generalizes to
novel 3D scenes, while compared methods fail to converge on even a few hundred
scene inputs during training and exhibit zero generalization ability during
inference. Finally, we demonstrate image-to-3DGS and text-to-3DGS generation as
our applications to demonstrate its ability to facilitate downstream generation
tasks.

Conclusion: EfficientGFormer为临床提供了快速、准确且可扩展的肿瘤分割解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient brain tumor segmentation remains a critical challenge
in neuroimaging due to the heterogeneous nature of tumor subregions and the
high computational cost of volumetric inference. In this paper, we propose
EfficientGFormer, a novel architecture that integrates pretrained foundation
models with graph-based reasoning and lightweight efficiency mechanisms for
robust 3D brain tumor segmentation. Our framework leverages nnFormer as a
modality-aware encoder, transforming multi-modal MRI volumes into patch-level
embeddings. These features are structured into a dual-edge graph that captures
both spatial adjacency and semantic similarity. A pruned, edge-type-aware Graph
Attention Network (GAT) enables efficient relational reasoning across tumor
subregions, while a distillation module transfers knowledge from a
full-capacity teacher to a compact student model for real-time deployment.
Experiments on the MSD Task01 and BraTS 2021 datasets demonstrate that
EfficientGFormer achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with significantly reduced
memory and inference time, outperforming recent transformer-based and
graph-based baselines. This work offers a clinically viable solution for fast
and accurate volumetric tumor delineation, combining scalability,
interpretability, and generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在已知生成器上表现良好，但在新兴或未见过的生成器上性能下降，原因是特征嵌入重叠导致跨生成器分类不准确。

Method: MiraGe通过最小化类内变化和最大化类间分离学习生成器不变特征，并结合多模态提示学习优化CLIP模型。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，MiraGe实现了最先进的性能，即使对未见过的生成器（如Sora）也保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MiraGe通过生成器不变特征和多模态学习，显著提升了AI生成图像检测的泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have highlighted the need for robust
detectors capable of distinguishing real images from AI-generated images. While
existing methods perform well on known generators, their performance often
declines when tested with newly emerging or unseen generative models due to
overlapping feature embeddings that hinder accurate cross-generator
classification. In this paper, we propose Multimodal Discriminative
Representation Learning for Generalizable AI-generated Image Detection
(MiraGe), a method designed to learn generator-invariant features. Motivated by
theoretical insights on intra-class variation minimization and inter-class
separation, MiraGe tightly aligns features within the same class while
maximizing separation between classes, enhancing feature discriminability.
Moreover, we apply multimodal prompt learning to further refine these
principles into CLIP, leveraging text embeddings as semantic anchors for
effective discriminative representation learning, thereby improving
generalizability. Comprehensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show
that MiraGe achieves state-of-the-art performance, maintaining robustness even
against unseen generators like Sora.

Conclusion: 渐进式训练方法使小规模模型在视频推理任务中表现优异且计算高效。

Abstract: While recent multimodal models have shown progress in vision-language tasks,
small-scale variants still struggle with the fine-grained temporal reasoning
required for video understanding. We introduce ReasonAct, a method that
enhances video reasoning in smaller models through a three-stage training
process: first building a foundation with text-only reasoning, then fine-tuning
on video, and finally refining with temporal-aware reinforcement learning. We
build upon Temporal Group Relative Policy Optimization (T-GRPO) by
incorporating temporal consistency modeling into policy optimization. We also
propose a biomechanically-motivated sub-action decomposition mechanism that
provides graduated rewards for constituent action phases. Through experiments
on HMDB51, UCF-101, and Kinetics-400, our 3B-parameter model achieves 67.2%,
94.1%, and 78.9% accuracy respectively, demonstrating improvements of 17.9,
15.8, and 12.3 points over baselines. Ablation studies validate that our
progressive training methodology enables smaller models to achieve competitive
video reasoning performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: MagicVL-2B是移动设备上实用的视觉语言解决方案，支持智能手机直接运行高级多模态智能任务。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in
recent years, enabling a diverse array of applications in everyday life.
However, the substantial computational and storage demands of VLMs pose
significant challenges for their efficient deployment on mobile devices, which
represent the most ubiquitous and accessible computing platforms today. In this
work, we introduce MagicVL-2B, a novel VLM meticulously optimized for flagship
smartphones. MagicVL-2B leverages a lightweight visual encoder with fewer than
100M parameters and features a redesigned dynamic resolution scheme that
adaptively generates image tokens without excessive modification of image
dimensions. To further enhance the performance of this compact encoder within
VLMs, we propose a multimodal curriculum learning strategy that incrementally
increases task difficulty and data information density throughout training.
This approach substantially improves the model's performance across a variety
of sub-tasks. Extensive evaluations on standard VLM benchmarks demonstrate that
MagicVL-2B matches the accuracy of current state-of-the-art models while
reducing on-device power consumption by 41.1%. These results establish
MagicVL-2B as a practical and robust solution for real-world mobile
vision-language applications, enabling advanced multimodal intelligence to run
directly on smartphones.

Motivation: 现有视频RAG方法在检索效率和准确性之间难以平衡，尤其是在处理复杂视频内容时。

Method: 提出E-VRAG框架，包括帧预过滤、轻量级VLM评分、全局统计分布检索策略和多视角问答方案。

Result: 在四个公共基准测试中，E-VRAG计算成本降低约70%，且准确性更高。

Conclusion: E-VRAG无需额外训练即可显著提升视频RAG任务的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled substantial progress in video
understanding by leveraging cross-modal reasoning capabilities. However, their
effectiveness is limited by the restricted context window and the high
computational cost required to process long videos with thousands of frames.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses this challenge by selecting only
the most relevant frames as input, thereby reducing the computational burden.
Nevertheless, existing video RAG methods struggle to balance retrieval
efficiency and accuracy, particularly when handling diverse and complex video
content. To address these limitations, we propose E-VRAG, a novel and efficient
video RAG framework for video understanding. We first apply a frame
pre-filtering method based on hierarchical query decomposition to eliminate
irrelevant frames, reducing computational costs at the data level. We then
employ a lightweight VLM for frame scoring, further reducing computational
costs at the model level. Additionally, we propose a frame retrieval strategy
that leverages the global statistical distribution of inter-frame scores to
mitigate the potential performance degradation from using a lightweight VLM.
Finally, we introduce a multi-view question answering scheme for the retrieved
frames, enhancing the VLM's capability to extract and comprehend information
from long video contexts. Experiments on four public benchmarks show that
E-VRAG achieves about 70% reduction in computational cost and higher accuracy
compared to baseline methods, all without additional training. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of E-VRAG in improving both efficiency and
accuracy for video RAG tasks.

Result: 剪枝92.6%视觉标记，性能与基线相当；增强版GlimpsePrune+性能提升至基线的110%。

Conclusion: GlimpsePrune为构建更强大高效的LVLMs提供了新途径。

Abstract: Visual token compression is critical for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
to efficiently process high-resolution inputs. Existing methods that typically
adopt fixed compression ratios cannot adapt to scenes of varying complexity,
often causing imprecise pruning that discards informative visual tokens and
results in degraded model performance. To address this issue, we introduce a
dynamic pruning framework, GlimpsePrune, inspired by human cognition. It takes
a data-driven ''glimpse'' and prunes irrelevant visual tokens in a single
forward pass before answer generation. This approach prunes 92.6% of visual
tokens while on average fully retaining the baseline performance on free-form
VQA tasks. The reduced computational cost also enables more effective
fine-tuning: an enhanced GlimpsePrune+ achieves 110% of the baseline
performance while maintaining a similarly high pruning rate. Our work paves a
new way for building more powerful and efficient LVLMs.

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been exploited in various
Computer Vision tasks (e.g., few-shot recognition) via model adaptation, such
as prompt tuning and adapters. However, existing adaptation methods are
designed by human experts, requiring significant time cost and experience.
Inspired by recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) based code
generation, we propose an Evolutionary Vision-Language Model Adaptation
(EvoVLMA) method to automatically search training-free efficient adaptation
algorithms for VLMs. We recognize feature selection and logits computation as
the key functions in training-free VLM adaptation, and propose a two-stage
LLM-assisted evolutionary algorithm for optimizing these parts in a sequential
manner, effectively addressing the challenge posed by the expansive search
space through a divide-and-conquer strategy. Besides, to enhance the stability
and efficiency of searching process, we propose low-precision code conversion,
web based code execution and process monitoring, leading to a highly effective
automatic algorithm design system. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
algorithms found by EvoVLMA can obtain promising results compared to previous
manually-designed ones. More specifically, in the 8-shot image classification
setting, the classical APE algorithm can be improved by 1.91 points in
recognition accuracy. This research opens new possibilities for automating the
optimization of adaptation algorithms of pre-trained multimodal models. Code is

Motivation: 传统LiDAR传感器在密集扫描时忽略时间连续性，导致冗余和能耗问题，限制了其在资源受限平台上的实用性。

Method: 采用轻量级预测网络和历史上下文嵌入，结合可微分掩码生成器和Gumbel-Softmax采样，生成ROI二进制掩码。

Result: 在nuScenes和Lyft基准测试中，能耗降低65%以上，3D目标检测性能与传统方法相当或更优。

Conclusion: 自适应扫描框架有效解决了LiDAR冗余扫描问题，为资源受限平台提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-sensor fusion using LiDAR and RGB cameras significantly enhances 3D
object detection task. However, conventional LiDAR sensors perform dense,
stateless scans, ignoring the strong temporal continuity in real-world scenes.
This leads to substantial sensing redundancy and excessive power consumption,
limiting their practicality on resource-constrained platforms. To address this
inefficiency, we propose a predictive, history-aware adaptive scanning
framework that anticipates informative regions of interest (ROI) based on past
observations. Our approach introduces a lightweight predictor network that
distills historical spatial and temporal contexts into refined query
embeddings. These embeddings guide a differentiable Mask Generator network,
which leverages Gumbel-Softmax sampling to produce binary masks identifying
critical ROIs for the upcoming frame. Our method significantly reduces
unnecessary data acquisition by concentrating dense LiDAR scanning only within
these ROIs and sparsely sampling elsewhere. Experiments on nuScenes and Lyft
benchmarks demonstrate that our adaptive scanning strategy reduces LiDAR energy
consumption by over 65% while maintaining competitive or even superior 3D
object detection performance compared to traditional LiDAR-camera fusion
methods with dense LiDAR scanning.

Method: 通过选择性掩码实验揭示ViT特性，提出LetheViT方法，利用掩码图像生成正对数，原图生成负对数，实现对比遗忘。

Result: LetheViT在实验中表现优异，有效平衡隐私合规与模型性能。

Conclusion: LetheViT为ViT模型提供了一种高效的近似遗忘方法，解决了隐私法规下的数据遗忘难题。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have revolutionized computer vision tasks with
their exceptional performance. However, the introduction of privacy regulations
such as GDPR and CCPA has brought new challenges to them. These laws grant
users the right to withdraw their data, necessitating not only the deletion of
data but also the complete removal of its influence from trained models.
Machine unlearning emerges as a critical solution, with exact unlearning being
computationally prohibitive and approximate methods offering a more practical
approach. This work addresses the particularly challenging scenario of random
data forgetting in ViTs, where the model must forget specific samples while
retaining others, even within the same class. We first reveal the core
characteristics of ViTs through selective masking experiments: when
high-attention areas are masked, the model retains its recognition capability
but significantly weakens its memorization ability. Based on the above
insights, we propose LetheViT, a contrastive unlearning method tailored for
ViTs. LetheViT uses masked image inputs to generate positive logits and
original image inputs to generate negative logits, guiding the model to forget
specific details while retaining the general cl category outlines. Experimental
results demonstrate that LetheViT achieves state-of-the-art performance,
effectively balancing privacy compliance with model efficacy.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在图像处理中缺乏对拓扑结构的敏感性，而拓扑结构（如连通性和环路）对理解图像内容（如生物医学对象）至关重要。

Method: 利用持久同调（PH）编码图像局部拓扑特征，生成多视角TopoImages，并将其与原始图像融合用于深度学习分类。

Result: 在三个公共医学图像分类数据集上，TopoImages方法显著优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: TopoImages方法为图像数据分析提供了新视角，且能无缝集成到常见深度学习框架中，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Topological structures in image data, such as connected components and loops,
play a crucial role in understanding image content (e.g., biomedical objects).
% Despite remarkable successes of numerous image processing methods that rely
on appearance information, these methods often lack sensitivity to topological
structures when used in general deep learning (DL) frameworks. % In this paper,
we introduce a new general approach, called TopoImages (for Topology Images),
which computes a new representation of input images by encoding local topology
of patches. % In TopoImages, we leverage persistent homology (PH) to encode
geometric and topological features inherent in image patches. % Our main
objective is to capture topological information in local patches of an input
image into a vectorized form. % Specifically, we first compute persistence
diagrams (PDs) of the patches, % and then vectorize and arrange these PDs into
long vectors for pixels of the patches. % The resulting multi-channel
image-form representation is called a TopoImage. % TopoImages offers a new
perspective for data analysis. % To garner diverse and significant topological
features in image data and ensure a more comprehensive and enriched
representation, we further generate multiple TopoImages of the input image
using various filtration functions, which we call multi-view TopoImages. % The
multi-view TopoImages are fused with the input image for DL-based
classification, with considerable improvement. % Our TopoImages approach is
highly versatile and can be seamlessly integrated into common DL frameworks.
Experiments on three public medical image classification datasets demonstrate
noticeably improved accuracy over state-of-the-art methods.

their promise for CL has attracted increasing attention due to their strong
generalizability. However, the potential of rich textual semantic priors in
CLIP in addressing the stability-plasticity dilemma remains underexplored.
During backbone training, most approaches transfer past knowledge without
considering semantic relevance, leading to interference from unrelated tasks
that disrupt the balance between stability and plasticity. Besides, while
text-based classifiers provide strong generalization, they suffer from limited
plasticity due to the inherent modality gap in CLIP. Visual classifiers help
bridge this gap, but their prototypes lack rich and precise semantics. To
address these challenges, we propose Semantic-Enriched Continual Adaptation
(SECA), a unified framework that harnesses the anti-forgetting and structured
nature of textual priors to guide semantic-aware knowledge transfer in the
backbone and reinforce the semantic structure of the visual classifier.
Specifically, a Semantic-Guided Adaptive Knowledge Transfer (SG-AKT) module is
proposed to assess new images' relevance to diverse historical visual knowledge
via textual cues, and aggregate relevant knowledge in an instance-adaptive
manner as distillation signals. Moreover, a Semantic-Enhanced Visual Prototype
Refinement (SE-VPR) module is introduced to refine visual prototypes using
inter-class semantic relations captured in class-wise textual embeddings.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our
approach.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Set Pivot Learning（SPL）的新范式，重新定义了基于视觉基础模型（VFMs）的领域泛化（DG），强调动态适应和VFM为中心的调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce, for the first time, the concept of Set Pivot
Learning, a paradigm shift that redefines domain generalization (DG) based on
Vision Foundation Models (VFMs). Traditional DG assumes that the target domain
is inaccessible during training, but the emergence of VFMs, trained on vast and
diverse data, renders this assumption unclear and obsolete. Traditional DG
assumes that the target domain is inaccessible during training, but the
emergence of VFMs, which are trained on vast and diverse datasets, renders this
assumption unclear and obsolete. To address this challenge, we propose Set
Pivot Learning (SPL), a new definition of domain migration task based on VFMs,
which is more suitable for current research and application requirements.
Unlike conventional DG methods, SPL prioritizes adaptive refinement over rigid
domain transfer, ensuring continuous alignment with evolving real-world
conditions. Specifically, SPL features two key attributes: (i) Dynamic
adaptation, transitioning from static domain alignment to flexible, task-driven
feature optimization, enabling models to evolve with downstream scenarios; (ii)
VFM-centric tuning, leveraging pretrained knowledge as a pivot to hone
task-specific representations while preserving cross-domain robustness.
Building on SPL, we propose a Dynamic Prompt Fine-Tuning method, which combines
a Dynamic Class-aware Prompter with a Prompt-guided Feature Focuser, to elevate
VFM performance in targeted scenarios. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets show the effectiveness of our method, highlighting its superiority
over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in generalized segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在生成连续时间动态和随机运动序列时面临挑战，且容易忽视复杂人体运动的灵活性并导致模式崩溃。

Method: STCN分为两阶段：第一阶段通过时空连续网络生成平滑运动序列并引入锚点集防止模式崩溃；第二阶段学习高斯混合分布并采样多序列以减少类内差异。

Result: 在Human3.6M和HumanEva-I数据集上，STCN在多样性和准确性上表现出竞争力。

Conclusion: STCN通过两阶段设计和锚点集创新，有效解决了随机人体运动预测中的模式崩溃和时间动态问题。

Abstract: Stochastic Human Motion Prediction (HMP) has received increasing attention
due to its wide applications. Despite the rapid progress in generative fields,
existing methods often face challenges in learning continuous temporal dynamics
and predicting stochastic motion sequences. They tend to overlook the
flexibility inherent in complex human motions and are prone to mode collapse.
To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel method called STCN, for
stochastic and continuous human motion prediction, which consists of two
stages. Specifically, in the first stage, we propose a spatio-temporal
continuous network to generate smoother human motion sequences. In addition,
the anchor set is innovatively introduced into the stochastic HMP task to
prevent mode collapse, which refers to the potential human motion patterns. In
the second stage, STCN endeavors to acquire the Gaussian mixture distribution
(GMM) of observed motion sequences with the aid of the anchor set. It also
focuses on the probability associated with each anchor, and employs the
strategy of sampling multiple sequences from each anchor to alleviate
intra-class differences in human motions. Experimental results on two
widely-used datasets (Human3.6M and HumanEva-I) demonstrate that our model
obtains competitive performance on both diversity and accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决终身行人重识别中存储历史样本带来的隐私问题，同时避免因不存储原始数据而导致的性能下降。

Method: 通过将多个真实图像的特征压缩到单个图像中，生成隐私保护的重放样本，并在重放阶段进行双重对齐（当前域与历史域对齐，重放样本与当前域风格对齐）。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Pr^2R比现有方法在序列任务中准确率提高了4%和6%。

Conclusion: Pr^2R在保护数据隐私的同时，有效提升了终身行人重识别的性能。

Abstract: Lifelong person re-identification (LReID) aims to incrementally accumulate
knowledge across a sequence of tasks under domain shifts. Recently,
replay-based methods have demonstrated strong effectiveness in LReID by
rehearsing past samples stored in an auxiliary memory. However, storing
historical exemplars raises concerns over data privacy. To avoid this,
exemplar-free approaches attempt to match the distribution of past data without
storing raw samples. Despite being privacy-friendly, these methods often suffer
from performance degradation due to the forgetting of specific past knowledge
representations. To this end, we propose to condense information from
sequential data into the pixel space in the replay memory, enabling
Privacy-Preserving Replay (Pr^2R). More specifically, by distilling the
training characteristics of multiple real images into a single image, the
condensed samples undergo pixel-level changes. This not only protects the
privacy of the original data but also makes the replay samples more
representative for sequential tasks. During the style replay phase, we align
the current domain to the previous one while simultaneously adapting the replay
samples to match the style of the current domain. This dual-alignment strategy
effectively mitigates both class-incremental challenges and forgetting caused
by domain shifts. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the
proposed method significantly improves replay effectiveness while preserving
data privacy. Specifically, Pr^2R achieves 4% and 6% higher accuracy on
sequential tasks compared to the current state-of-the-art and other
replay-based methods, respectively.

TL;DR: SNARM是一种新型工业异常检测框架，通过自参考学习和动态残差比较提升异常检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖预训练特征，无法动态适应测试图像，SNARM旨在通过自参考学习增强异常判别能力。

Method: 通过计算测试图像块与训练特征库的残差，利用高正常性块生成自参考，结合Mamba模块动态聚焦异常区域。

Result: 在MVTec AD、MVTec 3D和VisA基准测试中，SNARM在各项指标上均达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: SNARM通过自参考学习和动态残差比较，显著提升了工业异常检测的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Self-Navigated Residual Mamba (SNARM), a novel
framework for universal industrial anomaly detection that leverages
``self-referential learning'' within test images to enhance anomaly
discrimination. Unlike conventional methods that depend solely on pre-trained
features from normal training data, SNARM dynamically refines anomaly detection
by iteratively comparing test patches against adaptively selected in-image
references. Specifically, we first compute the ``inter-residuals'' features by
contrasting test image patches with the training feature bank. Patches
exhibiting small-norm residuals (indicating high normality) are then utilized
as self-generated reference patches to compute ``intra-residuals'', amplifying
discriminative signals. These inter- and intra-residual features are
concatenated and fed into a novel Mamba module with multiple heads, which are
dynamically navigated by residual properties to focus on anomalous regions.
Finally, AD results are obtained by aggregating the outputs of a self-navigated
Mamba in an ensemble learning paradigm. Extensive experiments on MVTec AD,
MVTec 3D, and VisA benchmarks demonstrate that SNARM achieves state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance, with notable improvements in all metrics, including
Image-AUROC, Pixel-AURC, PRO, and AP.

Result: 在五个基准测试中达到SOTA性能，仅需0.93M可训练参数。

Conclusion: DMTrack通过双适配器架构有效提升了多模态跟踪性能，具有高效性和可扩展性。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore adapter tuning and introduce a novel dual-adapter
architecture for spatio-temporal multimodal tracking, dubbed DMTrack. The key
of our DMTrack lies in two simple yet effective modules, including a
spatio-temporal modality adapter (STMA) and a progressive modality
complementary adapter (PMCA) module. The former, applied to each modality
alone, aims to adjust spatio-temporal features extracted from a frozen backbone
by self-prompting, which to some extent can bridge the gap between different
modalities and thus allows better cross-modality fusion. The latter seeks to
facilitate cross-modality prompting progressively with two specially designed
pixel-wise shallow and deep adapters. The shallow adapter employs shared
parameters between the two modalities, aiming to bridge the information flow
between the two modality branches, thereby laying the foundation for following
modality fusion, while the deep adapter modulates the preliminarily fused
information flow with pixel-wise inner-modal attention and further generates
modality-aware prompts through pixel-wise inter-modal attention. With such
designs, DMTrack achieves promising spatio-temporal multimodal tracking
performance with merely \textbf{0.93M} trainable parameters. Extensive
experiments on five benchmarks show that DMTrack achieves state-of-the-art
results. Code will be available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态医疗数据中类别不平衡问题，现有方法易过拟合或欠拟合且难以捕捉跨模态交互。

Method: 设计多模态课程测量器和类别分布引导的训练调度器，逐步适应不平衡分布。

Result: 在多个多模态医疗数据集上表现优于现有方法，且易于集成到其他模型。

Conclusion: CLIMD为提升多模态疾病诊断准确性提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Clinicians usually combine information from multiple sources to achieve the
most accurate diagnosis, and this has sparked increasing interest in leveraging
multimodal deep learning for diagnosis. However, in real clinical scenarios,
due to differences in incidence rates, multimodal medical data commonly face
the issue of class imbalance, which makes it difficult to adequately learn the
features of minority classes. Most existing methods tackle this issue with
resampling or loss reweighting, but they are prone to overfitting or
underfitting and fail to capture cross-modal interactions. Therefore, we
propose a Curriculum Learning framework for Imbalanced Multimodal Diagnosis
(CLIMD). Specifically, we first design multimodal curriculum measurer that
combines two indicators, intra-modal confidence and inter-modal
complementarity, to enable the model to focus on key samples and gradually
adapt to complex category distributions. Additionally, a class
distribution-guided training scheduler is introduced, which enables the model
to progressively adapt to the imbalanced class distribution during training.
Extensive experiments on multiple multimodal medical datasets demonstrate that
the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across various
metrics and excels in handling imbalanced multimodal medical data. Furthermore,
as a plug-and-play CL framework, CLIMD can be easily integrated into other
models, offering a promising path for improving multimodal disease diagnosis
accuracy. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/KHan-UJS/CLIMD.

Motivation: 脑肿瘤亚型的细粒度分类因形态学差异细微和标注数据稀缺而具有挑战性，现有视觉语言模型在细粒度特征捕捉上表现不足。

Method: FG-PAN包含局部特征优化模块（增强视觉特征）和细粒度文本描述生成模块（利用大语言模型生成语义原型），通过特征对齐提高分类能力。

Result: 在多个公共病理数据集上，FG-PAN实现了最先进的零样本分类性能，并表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: FG-PAN通过结合视觉和语义特征，显著提升了脑肿瘤亚型分类的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: The fine-grained classification of brain tumor subtypes from
histopathological whole slide images is highly challenging due to subtle
morphological variations and the scarcity of annotated data. Although
vision-language models have enabled promising zero-shot classification, their
ability to capture fine-grained pathological features remains limited,
resulting in suboptimal subtype discrimination. To address these challenges, we
propose the Fine-Grained Patch Alignment Network (FG-PAN), a novel zero-shot
framework tailored for digital pathology. FG-PAN consists of two key modules:
(1) a local feature refinement module that enhances patch-level visual features
by modeling spatial relationships among representative patches, and (2) a
fine-grained text description generation module that leverages large language
models to produce pathology-aware, class-specific semantic prototypes. By
aligning refined visual features with LLM-generated fine-grained descriptions,
FG-PAN effectively increases class separability in both visual and semantic
spaces. Extensive experiments on multiple public pathology datasets, including
EBRAINS and TCGA, demonstrate that FG-PAN achieves state-of-the-art performance
and robust generalization in zero-shot brain tumor subtype classification.

Motivation: 现有方法在处理未知生成器的伪造图像时泛化能力不足，需要更灵活的解决方案。

Method: IAPL包含两个自适应模块：条件信息学习器和置信驱动自适应预测，通过动态调整输入提示提升模型适应性。

Result: 在UniversalFakeDetect和GenImage数据集上分别达到95.61%和96.7%的平均准确率。

Conclusion: IAPL通过自适应机制显著提升了检测性能，适用于多样化的伪造图像检测。

Abstract: A major struggle for AI-generated image detection is identifying fake images
from unseen generators. Existing cutting-edge methods typically customize
pre-trained foundation models to this task via partial-parameter fine-tuning.
However, these parameters trained on a narrow range of generators may fail to
generalize to unknown sources. In light of this, we propose a novel framework
named Image-Adaptive Prompt Learning (IAPL), which enhances flexibility in
processing diverse testing images. It consists of two adaptive modules, i.e.,
the Conditional Information Learner and the Confidence-Driven Adaptive
Prediction. The former employs CNN-based feature extractors to learn
forgery-specific and image-specific conditions, which are then propagated to
learnable tokens via a gated mechanism. The latter optimizes the shallowest
learnable tokens based on a single test sample and selects the cropped view
with the highest prediction confidence for final detection. These two modules
enable the prompts fed into the foundation model to be automatically adjusted
based on the input image, rather than being fixed after training, thereby
enhancing the model's adaptability to various forged images. Extensive
experiments show that IAPL achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 95.61%
and 96.7% mean accuracy on two widely used UniversalFakeDetect and GenImage
datasets, respectively.

Method: 通过IMAGEO-Bench基准，评估10种LLMs在三个数据集上的准确性、距离误差、地理偏见和推理过程。

Result: 闭源模型表现更优，但存在对高资源地区（如北美、西欧）的偏见，成功定位依赖于识别城市环境、地标等特征。

Conclusion: IMAGEO-Bench为LLMs的空间推理能力提供了严谨评估，并为构建地理感知AI系统提供了启示。

Abstract: Image geolocalization, the task of identifying the geographic location
depicted in an image, is important for applications in crisis response, digital
forensics, and location-based intelligence. While recent advances in large
language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for visual reasoning, their
ability to perform image geolocalization remains underexplored. In this study,
we introduce a benchmark called IMAGEO-Bench that systematically evaluates
accuracy, distance error, geospatial bias, and reasoning process. Our benchmark
includes three diverse datasets covering global street scenes, points of
interest (POIs) in the United States, and a private collection of unseen
images. Through experiments on 10 state-of-the-art LLMs, including both open-
and closed-source models, we reveal clear performance disparities, with
closed-source models generally showing stronger reasoning. Importantly, we
uncover geospatial biases as LLMs tend to perform better in high-resource
regions (e.g., North America, Western Europe, and California) while exhibiting
degraded performance in underrepresented areas. Regression diagnostics
demonstrate that successful geolocalization is primarily dependent on
recognizing urban settings, outdoor environments, street-level imagery, and
identifiable landmarks. Overall, IMAGEO-Bench provides a rigorous lens into the
spatial reasoning capabilities of LLMs and offers implications for building
geolocation-aware AI systems.

Abstract: Autoregressive models (ARMs) have long dominated the landscape of biomedical

have emerged as promising alternatives, yet their application in the biomedical
domain remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce
\textbf{LLaDA-MedV}, the first large language diffusion model tailored for
biomedical image understanding through vision instruction tuning. LLaDA-MedV
achieves relative performance gains of 7.855\% over LLaVA-Med and 1.867\% over
LLaDA-V in the open-ended biomedical visual conversation task, and sets new
state-of-the-art accuracy on the closed-form subset of three VQA benchmarks:
84.93\% on VQA-RAD, 92.31\% on SLAKE, and 95.15\% on PathVQA. Furthermore, a
detailed comparison with LLaVA-Med suggests that LLaDA-MedV is capable of
generating reasonably longer responses by explicitly controlling response
length, which can lead to more informative outputs. We also conduct an in-depth
analysis of both the training and inference stages, highlighting the critical
roles of initialization weight selection, fine-tuning strategies, and the
interplay between sampling steps and response repetition. The code and model

Abstract: We address the problem of glass surface segmentation with an RGB-D camera,
with a focus on effectively fusing RGB and depth information. To this end, we
propose a Weighted Feature Fusion (WFF) module that dynamically and adaptively

various deep neural network backbones as a plug-and-play solution.
Additionally, we introduce the MJU-Glass dataset, a comprehensive RGB-D dataset
collected by a service robot navigating real-world environments, providing a
valuable benchmark for evaluating segmentation models. Experimental results
show significant improvements in segmentation accuracy and robustness, with the
WFF module enhancing performance in both mean Intersection over Union (mIoU)

with PSPNet. The proposed module and dataset provide a robust framework for
advancing glass surface segmentation in robotics and reducing the risk of

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全切片图像（WSI）分析面临高分辨率和稀疏诊断区域的挑战。现有方法多关注聚合器设计，而忽略了特征提取器的域差距问题。自监督学习虽有助于缩小域差距，但仍依赖通用骨干网络，导致冗余和训练成本高。

Method: 提出CDSR框架，采用两阶段选择性采样策略，从模型和语义角度选择最具信息量的区域，并通过局部到全局网络重建高分辨率WSI表示。

Result: 在Camelyon16、TCGA-NSCLC和TCGA-RCC数据集上，CDSR仅需平均7,070个高分辨率补丁（占总数的4.5%），在下游分类任务中准确率和ROC曲线下面积分别提升6.3%和5.5%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CDSR通过高效选择信息量高的区域和双尺度重建，显著提升了WSI分析的效率和性能，为医学图像分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: Whole-slide image (WSI) analysis remains challenging due to the gigapixel
scale and sparsely distributed diagnostic regions. Multiple Instance Learning
(MIL) mitigates this by modeling the WSI as bags of patches for slide-level
prediction. However, most MIL approaches emphasize aggregator design while
overlooking the impact of the feature extractor of the feature extraction
stage, which is often pretrained on natural images. This leads to domain gap
and suboptimal representations. Self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown
promise in bridging domain gap via pretext tasks, but it still primarily builds
upon generic backbones, thus requiring WSIs to be split into small patches.
This inevitably splits histological structures and generates both redundant and
interdependent patches, which in turn degrades aggregator performance and
drastically increases training costs. To address this challenge, we propose a
Cascaded Dual-Scale Reconstruction (CDSR) framework, demonstrating that only an
average of 9 high-resolution patches per WSI are sufficient for robust
slide-level representation. CDSR employs a two-stage selective sampling
strategy that identifies the most informative representative regions from both
model-based and semantic perspectives. These patches are then fed into a
Local-to-Global Network, which reconstructs spatially coherent high-resolution
WSI representations by integrating fine-grained local detail with global
contextual information. Unlike existing dense-sampling or SSL pipelines, CDSR
is optimized for efficiency and morphological fidelity. Experiments on
Camelyon16, TCGA-NSCLC, and TCGA-RCC demonstrate that CDSR achieves
improvements of 6.3% in accuracy and 5.5% in area under ROC curve on downstream
classification tasks with only 7,070 (4.5% of total) high-resolution patches
per dataset on average, outperforming state-of-the-art methods trained on over
10,000,000 patches.

challenges, such as modeling complex strand interactions and diverse sketch
patterns, through two main innovations: a learnable strand upsampling strategy
that encodes 3D strands into multi-scale latent spaces, and a multi-scale
adaptive conditioning mechanism using a transformer with diffusion heads to
ensure consistency across granularity levels. Experiments on several benchmark
datasets show our method outperforms existing approaches in realism and
precision. Qualitative results further confirm its effectiveness. Code will be

Abstract: 3D object affordance grounding aims to predict the touchable regions on a 3d
object, which is crucial for human-object interaction, human-robot interaction,
embodied perception, and robot learning. Recent advances tackle this problem
via learning from demonstration images. However, these methods fail to capture
the general affordance knowledge within the image, leading to poor
generalization. To address this issue, we propose to use text-to-image
diffusion models to extract the general affordance knowledge because we find
that such models can generate semantically valid HOI images, which demonstrate
that their internal representation space is highly correlated with real-world
affordance concepts. Specifically, we introduce the DAG, a diffusion-based 3d
affordance grounding framework, which leverages the frozen internal
representations of the text-to-image diffusion model and unlocks affordance
knowledge within the diffusion model to perform 3D affordance grounding. We
further introduce an affordance block and a multi-source affordance decoder to
endow 3D dense affordance prediction. Extensive experimental evaluations show
that our model excels over well-established methods and exhibits open-world
generalization.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在生成内容时存在幻觉问题，即内容语法正确但与视觉输入不一致。

Method: 采用层间交叉注意力（Layer-Wise Criss-Cross Attention）和全局-局部对数融合机制（Global-Local Logit Fusion）优化解码过程。

Result: 在POPE、MME和MMHal-Bench等基准测试中显著提升了模型的真实性和性能。

Conclusion: 语义地图级别的解码策略能有效减少幻觉问题，提升模型表现。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive performance in
multimodal tasks, but they still suffer from hallucinations, i.e., generating
content that is grammatically accurate but inconsistent with visual inputs. In
this work, we introduce a novel map-level perspective to mitigate
hallucinations in LVLMs, interpreting the hidden states of the model as a 2D
semantic map. We observe that factual information is widely distributed across
this map, extending beyond the localized inter- or intra-layer regions targeted
by most existing methods (e.g., contrastive decoding and layer-wise
consistency). Building on this insight, we propose Map-Level Attention
Processing (MAP), a training-free decoding method that effectively leverages
factual information through attention-based map-level operations to improve
factual consistency. Specifically, we employ Layer-Wise Criss-Cross Attention
to progressively refine token representations at each decoding layer by
aggregating tokens from both inter- and intra-layer dimensions. Additionally, a
Global-Local Logit Fusion mechanism combines logits obtained before and after
global attention to further refine predictions and improve accuracy. Our method
consistently improves the truthfulness and performance of LVLMs across
benchmarks, such as POPE, MME, and MMHal-Bench, demonstrating the potential of
the map-level decoding strategy.

*Zhixuan Li,Yujia Liu,Chen Hui,Weisi Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VELA是一种基于速度驱动的水平集方法，用于从点提示中实现端到端的模态分割，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模态分割方法依赖强提示（如可见掩码或边界框），成本高且不实用；同时缺乏几何解释性。

Method: VELA通过可微分网络预测形状特定的运动场，驱动水平集函数逐步演化为最终模态掩码。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，VELA仅需单点提示即优于现有强提示方法。

Conclusion: VELA通过可解释的几何建模，在弱提示下实现了高效模态分割。

Abstract: Amodal segmentation aims to recover complete object shapes, including
occluded regions with no visual appearance, whereas conventional segmentation
focuses solely on visible areas. Existing methods typically rely on strong
prompts, such as visible masks or bounding boxes, which are costly or
impractical to obtain in real-world settings. While recent approaches such as
the Segment Anything Model (SAM) support point-based prompts for guidance, they
often perform direct mask regression without explicitly modeling shape
evolution, limiting generalization in complex occlusion scenarios. Moreover,
most existing methods suffer from a black-box nature, lacking geometric
interpretability and offering limited insight into how occluded shapes are
inferred. To deal with these limitations, we propose VELA, an end-to-end
VElocity-driven Level-set Amodal segmentation method that performs explicit
contour evolution from point-based prompts. VELA first constructs an initial
level set function from image features and the point input, which then
progressively evolves into the final amodal mask under the guidance of a
shape-specific motion field predicted by a fully differentiable network. This
network learns to generate evolution dynamics at each step, enabling
geometrically grounded and topologically flexible contour modeling. Extensive
experiments on COCOA-cls, D2SA, and KINS benchmarks demonstrate that VELA
outperforms existing strongly prompted methods while requiring only a
single-point prompt, validating the effectiveness of interpretable geometric
modeling under weak guidance. The code will be publicly released.

Motivation: 现有方法难以处理复杂遮挡和极端形状变化，ShapeMoE通过专家分工解决这一问题。

Method: ShapeMoE学习潜在形状分布空间，动态路由对象到轻量级专家，每个专家专注于特定形状模式。

Result: 在COCOA-cls、KINS和D2SA数据集上，ShapeMoE表现优于现有方法，尤其在遮挡区域分割上。

Conclusion: ShapeMoE通过形状感知路由和专家分工，实现了高效、高容量的模态分割。

Abstract: Amodal segmentation targets to predict complete object masks, covering both
visible and occluded regions. This task poses significant challenges due to
complex occlusions and extreme shape variation, from rigid furniture to highly
deformable clothing. Existing one-size-fits-all approaches rely on a single
model to handle all shape types, struggling to capture and reason about diverse
amodal shapes due to limited representation capacity. A natural solution is to
adopt a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework, assigning experts to different
shape patterns. However, naively applying MoE without considering the object's
underlying shape distribution can lead to mismatched expert routing and
insufficient expert specialization, resulting in redundant or underutilized
experts. To deal with these issues, we introduce ShapeMoE, a shape-specific
sparse Mixture-of-Experts framework for amodal segmentation. The key idea is to
learn a latent shape distribution space and dynamically route each object to a
lightweight expert tailored to its shape characteristics. Specifically,
ShapeMoE encodes each object into a compact Gaussian embedding that captures
key shape characteristics. A Shape-Aware Sparse Router then maps the object to
the most suitable expert, enabling precise and efficient shape-aware expert
routing. Each expert is designed as lightweight and specialized in predicting
occluded regions for specific shape patterns. ShapeMoE offers well
interpretability via clear shape-to-expert correspondence, while maintaining
high capacity and efficiency. Experiments on COCOA-cls, KINS, and D2SA show
that ShapeMoE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in
occluded region segmentation. The code will be released.

TL;DR: Rein++是一个基于视觉基础模型（VFM）的高效语义分割框架，通过域泛化（Rein-G）和域适应（Rein-A）解决数据规模差异和域分布偏移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决VFM在语义分割中面临的数据规模小和域分布多样化的挑战。

Method: Rein++结合了Rein-G（实例感知令牌优化特征）和Rein-A（实例和逻辑级别的无监督域适应），并利用Segment Anything模型增强边界细节。

Result: Rein++在高效训练下显著优于现有方法，适用于大规模模型。

Conclusion: Rein++是一个高效、泛化性强且适应性强的VFM分割解决方案。

Abstract: Vision Foundation Models(VFMs) have achieved remarkable success in various
computer vision tasks. However, their application to semantic segmentation is
hindered by two significant challenges: (1) the disparity in data scale, as
segmentation datasets are typically much smaller than those used for VFM
pre-training, and (2) domain distribution shifts, where real-world segmentation
scenarios are diverse and often underrepresented during pre-training. To
overcome these limitations, we present Rein++, an efficient VFM-based
segmentation framework that demonstrates superior generalization from limited
data and enables effective adaptation to diverse unlabeled scenarios.
Specifically, Rein++ comprises a domain generalization solution Rein-G and a
domain adaptation solution Rein-A. Rein-G introduces a set of trainable,
instance-aware tokens that effectively refine the VFM's features for the
segmentation task. This parameter-efficient approach fine-tunes less than 1% of
the backbone's parameters, enabling robust generalization. Building on the
Rein-G, Rein-A performs unsupervised domain adaptation at both the instance and
logit levels to mitigate domain shifts. In addition, it incorporates a semantic
transfer module that leverages the class-agnostic capabilities of the segment
anything model to enhance boundary details in the target domain. The integrated
Rein++ pipeline first learns a generalizable model on a source domain (e.g.,
daytime scenes) and subsequently adapts it to diverse target domains (e.g.,
nighttime scenes) without any target labels. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that Rein++ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods with
efficient training, underscoring its roles an efficient, generalizable, and
adaptive segmentation solution for VFMs, even for large models with billions of
parameters. The code is available at https://github.com/wloves/Rein.

Method: 构建PatchMap基准，评估1.5亿次前向传递，提出基于分割的补丁放置启发式方法。

Result: PatchMap揭示了小补丁在特定区域的高效攻击性，提出的方法将攻击成功率提升8-13个百分点。

Conclusion: PatchMap为位置感知防御和自适应攻击研究提供了重要工具，未来将发布更全面的基准数据。

Abstract: Adversarial patch attacks threaten the reliability of modern vision models.
We present PatchMap, the first spatially exhaustive benchmark of patch
placement, built by evaluating over 1.5e8 forward passes on ImageNet validation
images. PatchMap reveals systematic hot-spots where small patches (as little as
2% of the image) induce confident misclassifications and large drops in model
confidence. To demonstrate its utility, we propose a simple segmentation guided
placement heuristic that leverages off the shelf masks to identify vulnerable
regions without any gradient queries. Across five architectures-including
adversarially trained ResNet50, our method boosts attack success rates by 8 to
13 percentage points compared to random or fixed placements. We publicly
release PatchMap and the code implementation. The full PatchMap bench (6.5B
predictions, multiple backbones) will be released soon to further accelerate
research on location-aware defenses and adaptive attacks.

TL;DR: Prompt-in-Image方法将文本指令嵌入图像中，统一通过视觉通道处理信息，显著提升了Qwen2.5-VL的性能，但导致LLaVA-1.5和InstructBLIP性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型（VLMs）因多模态信息对齐问题导致的幻觉现象。

Method: 提出Prompt-in-Image方法，将文本指令直接嵌入图像，强制模型通过视觉通道处理所有内容。

Result: Qwen2.5-VL性能提升（POPE准确率提高4.1%），而LLaVA-1.5和InstructBLIP性能大幅下降。

Conclusion: Prompt-in-Image方法对某些VLMs有效，但需注意模型视觉编码器的适应性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often suffer from hallucination, partly due to
challenges in aligning multimodal information. We propose Prompt-in-Image, a
simple method that embeds textual instructions directly into images. This
removes the need for separate text inputs and forces the model to process all
content through the visual channel. We evaluate this method on three popular
open-source VLMs: Qwen2.5-VL, LLaVA-1.5, and InstructBLIP. The results reveal
sharp differences. Prompt-in-Image improves Qwen2.5-VL's performance,
increasing POPE accuracy by 4.1 percent (from 80.2 percent to 84.3 percent) and
also reducing hallucination rates on MS-COCO. In contrast, LLaVA-1.5 and
InstructBLIP experience a severe performance drop, with accuracy falling from
around 84 percent to near-random levels. Through detailed analysis, we found
that CLIP-based encoders in LLaVA and InstructBLIP exhibit excessive attention
bias toward embedded text regions, disrupting visual understanding. In
contrast, Qwen's vision encoder handles text-embedded images robustly.
Crucially, Prompt-in-Image reduces Qwen's modality gap, enhancing cross-modal
alignment by unifying information processing through a single modality.

<details>

Motivation: 扩散模型在2D图像生成和编辑中表现优异，但在3D编辑中保持多视角一致性仍具挑战性。现有方法存在收敛慢、模糊伪影和细粒度不一致等问题。

Method: DisCo3D首先通过多视角输入微调3D生成器以适应场景，然后通过一致性蒸馏训练2D编辑器，最后通过高斯泼溅优化编辑后的多视角输出为3D表示。

Result: 实验表明，DisCo3D在多视角一致性上表现稳定，编辑质量优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DisCo3D有效解决了3D编辑中的多视角一致性问题，提升了编辑质量和效率。

Abstract: While diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable progress in 2D image
generation and editing, extending these capabilities to 3D editing remains
challenging, particularly in maintaining multi-view consistency. Classical
approaches typically update 3D representations through iterative refinement
based on a single editing view. However, these methods often suffer from slow
convergence and blurry artifacts caused by cross-view inconsistencies. Recent
methods improve efficiency by propagating 2D editing attention features, yet
still exhibit fine-grained inconsistencies and failure modes in complex scenes
due to insufficient constraints. To address this, we propose \textbf{DisCo3D},
a novel framework that distills 3D consistency priors into a 2D editor. Our
method first fine-tunes a 3D generator using multi-view inputs for scene
adaptation, then trains a 2D editor through consistency distillation. The
edited multi-view outputs are finally optimized into 3D representations via
Gaussian Splatting. Experimental results show DisCo3D achieves stable
multi-view consistency and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in editing
quality.

<details>

Motivation: 传统区域级对应表示需要先分割ROI再匹配，步骤繁琐。本文旨在简化这一过程，直接通过提示搜索实现高效配准。

Method: 1. 提出“对应提示问题”，寻找图像间的对应提示；2. 提出“逆向提示”解决方案，生成主提示和辅助提示；3. 设计新算法，通过提示和空间维度边缘化实现多ROI匹配。

Result: 在5种应用中（3D前列腺MR、3D腹部MR等），PromptReg在Dice和目标配准误差上优于传统和基于学习的方法，甚至接近需要全标注数据的弱监督方法。

Conclusion: PromptReg通过提示搜索简化了区域级配准，无需训练即可实现高效性能，为图像配准提供了新思路。

Abstract: Establishing pixel/voxel-level or region-level correspondences is the core
challenge in image registration. The latter, also known as region-based
correspondence representation, leverages paired regions of interest (ROIs) to
enable regional matching while preserving fine-grained capability at
pixel/voxel level. Traditionally, this representation is implemented via two
steps: segmenting ROIs in each image then matching them between the two images.
In this paper, we simplify this into one step by directly "searching for
corresponding prompts", using extensively pre-trained segmentation models
(e.g., SAM) for a training-free registration approach, PromptReg. Firstly, we
introduce the "corresponding prompt problem", which aims to identify a
corresponding Prompt Y in Image Y for any given visual Prompt X in Image X,
such that the two respectively prompt-conditioned segmentations are a pair of
corresponding ROIs from the two images. Secondly, we present an "inverse
prompt" solution that generates primary and optionally auxiliary prompts,
inverting Prompt X into the prompt space of Image Y. Thirdly, we propose a
novel registration algorithm that identifies multiple paired corresponding ROIs
by marginalizing the inverted Prompt X across both prompt and spatial
dimensions. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on five applications of
registering 3D prostate MR, 3D abdomen MR, 3D lung CT, 2D histopathology and,
as a non-medical example, 2D aerial images. Based on metrics including Dice and
target registration errors on anatomical structures, the proposed registration
outperforms both intensity-based iterative algorithms and learning-based
DDF-predicting networks, even yielding competitive performance with
weakly-supervised approaches that require fully-segmented training data.

Method: VTG采用插值初始化、双向运动微调和表示对齐正则化，优化预训练模型的运动平滑性和生成保真度。

Result: VTG在TransitBench基准测试中表现优异，适用于概念混合和场景过渡任务。

Conclusion: VTG为统一过渡生成研究提供了有效框架，并在实验中展现出卓越性能。

Abstract: Leveraging text, images, structure maps, or motion trajectories as
conditional guidance, diffusion models have achieved great success in automated
and high-quality video generation. However, generating smooth and rational
transition videos given the first and last video frames as well as descriptive
text prompts is far underexplored. We present VTG, a Versatile Transition video
Generation framework that can generate smooth, high-fidelity, and semantically
coherent video transitions. VTG introduces interpolation-based initialization
that helps preserve object identity and handle abrupt content changes
effectively. In addition, it incorporates dual-directional motion fine-tuning
and representation alignment regularization to mitigate the limitations of
pre-trained image-to-video diffusion models in motion smoothness and generation
fidelity, respectively. To evaluate VTG and facilitate future studies on
unified transition generation, we collected TransitBench, a comprehensive
benchmark for transition generation covering two representative transition
tasks: concept blending and scene transition. Extensive experiments show that
VTG achieves superior transition performance consistently across all four
tasks.

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to precisely identify video event
segments in response to textual queries. The outputs of VTG tasks manifest as
sequences of events, each defined by precise timestamps, saliency scores, and
textual descriptions. Despite recent advances, a fundamental limitation
persists in existing Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs): they process all
task tokens through identical and static pathways, failing to recognize that
temporal localization, saliency assessment, and textual generation represent
fundamentally distinct tasks requiring specialized processing. To address this,
we introduce TimeExpert, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based Video-LLM that
effectively decomposes VTG tasks by dynamically routing task-specific tokens
(e.g., timestamps, saliency scores) to specialized experts, with increased
computational efficiency. Our design choices enable precise handling of each
subtask, leading to improved event modeling across diverse VTG applications.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeExpert consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance on various VTG tasks such as Dense Video
Captioning, Moment Retrieval, and Video Highlight Detection.

Conclusion: LT-Gaussian充分利用新旧场景信息，优于从头重建地图的策略，代码已开源。

Abstract: Maps play an important role in autonomous driving systems. The recently
proposed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) produces rendering-quality explicit
scene reconstruction results, demonstrating the potential for map construction
in autonomous driving scenarios. However, because of the time and computational
costs involved in generating Gaussian scenes, how to update the map becomes a
significant challenge. In this paper, we propose LT-Gaussian, a map update
method for 3D-GS-based maps. LT-Gaussian consists of three main components:
Multimodal Gaussian Splatting, Structural Change Detection Module, and
Gaussian-Map Update Module. Firstly, the Gaussian map of the old scene is
generated using our proposed Multimodal Gaussian Splatting. Subsequently,
during the map update process, we compare the outdated Gaussian map with the
current LiDAR data stream to identify structural changes. Finally, we perform
targeted updates to the Gaussian-map to generate an up-to-date map. We
establish a benchmark for map updating on the nuScenes dataset to
quantitatively evaluate our method. The experimental results show that
LT-Gaussian can effectively and efficiently update the Gaussian-map, handling
common environmental changes in autonomous driving scenarios. Furthermore, by
taking full advantage of information from both new and old scenes, LT-Gaussian
is able to produce higher quality reconstruction results compared to map update
strategies that reconstruct maps from scratch. Our open-source code is
available at https://github.com/ChengLuqi/LT-gaussian.

Result: 在MSR-VTT、DiDeMo、LSMDC和VATEX数据集上取得了最先进的检索效果，并显著提升了效率。

Conclusion: GAID通过融合和扰动模块的互补作用，实现了更稳定和表达性更强的多模态表示。

Abstract: Text-to-video retrieval requires precise alignment between language and
temporally rich video signals. Existing methods predominantly exploit visual
cues and often overlook complementary audio semantics or adopt coarse fusion
strategies, leading to suboptimal multimodal representations. We present GAID,
a framework that jointly address this gap via two key components: (i) a
Frame-level Gated Fusion (FGF) that adaptively integrates audio and visual
features under textual guidance, enabling fine-grained temporal alignment; and
(ii) a Directional Adaptive Semantic Perturbation (DASP) that injects
structure-aware perturbations into text embeddings, enhancing robustness and
discrimination without incurring multi-pass inference. These modules complement
each other -- fusion reduces modality gaps while perturbation regularizes
cross-modal matching -- yielding more stable and expressive representations.
Extensive experiments on MSR-VTT, DiDeMo, LSMDC, and VATEX show consistent
state-of-the-art results across all retrieval metrics with notable efficiency
gains. Our code is available at https://github.com/YangBowenn/GAID.

Abstract: Robot-assisted surgeries rely on accurate and real-time scene understanding
to safely guide surgical instruments. However, segmentation models trained on
static datasets face key limitations when deployed in these dynamic and
evolving surgical environments. Class-incremental semantic segmentation (CISS)
allows models to continually adapt to new classes while avoiding catastrophic
forgetting of prior knowledge, without training on previous data. In this work,
we build upon the recently introduced Taxonomy-Oriented Poincar\'e-regularized
Incremental Class Segmentation (TOPICS) approach and propose an enhanced
variant, termed TOPICS+, specifically tailored for robust segmentation of
surgical scenes. Concretely, we incorporate the Dice loss into the hierarchical
loss formulation to handle strong class imbalances, introduce hierarchical
pseudo-labeling, and design tailored label taxonomies for robotic surgery
environments. We also propose six novel CISS benchmarks designed for robotic
surgery environments including multiple incremental steps and several semantic
categories to emulate realistic class-incremental settings in surgical
environments. In addition, we introduce a refined set of labels with more than
144 classes on the Syn-Mediverse synthetic dataset, hosted online as an
evaluation benchmark. We make the code and trained models publicly available at
http://topics.cs.uni-freiburg.de.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度视觉模型的分布式表示使得定位特定视觉概念的编码位置具有挑战性，需要一种有效的方法来发现相关电路。

Method: GCC方法通过迭代评估神经元间的功能依赖和语义对齐，构建与查询相关的概念电路。

Result: GCC能够自动发现多个精细电路，验证了其在多种深度图像分类模型中的通用性和有效性。

Conclusion: GCC为模型提供了概念层面的解释，首次实现了精细视觉概念相关电路的识别。

Abstract: Deep vision models have achieved remarkable classification performance by
leveraging a hierarchical architecture in which human-interpretable concepts
emerge through the composition of individual neurons across layers. Given the
distributed nature of representations, pinpointing where specific visual
concepts are encoded within a model remains a crucial yet challenging task. In
this paper, we introduce an effective circuit discovery method, called Granular
Concept Circuit (GCC), in which each circuit represents a concept relevant to a
given query. To construct each circuit, our method iteratively assesses
inter-neuron connectivity, focusing on both functional dependencies and
semantic alignment. By automatically discovering multiple circuits, each
capturing specific concepts within that query, our approach offers a profound,
concept-wise interpretation of models and is the first to identify circuits
tied to specific visual concepts at a fine-grained level. We validate the
versatility and effectiveness of GCCs across various deep image classification
models.

TL;DR: AMOT是一种多目标跟踪方法，通过结合外观和运动线索，解决了无人机视频中视角变化和复杂运动带来的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机视频中的视角变化和复杂运动导致身份关联不稳定，现有方法未能充分利用外观和运动的时空交互。

Method: 提出AMOT，包含外观-运动一致性矩阵（AMC）和运动感知轨迹延续模块（MTC），联合利用外观和运动线索。

Result: 在三个无人机基准测试中表现优于现有方法，且无需训练即可泛化。

Conclusion: AMOT通过外观和运动的联合建模，显著提升了多目标跟踪性能。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) aims to track multiple objects while maintaining
consistent identities across frames of a given video. In unmanned aerial
vehicle (UAV) recorded videos, frequent viewpoint changes and complex
UAV-ground relative motion dynamics pose significant challenges, which often
lead to unstable affinity measurement and ambiguous association. Existing
methods typically model motion and appearance cues separately, overlooking
their spatio-temporal interplay and resulting in suboptimal tracking
performance. In this work, we propose AMOT, which jointly exploits appearance
and motion cues through two key components: an Appearance-Motion Consistency
(AMC) matrix and a Motion-aware Track Continuation (MTC) module. Specifically,
the AMC matrix computes bi-directional spatial consistency under the guidance
of appearance features, enabling more reliable and context-aware identity
association. The MTC module complements AMC by reactivating unmatched tracks
through appearance-guided predictions that align with Kalman-based predictions,
thereby reducing broken trajectories caused by missed detections. Extensive
experiments on three UAV benchmarks, including VisDrone2019, UAVDT, and
VT-MOT-UAV, demonstrate that our AMOT outperforms current state-of-the-art
methods and generalizes well in a plug-and-play and training-free manner.

TL;DR: SpectralX是一种参数高效微调框架，通过两阶段训练方法，将现有遥感基础模型（RSFMs）适应于多光谱/高光谱数据，显著提升领域泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有遥感基础模型主要针对光学图像预训练，缺乏多光谱/高光谱数据的对应模型，限制了其在地球观测中的潜力。

Method: 提出SpectralX框架，包含两阶段训练：第一阶段通过掩码重建任务和Hyper Tokenizer提取空间与光谱属性；第二阶段引入Attribute-refined Adapter，结合语义分割任务优化模型。

Result: SpectralX能够有效处理多光谱/高光谱数据，并适应新区域或季节的图像。

Conclusion: SpectralX为遥感基础模型在多光谱/高光谱数据上的应用提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Remote Sensing Foundation Models (RSFMs) have led to
significant breakthroughs in the field. While many RSFMs have been pretrained
with massive optical imagery, more multispectral/hyperspectral data remain lack
of the corresponding foundation models. To leverage the advantages of spectral
imagery in earth observation, we explore whether existing RSFMs can be
effectively adapted to process diverse spectral modalities without requiring
extensive spectral pretraining. In response to this challenge, we proposed
SpectralX, an innovative parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework that adapt
existing RSFMs as backbone while introducing a two-stage training approach to
handle various spectral inputs, thereby significantly improving domain
generalization performance. In the first stage, we employ a
masked-reconstruction task and design a specialized Hyper Tokenizer (HyperT) to
extract attribute tokens from both spatial and spectral dimensions.
Simultaneously, we develop an Attribute-oriented Mixture of Adapter (AoMoA)
that dynamically aggregates multi-attribute expert knowledge while performing
layer-wise fine-tuning. With semantic segmentation as downstream task in the
second stage, we insert an Attribute-refined Adapter (Are-adapter) into the
first stage framework. By iteratively querying low-level semantic features with
high-level representations, the model learns to focus on task-beneficial
attributes, enabling customized adjustment of RSFMs. Following this two-phase
adaptation process, SpectralX is capable of interpreting spectral imagery from
new regions or seasons. The codes will be available from the website:

Motivation: 现有方法将语义特征附加到自由高斯集合中并通过可微分渲染提取特征，导致分割噪声和高斯选择混乱，需要更高效的语义感知3D高斯表示。

Method: 提出AG$^2$aussian框架，利用锚图结构组织语义特征并规范高斯基元，实现紧凑且实例感知的高斯分布和基于图的传播。

Result: 在四种应用（交互式点击查询、开放词汇文本驱动查询、对象移除编辑和物理模拟）中验证了方法的优势，实验和消融研究证明了关键设计的有效性。

Conclusion: AG$^2$aussian通过锚图结构显著提升了3D高斯溅射的语义感知能力，为场景理解和编辑任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has witnessed exponential adoption across
diverse applications, driving a critical need for semantic-aware 3D Gaussian
representations to enable scene understanding and editing tasks. Existing
approaches typically attach semantic features to a collection of free Gaussians
and distill the features via differentiable rendering, leading to noisy
segmentation and a messy selection of Gaussians. In this paper, we introduce
AG$^2$aussian, a novel framework that leverages an anchor-graph structure to
organize semantic features and regulate Gaussian primitives. Our anchor-graph
structure not only promotes compact and instance-aware Gaussian distributions,
but also facilitates graph-based propagation, achieving a clean and accurate
instance-level Gaussian selection. Extensive validation across four
applications, i.e. interactive click-based query, open-vocabulary text-driven
query, object removal editing, and physics simulation, demonstrates the
advantages of our approach and its benefits to various applications. The
experiments and ablation studies further evaluate the effectiveness of the key
designs of our approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SEA的新型灰盒越狱攻击方法，通过模拟微调轨迹和针对性提示引导，成功攻击了微调后的视觉语言模型，揭示了开源基础模型中的漏洞可能被继承的风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是揭示开源视觉语言模型（VLMs）微调后可能保留的漏洞，使其易受可转移的越狱攻击，从而呼吁对微调后的专有VLMs进行更全面的保护。

Method: 方法包括模拟微调轨迹（FTS）和针对性提示引导（TPG），前者模拟视觉编码器的参数变化生成对抗性图像，后者通过文本策略引导语言解码器输出对抗性结果。

Result: 实验结果表明，SEA在Qwen2-VL家族（2B和7B）上的攻击成功率超过86.5%，毒性率接近49.5%，显著提升了攻击的可转移性。

Conclusion: 结论强调了保护微调后的专有VLMs免受开源基础模型漏洞影响的紧迫性，并呼吁在整个模型生命周期中开发全面的防御措施。

Abstract: Fine-tuning open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs) creates a critical yet
underexplored attack surface: vulnerabilities in the base VLM could be retained
in fine-tuned variants, rendering them susceptible to transferable jailbreak
attacks. To demonstrate this risk, we introduce the Simulated Ensemble Attack
(SEA), a novel grey-box jailbreak method in which the adversary has full access
to the base VLM but no knowledge of the fine-tuned target's weights or training
configuration. To improve jailbreak transferability across fine-tuned VLMs, SEA
combines two key techniques: Fine-tuning Trajectory Simulation (FTS) and
Targeted Prompt Guidance (TPG). FTS generates transferable adversarial images
by simulating the vision encoder's parameter shifts, while TPG is a textual
strategy that steers the language decoder toward adversarially optimized
outputs. Experiments on the Qwen2-VL family (2B and 7B) demonstrate that SEA
achieves high transfer attack success rates exceeding 86.5% and toxicity rates
near 49.5% across diverse fine-tuned variants, even those specifically
fine-tuned to improve safety behaviors. Notably, while direct PGD-based image
jailbreaks rarely transfer across fine-tuned VLMs, SEA reliably exploits
inherited vulnerabilities from the base model, significantly enhancing
transferability. These findings highlight an urgent need to safeguard
fine-tuned proprietary VLMs against transferable vulnerabilities inherited from
open-source foundations, motivating the development of holistic defenses across
the entire model lifecycle.

Motivation: 解决现有方法在手-物交互细节利用不足、动词-名词语义依赖忽略及缺乏显式认知推理的问题。

Method: 两阶段框架：1) 提取手-物交互特征并利用动词-名词共现矩阵；2) 引入强化学习模块模拟认知推理（感知-推理-预测）。

Conclusion: INSIGHT通过结合细粒度视觉特征和显式认知推理，显著提升了长期动作预测的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Long-term action anticipation from egocentric video is critical for
applications such as human-computer interaction and assistive technologies,
where anticipating user intent enables proactive and context-aware AI
assistance. However, existing approaches suffer from three key limitations: 1)
underutilization of fine-grained visual cues from hand-object interactions, 2)
neglect of semantic dependencies between verbs and nouns, and 3) lack of
explicit cognitive reasoning, limiting generalization and long-term forecasting
ability. To overcome these challenges, we propose INSIGHT, a unified two-stage
framework for egocentric action anticipation. In the first stage, INSIGHT
focuses on extracting semantically rich features from hand-object interaction
regions and enhances action representations using a verb-noun co-occurrence
matrix. In the second stage, it introduces a reinforcement learning-based
module that simulates explicit cognitive reasoning through a structured
process: visual perception (think) -> intention inference (reason) -> action
anticipation (answer). Extensive experiments on Ego4D, EPIC-Kitchens-55, and
EGTEA Gaze+ benchmarks show that INSIGHT achieves state-of-the-art performance,
demonstrating its effectiveness and strong generalization capability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前差分隐私数据集蒸馏方法中采样-优化同步和噪声训练信号依赖的问题，以提高隐私信息利用效率。

Method: 引入新框架，解耦采样与优化，通过在信息子空间匹配减少差分隐私噪声影响。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上，每类50张图像时性能提升10.0%，蒸馏集大小仅为先前方法的五分之一时提升8.3%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著推进了隐私保护数据集蒸馏的发展。

Abstract: Modern machine learning models heavily rely on large datasets that often
include sensitive and private information, raising serious privacy concerns.
Differentially private (DP) data generation offers a solution by creating
synthetic datasets that limit the leakage of private information within a
predefined privacy budget; however, it requires a substantial amount of data to
achieve performance comparable to models trained on the original data. To
mitigate the significant expense incurred with synthetic data generation,
Dataset Distillation (DD) stands out for its remarkable training and storage
efficiency. This efficiency is particularly advantageous when integrated with
DP mechanisms, curating compact yet informative synthetic datasets without
compromising privacy. However, current state-of-the-art private DD methods
suffer from a synchronized sampling-optimization process and the dependency on
noisy training signals from randomly initialized networks. This results in the
inefficient utilization of private information due to the addition of excessive
noise. To address these issues, we introduce a novel framework that decouples
sampling from optimization for better convergence and improves signal quality
by mitigating the impact of DP noise through matching in an informative
subspace. On CIFAR-10, our method achieves a \textbf{10.0\%} improvement with
50 images per class and \textbf{8.3\%} increase with just \textbf{one-fifth}
the distilled set size of previous state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating
significant potential to advance privacy-preserving DD.

Motivation: 奶牛活动和行为与健康及福利相关，但人工监测费时且不一致，需自动化解决方案。

Method: 使用多摄像头系统，结合YOLO11-m和SAMURAI模型进行检测与分割，利用卡尔曼滤波和数据关联实现追踪。

Result: 系统性能优异，MOTA达98.7%和99.3%，IDF1分数超99%，身份切换接近零。

Conclusion: 该系统能实时追踪复杂环境中的奶牛，减少冗余检测，有望通过行为分类提升疾病预测能力。

Abstract: Activity and behaviour correlate with dairy cow health and welfare, making
continual and accurate monitoring crucial for disease identification and farm
productivity. Manual observation and frequent assessments are laborious and
inconsistent for activity monitoring. In this study, we developed a unique
multi-camera, real-time tracking system for indoor-housed Holstein Friesian
dairy cows. This technology uses cutting-edge computer vision techniques,
including instance segmentation and tracking algorithms to monitor cow activity
seamlessly and accurately. An integrated top-down barn panorama was created by
geometrically aligning six camera feeds using homographic transformations. The
detection phase used a refined YOLO11-m model trained on an overhead cow
dataset, obtaining high accuracy (mAP\@0.50 = 0.97, F1 = 0.95). SAMURAI, an
upgraded Segment Anything Model 2.1, generated pixel-precise cow masks for
instance segmentation utilizing zero-shot learning and motion-aware memory.
Even with occlusion and fluctuating posture, a motion-aware Linear Kalman
filter and IoU-based data association reliably identified cows over time for
object tracking. The proposed system significantly outperformed Deep SORT
Realtime. Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) was 98.7% and 99.3% in two
benchmark video sequences, with IDF1 scores above 99% and near-zero identity
switches. This unified multi-camera system can track dairy cows in complex
interior surroundings in real time, according to our data. The system reduces
redundant detections across overlapping cameras, maintains continuity as cows
move between viewpoints, with the aim of improving early sickness prediction
through activity quantification and behavioural classification.

Conclusion: VPN通过视觉提示提供更直观的导航指导，减少语言模糊性，适合非专业用户，并通过数据增强提升了导航性能。

Abstract: While natural language is commonly used to guide embodied agents, the
inherent ambiguity and verbosity of language often hinder the effectiveness of
language-guided navigation in complex environments. To this end, we propose
Visual Prompt Navigation (VPN), a novel paradigm that guides agents to navigate
using only user-provided visual prompts within 2D top-view maps. This visual
prompt primarily focuses on marking the visual navigation trajectory on a
top-down view of a scene, offering intuitive and spatially grounded guidance
without relying on language instructions. It is more friendly for non-expert
users and reduces interpretive ambiguity. We build VPN tasks in both discrete
and continuous navigation settings, constructing two new datasets, R2R-VP and
R2R-CE-VP, by extending existing R2R and R2R-CE episodes with corresponding
visual prompts. Furthermore, we introduce VPNet, a dedicated baseline network
to handle the VPN tasks, with two data augmentation strategies: view-level
augmentation (altering initial headings and prompt orientations) and
trajectory-level augmentation (incorporating diverse trajectories from
large-scale 3D scenes), to enhance navigation performance. Extensive
experiments evaluate how visual prompt forms, top-view map formats, and data
augmentation strategies affect the performance of visual prompt navigation. The
code is available at https://github.com/farlit/VPN.

Abstract: Autonomous driving requires accurate scene understanding, including road
geometry, traffic agents, and their semantic relationships. In online HD map
generation scenarios, raster-based representations are well-suited to vision
models but lack geometric precision, while graph-based representations retain
structural detail but become unstable without precise maps. To harness the
complementary strengths of both, we propose DiffSemanticFusion -- a fusion
framework for multimodal trajectory prediction and planning. Our approach
reasons over a semantic raster-fused BEV space, enhanced by a map diffusion
module that improves both the stability and expressiveness of online HD map
representations. We validate our framework on two downstream tasks: trajectory
prediction and planning-oriented end-to-end autonomous driving. Experiments on
real-world autonomous driving benchmarks, nuScenes and NAVSIM, demonstrate
improved performance over several state-of-the-art methods. For the prediction
task on nuScenes, we integrate DiffSemanticFusion with the online HD map
informed QCNet, achieving a 5.1\% performance improvement. For end-to-end
autonomous driving in NAVSIM, DiffSemanticFusion achieves state-of-the-art
results, with a 15\% performance gain in NavHard scenarios. In addition,
extensive ablation and sensitivity studies show that our map diffusion module
can be seamlessly integrated into other vector-based approaches to enhance
performance. All artifacts are available at

Conclusion: 该方法无需显式先验知识，通过图推理模块提升了分割性能，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The preoperative planning of liver surgery relies on Couinaud segmentation
from computed tomography (CT) images, to reduce the risk of bleeding and guide
the resection procedure. Using 3D point-based representations, rather than
voxelizing the CT volume, has the benefit of preserving the physical resolution
of the CT. However, point-based representations need prior knowledge of the
liver vessel structure, which is time consuming to acquire. Here, we propose a
point-based method for Couinaud segmentation, without explicitly providing the
prior liver vessel structure. To allow the model to learn this anatomical liver
vessel structure, we add a graph reasoning module on top of the point features.
This adds implicit anatomical information to the model, by learning affinities
across point neighborhoods. Our method is competitive on the MSD and LiTS
public datasets in Dice coefficient and average surface distance scores
compared to four pioneering point-based methods. Our code is available at
https://github.com/ZhangXiaotong015/GrPn.

Abstract: The field of Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR) poses substantial
technical challenges, including fluid inter-sign transitions, the absence of
temporal boundaries, and co-articulation effects. This paper, developed for the
MSLR 2025 Workshop Challenge at ICCV 2025, addresses the critical challenge of
signer-independent recognition to advance the generalization capabilities of
CSLR systems across diverse signers. A data-centric methodology is proposed,
centered on systematic feature engineering, a robust preprocessing pipeline,
and an optimized model architecture. Key contributions include a principled
feature selection process guided by Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to isolate
communicative keypoints, a rigorous preprocessing pipeline incorporating
DBSCAN-based outlier filtering and spatial normalization, and the novel
CSLRConformer architecture. This architecture adapts the hybrid CNN-Transformer
design of the Conformer model, leveraging its capacity to model local temporal
dependencies and global sequence context; a characteristic uniquely suited for
the spatio-temporal dynamics of sign language. The proposed methodology
achieved a competitive performance, with a Word Error Rate (WER) of 5.60% on
the development set and 12.01% on the test set, a result that secured a 3rd
place ranking on the official competition platform. This research validates the
efficacy of cross-domain architectural adaptation, demonstrating that the
Conformer model, originally conceived for speech recognition, can be
successfully repurposed to establish a new state-of-the-art performance in
keypoint-based CSLR.

Result: 在现有基准测试中达到SOTA性能，显著提升了多种逐帧重建方法的准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过物理增强的扩散模型有效提升了3D手部运动重建的精度和时序一致性，尤其在复杂交互场景中表现优异。

Abstract: While 3D hand reconstruction from monocular images has made significant
progress, generating accurate and temporally coherent motion estimates from
videos remains challenging, particularly during hand-object interactions. In
this paper, we present a novel 3D hand motion recovery framework that enhances
image-based reconstructions through a diffusion-based and physics-augmented
motion refinement model. Our model captures the distribution of refined motion
estimates conditioned on initial ones, generating improved sequences through an
iterative denoising process. Instead of relying on scarce annotated video data,
we train our model only using motion capture data without images. We identify
valuable intuitive physics knowledge during hand-object interactions, including
key motion states and their associated motion constraints. We effectively
integrate these physical insights into our diffusion model to improve its
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly
improves various frame-wise reconstruction methods, achieving state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance on existing benchmarks.

Abstract: This paper presents a simple algebraic method to estimate the pose of a
camera relative to a planar target from $n \geq 4$ reference points with known
coordinates in the target frame and their corresponding bearing measurements in
the camera frame. The proposed approach follows a hierarchical structure;
first, the unit vector normal to the target plane is determined, followed by
the camera's position vector, its distance to the target plane, and finally,
the full orientation. To improve the method's robustness to measurement noise,
an averaging methodology is introduced to refine the estimation of the target's
normal direction. The accuracy and robustness of the approach are validated
through extensive experiments.

TL;DR: OmniEvent是一个统一的事件表示学习框架，通过解耦-增强-融合范式解决事件数据的时空不均匀性问题，无需任务特定设计，在多个任务中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机数据因其非结构化分布和时空不均匀性，通常需要任务特定设计，限制了现有架构的复用性。

Method: 提出解耦-增强-融合范式，独立处理时空域特征，使用空间填充曲线优化计算效率，并通过注意力机制融合特征。

Result: 在3个代表性任务和10个数据集中，OmniEvent比任务特定方法性能提升高达68.2%。

Conclusion: OmniEvent首次实现了事件数据的统一表示学习，为事件相机应用提供了通用解决方案。

Abstract: Event cameras have gained increasing popularity in computer vision due to
their ultra-high dynamic range and temporal resolution. However, event networks
heavily rely on task-specific designs due to the unstructured data distribution
and spatial-temporal (S-T) inhomogeneity, making it hard to reuse existing
architectures for new tasks. We propose OmniEvent, the first unified event
representation learning framework that achieves SOTA performance across diverse
tasks, fully removing the need of task-specific designs. Unlike previous
methods that treat event data as 3D point clouds with manually tuned S-T
scaling weights, OmniEvent proposes a decouple-enhance-fuse paradigm, where the
local feature aggregation and enhancement is done independently on the spatial
and temporal domains to avoid inhomogeneity issues. Space-filling curves are
applied to enable large receptive fields while improving memory and compute
efficiency. The features from individual domains are then fused by attention to
learn S-T interactions. The output of OmniEvent is a grid-shaped tensor, which
enables standard vision models to process event data without architecture
change. With a unified framework and similar hyper-parameters, OmniEvent
out-performs (tasks-specific) SOTA by up to 68.2% across 3 representative tasks
and 10 datasets (Fig.1). Code will be ready in

Abstract: Adversarial attacks against computer vision systems have emerged as a
critical research area that challenges the fundamental assumptions about neural
network robustness and security. This comprehensive survey examines the
evolving landscape of adversarial techniques, revealing their dual nature as
both sophisticated security threats and valuable defensive tools. We provide a
systematic analysis of adversarial attack methodologies across three primary
domains: pixel-space attacks, physically realizable attacks, and latent-space
attacks. Our investigation traces the technical evolution from early
gradient-based methods such as FGSM and PGD to sophisticated optimization
techniques incorporating momentum, adaptive step sizes, and advanced
transferability mechanisms. We examine how physically realizable attacks have
successfully bridged the gap between digital vulnerabilities and real-world
threats through adversarial patches, 3D textures, and dynamic optical
perturbations. Additionally, we explore the emergence of latent-space attacks
that leverage semantic structure in internal representations to create more
transferable and meaningful adversarial examples. Beyond traditional offensive
applications, we investigate the constructive use of adversarial techniques for
vulnerability assessment in biometric authentication systems and protection
against malicious generative models. Our analysis reveals critical research
gaps, particularly in neural style transfer protection and computational
efficiency requirements. This survey contributes a comprehensive taxonomy,
evolution analysis, and identification of future research directions, aiming to
advance understanding of adversarial vulnerabilities and inform the development
of more robust and trustworthy computer vision systems.

*Junlong Tong,Wei Zhang,Yaohui Jin,Xiaoyu Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于上下文引导变换器（CGT）的熵模型，通过重新采样时间上下文和依赖加权的空间上下文来估计当前帧的概率质量函数，显著降低了计算成本和熵建模时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有条件熵模型在利用时空上下文时存在模型复杂性和计算成本高的问题，且空间上下文模型缺乏对依赖顺序的显式建模。

Method: 设计了时间上下文重采样器和依赖加权的空间上下文分配器（教师-学生网络），以减少计算开销并显式建模空间依赖顺序。

Result: CGT模型将熵建模时间减少约65%，BD-Rate降低11%。

Conclusion: CGT模型通过优化时空上下文建模，显著提升了效率和性能。

Abstract: Conditional entropy models effectively leverage spatio-temporal contexts to
reduce video redundancy. However, incorporating temporal context often
introduces additional model complexity and increases computational cost. In
parallel, many existing spatial context models lack explicit modeling the
ordering of spatial dependencies, which may limit the availability of relevant
context during decoding. To address these issues, we propose the Context Guided
Transformer (CGT) entropy model, which estimates probability mass functions of
the current frame conditioned on resampled temporal context and
dependency-weighted spatial context. A temporal context resampler learns
predefined latent queries to extract critical temporal information using
transformer encoders, reducing downstream computational overhead. Meanwhile, a
teacher-student network is designed as dependency-weighted spatial context
assigner to explicitly model the dependency of spatial context order. The
teacher generates an attention map to represent token importance and an entropy
map to reflect prediction certainty from randomly masked inputs, guiding the
student to select the weighted top-k tokens with the highest spatial
dependency. During inference, only the student is used to predict undecoded
tokens based on high-dependency context. Experimental results demonstrate that
our CGT model reduces entropy modeling time by approximately 65% and achieves
an 11% BD-Rate reduction compared to the previous state-of-the-art conditional
entropy model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在抽象场景和固定搜索路径下进行，缺乏对现实场景的适用性，本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用36名参与者的用户研究，使用140个现实场景，结合眼动和脑电图特征进行分类。

Result: 新方法在跨用户评估中达到83.6%的准确率，显著优于之前基于扫视相关电位的方法（56.9%）。

Conclusion: 该方法在现实场景中显著提升了目标与非目标注视点的区分能力，为辅助系统提供了更可靠的基础。

Abstract: Distinguishing target from non-target fixations during visual search is a
fundamental building block to understand users' intended actions and to build
effective assistance systems. While prior research indicated the feasibility of
classifying target vs. non-target fixations based on eye tracking and
electroencephalography (EEG) data, these studies were conducted with explicitly
instructed search trajectories, abstract visual stimuli, and disregarded any
scene context. This is in stark contrast with the fact that human visual search
is largely driven by scene characteristics and raises questions regarding
generalizability to more realistic scenarios. To close this gap, we, for the
first time, investigate the classification of target vs. non-target fixations
during free visual search in realistic scenes. In particular, we conducted a
36-participants user study using a large variety of 140 realistic visual search
scenes in two highly relevant application scenarios: searching for icons on
desktop backgrounds and finding tools in a cluttered workshop. Our approach
based on gaze and EEG features outperforms the previous state-of-the-art
approach based on a combination of fixation duration and saccade-related
potentials. We perform extensive evaluations to assess the generalizability of
our approach across scene types. Our approach significantly advances the
ability to distinguish between target and non-target fixations in realistic
scenarios, achieving 83.6% accuracy in cross-user evaluations. This
substantially outperforms previous methods based on saccade-related potentials,
which reached only 56.9% accuracy.

Conclusion: DiffusionFF在检测精度和定位能力上均表现出色，验证了其整体有效性。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of deepfake generation techniques demands robust and
accurate face forgery detection algorithms. While determining whether an image
has been manipulated remains essential, the ability to precisely localize
forgery artifacts has become increasingly important for improving model
explainability and fostering user trust. To address this challenge, we propose
DiffusionFF, a novel framework that enhances face forgery detection through
diffusion-based artifact localization. Our method utilizes a denoising
diffusion model to generate high-quality Structural Dissimilarity (DSSIM) maps,
which effectively capture subtle traces of manipulation. These DSSIM maps are
then fused with high-level semantic features extracted by a pretrained forgery
detector, leading to significant improvements in detection accuracy. Extensive
experiments on both cross-dataset and intra-dataset benchmarks demonstrate that
DiffusionFF not only achieves superior detection performance but also offers
precise and fine-grained artifact localization, highlighting its overall
effectiveness.

Result: 在流式和长视频理解任务中，该方法在响应准确性和实时效率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: StreamAgent在实时视频流场景中具有实用价值，能够提升主动决策和响应能力。

Abstract: Real-time streaming video understanding in domains such as autonomous driving
and intelligent surveillance poses challenges beyond conventional offline video
processing, requiring continuous perception, proactive decision making, and
responsive interaction based on dynamically evolving visual content. However,
existing methods rely on alternating perception-reaction or asynchronous
triggers, lacking task-driven planning and future anticipation, which limits
their real-time responsiveness and proactive decision making in evolving video
streams. To this end, we propose a StreamAgent that anticipates the temporal
intervals and spatial regions expected to contain future task-relevant
information to enable proactive and goal-driven responses. Specifically, we
integrate question semantics and historical observations through prompting the
anticipatory agent to anticipate the temporal progression of key events, align
current observations with the expected future evidence, and subsequently adjust
the perception action (e.g., attending to task-relevant regions or continuously
tracking in subsequent frames). To enable efficient inference, we design a
streaming KV-cache memory mechanism that constructs a hierarchical memory
structure for selective recall of relevant tokens, enabling efficient semantic
retrieval while reducing the overhead of storing all tokens in the traditional
KV-cache. Extensive experiments on streaming and long video understanding tasks
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in response accuracy
and real-time efficiency, highlighting its practical value for real-world
streaming scenarios.

Motivation: 医学影像研究需要大规模数据共享，但患者隐私保护是一个重要挑战。现有的去标识化工具缺乏客观评估方法，限制了其可靠性和可重复性。

Method: 开发了一个包含合成PHI/PII的公开DICOM数据集（MIDI），并提供了一个评估框架，包括Python脚本、答案键和映射文件，用于自动化比较去标识化效果。

Abstract: Medical imaging research increasingly depends on large-scale data sharing to
promote reproducibility and train Artificial Intelligence (AI) models. Ensuring
patient privacy remains a significant challenge for open-access data sharing.
Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM), the global standard
data format for medical imaging, encodes both essential clinical metadata and
extensive protected health information (PHI) and personally identifiable
information (PII). Effective de-identification must remove identifiers,
preserve scientific utility, and maintain DICOM validity. Tools exist to
perform de-identification, but few assess its effectiveness, and most rely on
subjective reviews, limiting reproducibility and regulatory confidence. To
address this gap, we developed an openly accessible DICOM dataset infused with
synthetic PHI/PII and an evaluation framework for benchmarking image
de-identification workflows. The Medical Image de-identification (MIDI) dataset
was built using publicly available de-identified data from The Cancer Imaging
Archive (TCIA). It includes 538 subjects (216 for validation, 322 for testing),
605 studies, 708 series, and 53,581 DICOM image instances. These span multiple
vendors, imaging modalities, and cancer types. Synthetic PHI and PII were
embedded into structured data elements, plain text data elements, and pixel
data to simulate real-world identity leaks encountered by TCIA curation teams.
Accompanying evaluation tools include a Python script, answer keys (known
truth), and mapping files that enable automated comparison of curated data
against expected transformations. The framework is aligned with the HIPAA
Privacy Rule "Safe Harbor" method, DICOM PS3.15 Confidentiality Profiles, and
TCIA best practices. It supports objective, standards-driven evaluation of
de-identification workflows, promoting safer and more consistent medical image
sharing.

Motivation: 解决全天智能眼镜在连续感知中的能源效率问题，以实现人类记忆增强。

Result: EgoTrigger平均减少54%的帧数，显著节省能源，同时在记忆任务中表现相当。

Conclusion: 上下文感知触发策略为全天候节能智能眼镜提供了可行方向。

Abstract: All-day smart glasses are likely to emerge as platforms capable of continuous
contextual sensing, uniquely positioning them for unprecedented assistance in
our daily lives. Integrating the multi-modal AI agents required for human
memory enhancement while performing continuous sensing, however, presents a
major energy efficiency challenge for all-day usage. Achieving this balance
requires intelligent, context-aware sensor management. Our approach,
EgoTrigger, leverages audio cues from the microphone to selectively activate
power-intensive cameras, enabling efficient sensing while preserving
substantial utility for human memory enhancement. EgoTrigger uses a lightweight
audio model (YAMNet) and a custom classification head to trigger image capture
from hand-object interaction (HOI) audio cues, such as the sound of a drawer
opening or a medication bottle being opened. In addition to evaluating on the
QA-Ego4D dataset, we introduce and evaluate on the Human Memory Enhancement
Question-Answer (HME-QA) dataset. Our dataset contains 340 human-annotated
first-person QA pairs from full-length Ego4D videos that were curated to ensure
that they contained audio, focusing on HOI moments critical for contextual
understanding and memory. Our results show EgoTrigger can use 54% fewer frames
on average, significantly saving energy in both power-hungry sensing components
(e.g., cameras) and downstream operations (e.g., wireless transmission), while
achieving comparable performance on datasets for an episodic memory task. We
believe this context-aware triggering strategy represents a promising direction
for enabling energy-efficient, functional smart glasses capable of all-day use
-- supporting applications like helping users recall where they placed their
keys or information about their routine activities (e.g., taking medications).

Motivation: 研究统一视觉语言模型（VLM）在工业检测中的可行性，以简化多任务视觉流程。

Method: 使用InspectVLM（基于Florence-2）和InspectMM数据集进行评估。

Result: InspectVLM在分类和关键点任务中表现尚可，但在核心检测指标上不及ResNet，且对提示变化敏感，输出不稳定。

Conclusion: 当前VLM在视觉基础和鲁棒性上不足，不适合高精度工业检测。

Abstract: Unified vision-language models (VLMs) promise to streamline computer vision
pipelines by reframing multiple visual tasks such as classification, detection,
and keypoint localization within a single language-driven interface. This
architecture is particularly appealing in industrial inspection, where managing
disjoint task-specific models introduces complexity, inefficiency, and
maintenance overhead. In this paper, we critically evaluate the viability of
this unified paradigm using InspectVLM, a Florence-2-based VLM trained on
InspectMM, our new large-scale multimodal, multitask inspection dataset. While
InspectVLM performs competitively on image-level classification and structured
keypoint tasks, we find that it fails to match traditional ResNet-based models
in core inspection metrics. Notably, the model exhibits brittle behavior under
low prompt variability, produces degenerate outputs for fine-grained object
detection, and frequently defaults to memorized language responses regardless
of visual input. Our findings suggest that while language-driven unification
offers conceptual elegance, current VLMs lack the visual grounding and
robustness necessary for deployment in precision critical industrial
inspections.

Abstract: Instance segmentation is critical in biomedical imaging to accurately
distinguish individual objects like cells, which often overlap and vary in
size. Recent query-based methods, where object queries guide segmentation, have
shown strong performance. While U-Net has been a go-to architecture in medical
image segmentation, its potential in query-based approaches remains largely
unexplored. In this work, we present IAUNet, a novel query-based U-Net
architecture. The core design features a full U-Net architecture, enhanced by a
novel lightweight convolutional Pixel decoder, making the model more efficient
and reducing the number of parameters. Additionally, we propose a Transformer
decoder that refines object-specific features across multiple scales. Finally,
we introduce the 2025 Revvity Full Cell Segmentation Dataset, a unique resource
with detailed annotations of overlapping cell cytoplasm in brightfield images,
setting a new benchmark for biomedical instance segmentation. Experiments on
multiple public datasets and our own show that IAUNet outperforms most
state-of-the-art fully convolutional, transformer-based, and query-based models
and cell segmentation-specific models, setting a strong baseline for cell
instance segmentation tasks. Code is available at

Result: 在CIFAR-10和GTSRB上的实验表明，DBOM能有效检测中毒图像，提升训练管道的安全性。

Conclusion: DBOM为零样本泛化到未见触发器-对象配对提供了新方法，为对抗攻击模式提供了更深入的理解。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) and generative AI (GenAI) are increasingly
vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where adversaries embed triggers into inputs to
cause models to misclassify or misinterpret target labels. Beyond traditional
single-trigger scenarios, attackers may inject multiple triggers across various
object classes, forming unseen backdoor-object configurations that evade
standard detection pipelines. In this paper, we introduce DBOM (Disentangled
Backdoor-Object Modeling), a proactive framework that leverages structured
disentanglement to identify and neutralize both seen and unseen backdoor
threats at the dataset level. Specifically, DBOM factorizes input image
representations by modeling triggers and objects as independent primitives in
the embedding space through the use of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By
leveraging the frozen, pre-trained encoders of VLMs, our approach decomposes
the latent representations into distinct components through a learnable visual
prompt repository and prompt prefix tuning, ensuring that the relationships
between triggers and objects are explicitly captured. To separate trigger and
object representations in the visual prompt repository, we introduce the
trigger-object separation and diversity losses that aids in disentangling
trigger and object visual features. Next, by aligning image features with
feature decomposition and fusion, as well as learned contextual prompt tokens
in a shared multimodal space, DBOM enables zero-shot generalization to novel
trigger-object pairings that were unseen during training, thereby offering
deeper insights into adversarial attack patterns. Experimental results on
CIFAR-10 and GTSRB demonstrate that DBOM robustly detects poisoned images prior
to downstream training, significantly enhancing the security of DNN training
pipelines.

proposed framework has been validated through extensive comparative analyses on
these datasets, demonstrating that our system achieves superior performance in

effective pipeline that adapts YOLO's convolutional backbones as encoders,
employs global pooling and projection heads, and optimizes a contrastive loss
using augmentations of the COCO unlabeled dataset (120k images). The pretrained
backbones are then fine-tuned on a cyclist detection task with limited labeled
data. Experimental results show that SSL pretraining leads to consistently
higher mAP, faster convergence, and improved precision-recall performance,
especially in low-label regimes. For example, our SimCLR-pretrained YOLOv8
achieves a mAP@50:95 of 0.7663, outperforming its supervised counterpart
despite using no annotations during pretraining. These findings establish a
strong baseline for applying contrastive SSL to one-stage detectors and
highlight the potential of unlabeled data as a scalable resource for
label-efficient object detection.

*Xiaoyu Zhang,Ziwei Wang,Hai Dong,Zhifeng Bao,Jiajun Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种点云降采样框架，通过保留关键物体信息并过滤无关背景点，解决了自动驾驶车辆数据存储和处理的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆生成的点云数据量大，存储、带宽和处理成本高，需高效降采样方法。

Method: 分两步：1) 物体存在检测（无监督密度峰值分类器和有监督朴素贝叶斯分类器）；2) 采样预算分配策略。

Result: 在KITTI和nuScenes数据集上表现优于现有方法，效率和效果均优。

Conclusion: 该方法模型无关，可无缝集成到下游模型，是自动驾驶点云降采样的高效解决方案。

Abstract: Point clouds are essential for object modeling and play a critical role in
assisting driving tasks for autonomous vehicles (AVs). However, the significant
volume of data generated by AVs creates challenges for storage, bandwidth, and
processing cost. To tackle these challenges, we propose a representative point
selection framework for point cloud downsampling, which preserves critical
object-related information while effectively filtering out irrelevant
background points. Our method involves two steps: (1) Object Presence
Detection, where we introduce an unsupervised density peak-based classifier and
a supervised Na\"ive Bayes classifier to handle diverse scenarios, and (2)
Sampling Budget Allocation, where we propose a strategy that selects
object-relevant points while maintaining a high retention rate of object
information. Extensive experiments on the KITTI and nuScenes datasets
demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines
in both efficiency and effectiveness across varying sampling rates. As a
model-agnostic solution, our approach integrates seamlessly with diverse
downstream models, making it a valuable and scalable addition to the 3D point
cloud downsampling toolkit for AV applications.

Result: 在Babel-QA和新构建的HuMMan数据集上达到最优性能，展示了跨数据集的适应性。

Conclusion: IMoRe框架通过隐式程序引导实现了高效且适应性强的运动推理。

Abstract: Existing human motion Q\&A methods rely on explicit program execution, where
the requirement for manually defined functional modules may limit the
scalability and adaptability. To overcome this, we propose an implicit
program-guided motion reasoning (IMoRe) framework that unifies reasoning across
multiple query types without manually designed modules. Unlike existing
implicit reasoning approaches that infer reasoning operations from question
words, our model directly conditions on structured program functions, ensuring
a more precise execution of reasoning steps. Additionally, we introduce a
program-guided reading mechanism, which dynamically selects multi-level motion
representations from a pretrained motion Vision Transformer (ViT), capturing
both high-level semantics and fine-grained motion cues. The reasoning module
iteratively refines memory representations, leveraging structured program
functions to extract relevant information for different query types. Our model
achieves state-of-the-art performance on Babel-QA and generalizes to a newly
constructed motion Q\&A dataset based on HuMMan, demonstrating its adaptability
across different motion reasoning datasets. Code and dataset are available at:

Abstract: As the application of deep learning in dermatology continues to grow, the
recognition of melanoma has garnered significant attention, demonstrating
potential for improving diagnostic accuracy. Despite advancements in image
classification techniques, existing models still face challenges in identifying
subtle visual cues that differentiate melanoma from benign lesions. This paper
presents a novel Deeply Dual Supervised Learning framework that integrates
local and global feature extraction to enhance melanoma recognition. By
employing a dual-pathway structure, the model focuses on both fine-grained
local features and broader contextual information, ensuring a comprehensive
understanding of the image content. The framework utilizes a dual attention
mechanism that dynamically emphasizes critical features, thereby reducing the
risk of overlooking subtle characteristics of melanoma. Additionally, we
introduce a multi-scale feature aggregation strategy to ensure robust
performance across varying image resolutions. Extensive experiments on
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in melanoma detection, achieving higher accuracy and
better resilience against false positives. This work lays the foundation for
future research in automated skin cancer recognition and highlights the
effectiveness of dual supervised learning in medical image analysis.

Conclusion: 该方法有望实现实时高分辨率非视距成像，并扩展应用平台范围。

Abstract: Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging seeks to reconstruct hidden objects by
analyzing reflections from intermediary surfaces. Existing methods typically
model both the measurement data and the hidden scene in three dimensions,
overlooking the inherently two-dimensional nature of most hidden objects. This
oversight leads to high computational costs and substantial memory consumption,
limiting practical applications and making real-time, high-resolution NLOS
imaging on lightweight devices challenging. In this paper, we introduce a novel
approach that represents the hidden scene using two-dimensional functions and
employs a Quasi-Fresnel transform to establish a direct inversion formula
between the measurement data and the hidden scene. This transformation
leverages the two-dimensional characteristics of the problem to significantly
reduce computational complexity and memory requirements. Our algorithm
efficiently performs fast transformations between these two-dimensional
aggregated data, enabling rapid reconstruction of hidden objects with minimal
memory usage. Compared to existing methods, our approach reduces runtime and
memory demands by several orders of magnitude while maintaining imaging
quality. The substantial reduction in memory usage not only enhances
computational efficiency but also enables NLOS imaging on lightweight devices
such as mobile and embedded systems. We anticipate that this method will
facilitate real-time, high-resolution NLOS imaging and broaden its
applicability across a wider range of platforms.

Motivation: 现有的大规模文本到图像扩散模型难以捕捉复杂细节（如纹理），导致用户意图无法完全体现。虽然已有方法通过修改自注意力机制引入图像提示，但仍存在分类器自由引导中的冲突信号以及生成图像真实性与提示对齐之间的权衡问题。

Method: 提出冲突自由引导（conflict-free guidance），仅将图像提示作为期望条件；并设计分层注意力（Stratified Attention），联合使用生成图像和图像提示的键值，平衡真实性与对齐性。

Result: 在三个图像生成任务上的实验表明，该方法优于现有图像提示模型，能更忠实地反映图像提示。

Conclusion: 通过冲突自由引导和分层注意力，论文有效解决了图像提示生成中的关键问题，提升了生成质量。

Abstract: While large-scale text-to-image diffusion models enable the generation of
high-quality, diverse images from text prompts, these prompts struggle to
capture intricate details, such as textures, preventing the user intent from
being reflected. This limitation has led to efforts to generate images
conditioned on user-provided images, referred to as image prompts. Recent work
modifies the self-attention mechanism to impose image conditions in generated
images by replacing or concatenating the keys and values from the image prompt.
This enables the self-attention layer to work like a cross-attention layer,
generally used to incorporate text prompts. In this paper, we identify two
common issues in existing methods of modifying self-attention to generate
images that reflect the details of image prompts. First, existing approaches
neglect the importance of image prompts in classifier-free guidance.
Specifically, current methods use image prompts as both desired and undesired
conditions in classifier-free guidance, causing conflicting signals. To resolve
this, we propose conflict-free guidance by using image prompts only as desired
conditions, ensuring that the generated image faithfully reflects the image
prompt. In addition, we observe that the two most common self-attention
modifications involve a trade-off between the realism of the generated image
and alignment with the image prompt. Specifically, selecting more keys and
values from the image prompt improves alignment, while selecting more from the
generated image enhances realism. To balance both, we propose an new
self-attention modification method, Stratified Attention to jointly use keys
and values from both images rather than selecting between them. Through
extensive experiments across three image generation tasks, we show that the
proposed method outperforms existing image-prompting models in faithfully
reflecting the image prompt.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLM在自动驾驶中的评估主要基于静态输入的开放环境，缺乏对交互行为和真实安全性的闭环评估。

Method: 设计了双系统适应架构，将高级驾驶命令转化为模拟环境中的控制动作，并通过物理控制抽象层实现真实车辆测试。

Result: 实验表明，现有ADVLMs在闭环条件下的性能仍有局限。

Conclusion: Bench2ADVLM为ADVLMs提供了全面的闭环评估框架，揭示了其在实际应用中的不足。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently emerged as a promising paradigm
in autonomous driving (AD). However, current performance evaluation protocols
for VLM-based AD systems (ADVLMs) are predominantly confined to open-loop
settings with static inputs, neglecting the more realistic and informative
closed-loop setting that captures interactive behavior, feedback resilience,
and real-world safety. To address this, we introduce Bench2ADVLM, a unified
hierarchical closed-loop evaluation framework for real-time, interactive
assessment of ADVLMs across both simulation and physical platforms. Inspired by
dual-process theories of cognition, we first adapt diverse ADVLMs to simulation
environments via a dual-system adaptation architecture. In this design,
heterogeneous high-level driving commands generated by target ADVLMs (fast
system) are interpreted by a general-purpose VLM (slow system) into
standardized mid-level control actions suitable for execution in simulation. To
bridge the gap between simulation and reality, we design a physical control
abstraction layer that translates these mid-level actions into low-level
actuation signals, enabling, for the first time, closed-loop testing of ADVLMs
on physical vehicles. To enable more comprehensive evaluation, Bench2ADVLM
introduces a self-reflective scenario generation module that automatically
explores model behavior and uncovers potential failure modes for
safety-critical scenario generation. Overall, Bench2ADVLM establishes a
hierarchical evaluation pipeline that seamlessly integrates high-level abstract
reasoning, mid-level simulation actions, and low-level real-world execution.
Experiments on diverse scenarios across multiple state-of-the-art ADVLMs and
physical platforms validate the diagnostic strength of our framework, revealing
that existing ADVLMs still exhibit limited performance under closed-loop
conditions.

TL;DR: Protego是一种用户中心的隐私保护方法，通过动态3D面具保护面部图像免受基于检索的隐私侵犯，显著降低检索准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面部识别技术被广泛用于大规模图像检索系统，引发严重隐私问题，如未经同意的身份推断和数字足迹暴露。

Method: Protego将用户的3D面部特征封装为姿态不变的2D表示，并动态变形为自然3D面具，应用于在线分享前。

Result: 实验显示，Protego显著降低黑盒FR模型的检索准确性，性能至少优于现有方法2倍，并提供视觉一致性。

Conclusion: Protego有效对抗面部识别技术的滥用，保护隐私免受大规模监控和未经授权的身份追踪。

Abstract: Face recognition (FR) technologies are increasingly used to power large-scale
image retrieval systems, raising serious privacy concerns. Services like
Clearview AI and PimEyes allow anyone to upload a facial photo and retrieve a
large amount of online content associated with that person. This not only
enables identity inference but also exposes their digital footprint, such as
social media activity, private photos, and news reports, often without their
consent. In response to this emerging threat, we propose Protego, a
user-centric privacy protection method that safeguards facial images from such
retrieval-based privacy intrusions. Protego encapsulates a user's 3D facial
signatures into a pose-invariant 2D representation, which is dynamically
deformed into a natural-looking 3D mask tailored to the pose and expression of
any facial image of the user, and applied prior to online sharing. Motivated by
a critical limitation of existing methods, Protego amplifies the sensitivity of
FR models so that protected images cannot be matched even among themselves.
Experiments show that Protego significantly reduces retrieval accuracy across a
wide range of black-box FR models and performs at least 2x better than existing
methods. It also offers unprecedented visual coherence, particularly in video
settings where consistency and natural appearance are essential. Overall,
Protego contributes to the fight against the misuse of FR for mass surveillance
and unsolicited identity tracing.

Motivation: 解决放疗计划制定中依赖专家经验、现有深度学习方法泛化性和准确性不足的问题。

Method: 采用LightweightVAE3D压缩CT数据，结合多模态输入和渐进噪声去噪框架，使用多头注意力机制和复合损失函数。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，MAE为0.101-0.154，DICE系数0.927，单例计划生成时间降至22秒。

Conclusion: ADDiff-Dose为放疗剂量预测提供了通用高效的解决方案，可显著提升临床工作效率。

Abstract: Radiotherapy treatment planning often relies on time-consuming,
trial-and-error adjustments that heavily depend on the expertise of
specialists, while existing deep learning methods face limitations in
generalization, prediction accuracy, and clinical applicability. To tackle
these challenges, we propose ADDiff-Dose, an Anatomical-Dose Dual Constraints
Conditional Diffusion Model for end-to-end multi-tumor dose prediction. The
model employs LightweightVAE3D to compress high-dimensional CT data and
integrates multimodal inputs, including target and organ-at-risk (OAR) masks
and beam parameters, within a progressive noise addition and denoising
framework. It incorporates conditional features via a multi-head attention
mechanism and utilizes a composite loss function combining MSE, conditional
terms, and KL divergence to ensure both dosimetric accuracy and compliance with
clinical constraints. Evaluation on a large-scale public dataset (2,877 cases)
and three external institutional cohorts (450 cases in total) demonstrates that
ADDiff-Dose significantly outperforms traditional baselines, achieving an MAE
of 0.101-0.154 (compared to 0.316 for UNet and 0.169 for GAN models), a DICE
coefficient of 0.927 (a 6.8% improvement), and limiting spinal cord maximum
dose error to within 0.1 Gy. The average plan generation time per case is
reduced to 22 seconds. Ablation studies confirm that the structural encoder
enhances compliance with clinical dose constraints by 28.5%. To our knowledge,
this is the first study to introduce a conditional diffusion model framework
for radiotherapy dose prediction, offering a generalizable and efficient
solution for automated treatment planning across diverse tumor sites, with the
potential to substantially reduce planning time and improve clinical workflow
efficiency.

Motivation: 现有数据集（如Mapillary）的标注过于粗粒度，无法区分语义重要的交通标志类型，影响自动驾驶决策的准确性。

Method: 从Mapillary数据集中提取并手动标注细粒度交通标志类别，生成MVV验证集，并对比DINOv2与VLM模型的性能。

Conclusion: MVV数据集和DINOv2为自动驾驶场景中的细粒度视觉理解提供了可靠基准，推动了更可解释和可扩展的感知系统发展。

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality fine-grained annotations for traffic signs is critical
for accurate and safe decision-making in autonomous driving. Widely used
datasets, such as Mapillary, often provide only coarse-grained labels - without
distinguishing semantically important types such as stop signs or speed limit
signs. To this end, we present a new validation set for traffic signs derived
from the Mapillary dataset called Mapillary Vistas Validation for Traffic Signs
(MVV), where we decompose composite traffic signs into granular, semantically
meaningful categories. The dataset includes pixel-level instance masks and has
been manually annotated by expert annotators to ensure label fidelity. Further,
we benchmark several state-of-the-art VLMs against the self-supervised DINOv2
model on this dataset and show that DINOv2 consistently outperforms all VLM
baselines-not only on traffic sign recognition, but also on heavily represented
categories like vehicles and humans. Our analysis reveals significant
limitations in current vision-language models for fine-grained visual
understanding and establishes DINOv2 as a strong baseline for dense semantic
matching in autonomous driving scenarios. This dataset and evaluation framework
pave the way for more reliable, interpretable, and scalable perception systems.

Motivation: 解决分布式多阶段图像压缩中渐进方法计算资源利用率低、连续压缩效率低且质量损失累积的问题。

Method: 采用分层级联框架（HCF），通过潜在空间转换和策略驱动的量化控制优化率失真权衡。

Result: 在多个数据集上，HCF在PSNR和计算效率上显著优于现有方法，最高提升0.6dB PSNR，节省97.8% FLOPs。

Conclusion: HCF为分布式图像压缩提供了高效、灵活的解决方案，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Distributed multi-stage image compression -- where visual content traverses
multiple processing nodes under varying quality requirements -- poses
challenges. Progressive methods enable bitstream truncation but underutilize
available compute resources; successive compression repeats costly pixel-domain
operations and suffers cumulative quality loss and inefficiency;
fixed-parameter models lack post-encoding flexibility. In this work, we
developed the Hierarchical Cascade Framework (HCF) that achieves high
rate-distortion performance and better computational efficiency through direct
latent-space transformations across network nodes in distributed multi-stage
image compression system. Under HCF, we introduced policy-driven quantization
control to optimize rate-distortion trade-offs, and established the edge
quantization principle through differential entropy analysis. The configuration
based on this principle demonstrates up to 0.6dB PSNR gains over other
configurations. When comprehensively evaluated on the Kodak, CLIC, and
CLIC2020-mobile datasets, HCF outperforms successive-compression methods by up
to 5.56% BD-Rate in PSNR on CLIC, while saving up to 97.8% FLOPs, 96.5% GPU
memory, and 90.0% execution time. It also outperforms state-of-the-art
progressive compression methods by up to 12.64% BD-Rate on Kodak and enables
retraining-free cross-quality adaptation with 7.13-10.87% BD-Rate reductions on
CLIC2020-mobile.

Result: 在基准数据集上，StarPose优于现有方法，实现了更高的准确性和时间一致性。

Conclusion: StarPose通过自回归扩散和时空物理指导，显著提升了3D人体姿态估计的性能。

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation remains a challenging task due to inherent
depth ambiguities and occlusions. Compared to traditional methods based on
Transformers or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), recent diffusion-based
approaches have shown superior performance, leveraging their probabilistic
nature and high-fidelity generation capabilities. However, these methods often
fail to account for the spatial and temporal correlations across predicted
frames, resulting in limited temporal consistency and inferior accuracy in
predicted 3D pose sequences. To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes
StarPose, an autoregressive diffusion framework that effectively incorporates
historical 3D pose predictions and spatial-temporal physical guidance to
significantly enhance both the accuracy and temporal coherence of pose
predictions. Unlike existing approaches, StarPose models the 2D-to-3D pose
mapping as an autoregressive diffusion process. By synergically integrating
previously predicted 3D poses with 2D pose inputs via a Historical Pose
Integration Module (HPIM), the framework generates rich and informative
historical pose embeddings that guide subsequent denoising steps, ensuring
temporally consistent predictions. In addition, a fully plug-and-play
Spatial-Temporal Physical Guidance (STPG) mechanism is tailored to refine the
denoising process in an iterative manner, which further enforces spatial
anatomical plausibility and temporal motion dynamics, rendering robust and
realistic pose estimates. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that StarPose outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving
superior accuracy and temporal consistency in 3D human pose estimation. Code is

Conclusion: 结构化报告和定制评估指标（S-Score）显著提升了放射学报告生成的临床相关性和质量。

Abstract: Radiology report generation (RRG) for diagnostic images, such as chest
X-rays, plays a pivotal role in both clinical practice and AI. Traditional
free-text reports suffer from redundancy and inconsistent language,
complicating the extraction of critical clinical details. Structured radiology
report generation (S-RRG) offers a promising solution by organizing information
into standardized, concise formats. However, existing approaches often rely on
classification or visual question answering (VQA) pipelines that require
predefined label sets and produce only fragmented outputs. Template-based
approaches, which generate reports by replacing keywords within fixed sentence
patterns, further compromise expressiveness and often omit clinically important
details. In this work, we present a novel approach to S-RRG that includes
dataset construction, model training, and the introduction of a new evaluation
framework. We first create a robust chest X-ray dataset (MIMIC-STRUC) that
includes disease names, severity levels, probabilities, and anatomical
locations, ensuring that the dataset is both clinically relevant and
well-structured. We train an LLM-based model to generate standardized,
high-quality reports. To assess the generated reports, we propose a specialized
evaluation metric (S-Score) that not only measures disease prediction accuracy
but also evaluates the precision of disease-specific details, thus offering a
clinically meaningful metric for report quality that focuses on elements
critical to clinical decision-making and demonstrates a stronger alignment with
human assessments. Our approach highlights the effectiveness of structured
reports and the importance of a tailored evaluation metric for S-RRG, providing
a more clinically relevant measure of report quality.

Method: 通过构建包含真实和合成视频的VLM4D基准测试，评估VLMs在平移、旋转、视角感知和运动连续性等方面的表现。

Result: 现有VLMs在时空推理能力上与人类基线存在显著差距，尤其在整合多视觉线索和保持时间一致性上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 研究提出了4D特征场重建和时空监督微调等改进方向，为提升VLMs的动态环境理解能力提供了新思路。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in
integrating linguistic and visual reasoning but remain fundamentally limited in
understanding dynamic spatiotemporal interactions. Humans effortlessly track
and reason about object movements, rotations, and perspective shifts-abilities
essential for robust dynamic real-world understanding yet notably lacking in
current VLMs. In this paper, we introduce VLM4D, the first benchmark
specifically designed to evaluate the spatiotemporal reasoning capabilities of
VLMs. Our benchmark comprises diverse real-world and synthetic videos
accompanied by carefully curated question-answer pairs emphasizing
translational and rotational motions, perspective awareness, and motion
continuity. Through comprehensive evaluations of state-of-the-art open and
closed-source VLMs, we identify significant performance gaps compared to human
baselines, highlighting fundamental deficiencies in existing models. Extensive
analysis reveals that VLMs struggle particularly with integrating multiple
visual cues and maintaining temporal coherence. We further explore promising
directions, such as leveraging 4D feature field reconstruction and targeted
spatiotemporal supervised fine-tuning, demonstrating their effectiveness in
enhancing spatiotemporal comprehension. Our work aims to encourage deeper
exploration into improving VLMs' spatial and temporal grounding, paving the way
towards more capable and reliable visual intelligence for dynamic environments.

TL;DR: Human-X框架实时合成物理合理的人类交互，提升VR/AR和人形机器人系统的沉浸感和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在实时响应、物理可行性和安全性之间的冲突，提升动态人机交互的质量。

Method: 采用自回归反应扩散规划器联合预测动作和反应，并结合强化学习的运动跟踪策略增强物理真实性和安全性。

Result: 在Inter-X和InterHuman数据集上显著提升了运动质量、交互连续性和物理合理性。

Conclusion: Human-X框架在虚拟现实和机器人交互中展示了推动人机协作的潜力。

Abstract: Real-time synthesis of physically plausible human interactions remains a
critical challenge for immersive VR/AR systems and humanoid robotics. While
existing methods demonstrate progress in kinematic motion generation, they
often fail to address the fundamental tension between real-time responsiveness,
physical feasibility, and safety requirements in dynamic human-machine
interactions. We introduce Human-X, a novel framework designed to enable
immersive and physically plausible human interactions across diverse entities,
including human-avatar, human-humanoid, and human-robot systems. Unlike
existing approaches that focus on post-hoc alignment or simplified physics, our
method jointly predicts actions and reactions in real-time using an
auto-regressive reaction diffusion planner, ensuring seamless synchronization
and context-aware responses. To enhance physical realism and safety, we
integrate an actor-aware motion tracking policy trained with reinforcement
learning, which dynamically adapts to interaction partners' movements while
avoiding artifacts like foot sliding and penetration. Extensive experiments on
the Inter-X and InterHuman datasets demonstrate significant improvements in
motion quality, interaction continuity, and physical plausibility over
state-of-the-art methods. Our framework is validated in real-world
applications, including virtual reality interface for human-robot interaction,
showcasing its potential for advancing human-robot collaboration.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新框架，通过语义驱动的LoRA检索和动态聚合解决现有LoRA模块部署中的三大挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大规模模型在图像生成方面取得进展，但实际部署仍受限于参数微调的困难。现有LoRA模块面临稀疏元数据标注、零样本适应需求和多LoRA融合策略不佳的问题。

Method: 框架包含两部分：(1)基于权重编码的LoRA检索器，建立LoRA参数矩阵与文本提示的共享语义空间；(2)细粒度门控融合机制，动态计算融合权重以优化多LoRA模块集成。

Result: 显著提升了图像生成性能，实现了基础模型的可扩展和数据高效增强。

Conclusion: 该框架填补了社区开发LoRA与实际部署需求之间的鸿沟，通过标准化适配器集成促进协作模型演进。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in photorealistic image generation through
large-scale models like FLUX and Stable Diffusion v3, the practical deployment
of these architectures remains constrained by their inherent intractability to
parameter fine-tuning. While low-rank adaptation (LoRA) have demonstrated
efficacy in enabling model customization with minimal parameter overhead, the
effective utilization of distributed open-source LoRA modules faces three
critical challenges: sparse metadata annotation, the requirement for zero-shot
adaptation capabilities, and suboptimal fusion strategies for multi-LoRA fusion
strategies. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel framework that
enables semantic-driven LoRA retrieval and dynamic aggregation through two key
components: (1) weight encoding-base LoRA retriever that establishes a shared
semantic space between LoRA parameter matrices and text prompts, eliminating
dependence on original training data, and (2) fine-grained gated fusion
mechanism that computes context-specific fusion weights across network layers
and diffusion timesteps to optimally integrate multiple LoRA modules during
generation. Our approach achieves significant improvement in image generation
perfermance, thereby facilitating scalable and data-efficient enhancement of
foundational models. This work establishes a critical bridge between the
fragmented landscape of community-developed LoRAs and practical deployment
requirements, enabling collaborative model evolution through standardized
adapter integration.

*Mingjie Liu,Hanqing Liu,Chuang Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出NRE-Net，通过融合RGB图像、事件流和预测的法线图，提升恶劣光照条件下的物体检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恶劣光照条件下，RGB和事件数据单独使用均不足以应对复杂场景（如反射干扰），需多模态融合方法。

Method: NRE-Net结合RGB、事件流和法线图，采用ADFM和EAFM模块优化多模态特征融合。

Result: 在DSEC-Det-sub和PKU-DAVIS-SOD数据集上，NRE-Net显著优于现有方法，mAP50提升最高达7.9%。

Conclusion: 法线图作为几何线索能有效抑制误检，多模态融合显著提升检测性能。

Abstract: Accurate object detection under adverse lighting conditions is critical for
real-world applications such as autonomous driving. Although neuromorphic event
cameras have been introduced to handle these scenarios, adverse lighting often
induces distracting reflections from tunnel walls or road surfaces, which
frequently lead to false obstacle detections. However, neither RGB nor event
data alone is robust enough to address these complexities, and mitigating these
issues without additional sensors remains underexplored. To overcome these
challenges, we propose leveraging normal maps, directly predicted from
monocular RGB images, as robust geometric cues to suppress false positives and
enhance detection accuracy. We introduce NRE-Net, a novel multi-modal detection
framework that effectively fuses three complementary modalities: monocularly
predicted surface normal maps, RGB images, and event streams. To optimize the
fusion process, our framework incorporates two key modules: the Adaptive
Dual-stream Fusion Module (ADFM), which integrates RGB and normal map features,
and the Event-modality Aware Fusion Module (EAFM), which adapts to the high
dynamic range characteristics of event data. Extensive evaluations on the
DSEC-Det-sub and PKU-DAVIS-SOD datasets demonstrate that NRE-Net significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our approach achieves mAP50 improvements
of 7.9% and 6.1% over frame-based approaches (e.g., YOLOX), while surpassing
the fusion-based SFNet by 2.7% on the DSEC-Det-sub dataset and SODFormer by
7.1% on the PKU-DAVIS-SOD dataset.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖预校准对象轨迹或难以处理快速移动物体，导致时间不连续性和重建精度不足。

Method: 结合视频扩散模型提取时间一致性先验，引入联合时间戳优化和不确定性蒸馏方法。

Result: 实验显示，新方法显著提升动态建模效果，PSNR增益约2 dB。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了动态场景建模中的时间连续性和精度问题，尤其在快速移动物体上表现突出。

Abstract: Dynamic urban scene modeling is a rapidly evolving area with broad
applications. While current approaches leveraging neural radiance fields or
Gaussian Splatting have achieved fine-grained reconstruction and high-fidelity
novel view synthesis, they still face significant limitations. These often stem
from a dependence on pre-calibrated object tracks or difficulties in accurately
modeling fast-moving objects from undersampled capture, particularly due to
challenges in handling temporal discontinuities. To overcome these issues, we
propose a novel video diffusion-enhanced 4D Gaussian Splatting framework. Our
key insight is to distill robust, temporally consistent priors from a test-time
adapted video diffusion model. To ensure precise pose alignment and effective
integration of this denoised content, we introduce two core innovations: a
joint timestamp optimization strategy that refines interpolated frame poses,
and an uncertainty distillation method that adaptively extracts target content
while preserving well-reconstructed regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method significantly enhances dynamic modeling, especially for
fast-moving objects, achieving an approximate PSNR gain of 2 dB for novel view
synthesis over baseline approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于感知的神经网络质量度量方法，用于直接评估BRDF模型的质量，无需渲染过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统BRDF空间度量方法依赖数值误差，无法捕捉渲染图像中的感知差异。

Method: 使用多层感知机（MLP）作为度量模型，输入参考和近似BRDF样本，预测JOD分数。

Result: 该神经度量与人类判断的相关性显著高于现有BRDF空间度量。

Conclusion: 该度量方法为BRDF模型评估提供了感知基础，但在拟合中作为损失函数的性能有限。

Abstract: Accurately evaluating the quality of bidirectional reflectance distribution
function (BRDF) models is essential for photo-realistic rendering. Traditional
BRDF-space metrics often employ numerical error measures that fail to capture
perceptual differences evident in rendered images. In this paper, we introduce
the first perceptually informed neural quality metric for BRDF evaluation that
operates directly in BRDF space, eliminating the need for rendering during
quality assessment. Our metric is implemented as a compact multi-layer
perceptron (MLP), trained on a dataset of measured BRDFs supplemented with
synthetically generated data and labelled using a perceptually validated
image-space metric. The network takes as input paired samples of reference and
approximated BRDFs and predicts their perceptual quality in terms of
just-objectionable-difference (JOD) scores. We show that our neural metric
achieves significantly higher correlation with human judgments than existing
BRDF-space metrics. While its performance as a loss function for BRDF fitting
remains limited, the proposed metric offers a perceptually grounded alternative
for evaluating BRDF models.

TL;DR: Free-MoRef是一种无需训练的方法，通过多参考注意力机制和并行处理长视频帧，显著提升了视频多模态大语言模型（Video-MLLM）在长视频场景下的性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Video-MLLM受限于上下文长度，在长视频场景中表现不佳，常见解决方案牺牲了特征粒度或推理效率。

Method: 提出Free-MoRef，通过重构视觉令牌为多参考序列，并行处理并融合关键令牌，实现高效长视频理解。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Free-MoRef支持2×至8×更长的输入帧，性能显著提升，且计算成本更低。

Conclusion: Free-MoRef为长视频理解提供了一种高效且无需训练的解决方案，性能优于专用训练模型。

Abstract: Video Multimodal Large Language Models~(Video-MLLM) have achieved remarkable
advancements in video understanding tasks. However, constrained by the context
length limitation in the underlying LLMs, existing Video-MLLMs typically
exhibit suboptimal performance on long video scenarios. To understand extended
input frames, common solutions span token compression and streaming inference
techniques, which sacrifice feature granularity or inference efficiency.
Differently, to efficiently achieve comprehensive understanding of longer frame
inputs, we draw ideas from MoE and propose a training-free approach
\textbf{Free-MoRef}, which instantly multiplexes the context perception
capabilities of Video-MLLMs within one inference pass. Specifically, Free-MoRef
reconstructs the vision tokens into several short sequences as
multi-references. Subsequently, we introduce MoRef-attention, which gathers
clues from the multi-reference chunks in parallel to summarize unified query
activations. After the shadow layers in LLMs, a reference fusion step is
derived to compose a final mixed reasoning sequence with key tokens from
parallel chunks, which compensates the cross-reference vision interactions that
are neglected in MoRef-attention. By splitting and fusing the long vision token
sequences, Free-MoRef achieves improved performance under much lower computing
costs in reasoning multiplexed context length, demonstrating strong efficiency
and effectiveness. Experiments on VideoMME, MLVU, LongVideoBench show that
Free-MoRef achieves full perception of 2$\times$ to 8$\times$ longer input
frames without compression on a single A100 GPU while keeping instant
responses, thereby bringing significant performance gains, even surpassing
dedicatedly trained long-video-MLLMs. Codes are available at

Motivation: 研究如何利用航拍图像为自动驾驶车辆提供环境上下文，尤其是在高清地图不可用或维护成本高的情况下。

Method: 通过SLAM点云地图将航拍图像与nuScenes坐标系对齐，提出校正流程和人工质量控制，生成高质量对齐数据集。

Result: 实验表明，航拍图像使地图构建精度提升15-23%，轨迹预测性能提升2%。

Conclusion: 航拍图像是自动驾驶系统中可扩展且适应性强的环境信息来源，AID4AD数据集及相关资源已公开以促进研究。

Abstract: This work investigates the integration of spatially aligned aerial imagery
into perception tasks for automated vehicles (AVs). As a central contribution,
we present AID4AD, a publicly available dataset that augments the nuScenes
dataset with high-resolution aerial imagery precisely aligned to its local
coordinate system. The alignment is performed using SLAM-based point cloud maps
provided by nuScenes, establishing a direct link between aerial data and
nuScenes local coordinate system. To ensure spatial fidelity, we propose an
alignment workflow that corrects for localization and projection distortions. A
manual quality control process further refines the dataset by identifying a set
of high-quality alignments, which we publish as ground truth to support future
research on automated registration. We demonstrate the practical value of
AID4AD in two representative tasks: in online map construction, aerial imagery
serves as a complementary input that improves the mapping process; in motion
prediction, it functions as a structured environmental representation that
replaces high-definition maps. Experiments show that aerial imagery leads to a
15-23% improvement in map construction accuracy and a 2% gain in trajectory
prediction performance. These results highlight the potential of aerial imagery
as a scalable and adaptable source of environmental context in automated
vehicle systems, particularly in scenarios where high-definition maps are
unavailable, outdated, or costly to maintain. AID4AD, along with evaluation
code and pretrained models, is publicly released to foster further research in
this direction: https://github.com/DriverlessMobility/AID4AD.

Motivation: 真实监控场景中的步态识别面临非周期性和遮挡问题，现有方法难以应对。

Method: 提出TrackletGait框架，包括随机轨迹采样、Haar小波下采样和硬度排除三元组损失。

Result: 在Gait3D和GREW数据集上分别达到77.8和80.4的rank-1准确率，仅需10.3M参数。

Conclusion: TrackletGait在真实场景中表现出色，为步态识别提供了新思路。

Abstract: Gait recognition aims to identify individuals based on their body shape and
walking patterns. Though much progress has been achieved driven by deep
learning, gait recognition in real-world surveillance scenarios remains quite
challenging to current methods. Conventional approaches, which rely on periodic
gait cycles and controlled environments, struggle with the non-periodic and
occluded silhouette sequences encountered in the wild. In this paper, we
propose a novel framework, TrackletGait, designed to address these challenges
in the wild. We propose Random Tracklet Sampling, a generalization of existing
sampling methods, which strikes a balance between robustness and representation
in capturing diverse walking patterns. Next, we introduce Haar Wavelet-based
Downsampling to preserve information during spatial downsampling. Finally, we
present a Hardness Exclusion Triplet Loss, designed to exclude low-quality
silhouettes by discarding hard triplet samples. TrackletGait achieves
state-of-the-art results, with 77.8 and 80.4 rank-1 accuracy on the Gait3D and
GREW datasets, respectively, while using only 10.3M backbone parameters.
Extensive experiments are also conducted to further investigate the factors
affecting gait recognition in the wild.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏真正的语义理解，且联合训练推理和分割会降低像素级精度。

Method: 采用结构化思维链提示机制和特征蒸馏损失，结合两阶段训练策略（自校正和强化学习）。

Result: AURORA在Ref-AVS基准测试中达到最优性能，并能泛化到无参考分割任务。

Conclusion: AURORA通过增强推理能力和语言理解，显著提升了参考音频-视觉分割的性能。

Abstract: Reference Audio-Visual Segmentation (Ref-AVS) tasks challenge models to
precisely locate sounding objects by integrating visual, auditory, and textual
cues. Existing methods often lack genuine semantic understanding, tending to
memorize fixed reasoning patterns. Furthermore, jointly training for reasoning
and segmentation can compromise pixel-level precision. To address these issues,
we introduce AURORA, a novel framework designed to enhance genuine reasoning
and language comprehension in reference audio-visual segmentation. We employ a
structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting mechanism to guide the model
through a step-by-step reasoning process and introduce a novel segmentation
feature distillation loss to effectively integrate these reasoning abilities
without sacrificing segmentation performance. To further cultivate the model's
genuine reasoning capabilities, we devise a further two-stage training
strategy: first, a ``corrective reflective-style training" stage utilizes
self-correction to enhance the quality of reasoning paths, followed by
reinforcement learning via Group Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) to bolster
robustness in challenging scenarios. Experiments demonstrate that AURORA
achieves state-of-the-art performance on Ref-AVS benchmarks and generalizes
effectively to unreferenced segmentation.

TL;DR: AttriCtrl是一个即插即用的框架，用于精确和连续控制生成图像的美学属性，解决了现有方法依赖模糊文本提示或高成本人类偏好数据的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在美学属性的细粒度控制上存在不足，文本提示模糊且依赖高成本数据，限制了其可扩展性和实用性。

Method: 通过预训练的视觉语言模型量化美学语义，并使用轻量级值编码器将标量强度映射到可学习的嵌入中，实现美学属性的连续控制。

Result: AttriCtrl实现了对单个属性的精确控制和多属性的灵活组合，且与现有生成框架兼容。

Conclusion: AttriCtrl提供了一种高效、直观的美学控制方法，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in text-to-image diffusion models have significantly
enhanced both the visual fidelity and semantic controllability of generated
images. However, fine-grained control over aesthetic attributes remains
challenging, especially when users require continuous and intensity-specific
adjustments. Existing approaches often rely on vague textual prompts, which are
inherently ambiguous in expressing both the aesthetic semantics and the desired
intensity, or depend on costly human preference data for alignment, limiting
their scalability and practicality. To address these limitations, we propose
AttriCtrl, a plug-and-play framework for precise and continuous control of
aesthetic attributes. Specifically, we quantify abstract aesthetics by
leveraging semantic similarity from pre-trained vision-language models, and
employ a lightweight value encoder that maps scalar intensities in $[0,1]$ to
learnable embeddings within diffusion-based generation. This design enables
intuitive and customizable aesthetic manipulation, with minimal training
overhead and seamless integration into existing generation pipelines. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that AttriCtrl achieves accurate control over
individual attributes as well as flexible multi-attribute composition.
Moreover, it is fully compatible with popular open-source controllable
generation frameworks, showcasing strong integration capability and practical
utility across diverse generation scenarios.

Conclusion: DreamPainter框架和DreamEcom-400K数据集有效解决了电商背景生成任务中的关键问题。

Abstract: Although diffusion-based image genenation has been widely explored and
applied, background generation tasks in e-commerce scenarios still face
significant challenges. The first challenge is to ensure that the generated
products are consistent with the given product inputs while maintaining a
reasonable spatial arrangement, harmonious shadows, and reflections between
foreground products and backgrounds. Existing inpainting methods fail to
address this due to the lack of domain-specific data. The second challenge
involves the limitation of relying solely on text prompts for image control, as
effective integrating visual information to achieve precise control in
inpainting tasks remains underexplored. To address these challenges, we
introduce DreamEcom-400K, a high-quality e-commerce dataset containing accurate
product instance masks, background reference images, text prompts, and
aesthetically pleasing product images. Based on this dataset, we propose
DreamPainter, a novel framework that not only utilizes text prompts for control
but also flexibly incorporates reference image information as an additional
control signal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, maintaining high product
consistency while effectively integrating both text prompt and reference image
information.

Conclusion: 统一框架在RGB图像上的检测和姿态估计任务中表现优异，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Recognizing objects in images is a fundamental problem in computer vision.
Although detecting objects in 2D images is common, many applications require
determining their pose in 3D space. Traditional category-level methods rely on
RGB-D inputs, which may not always be available, or employ two-stage approaches
that use separate models and representations for detection and pose estimation.
For the first time, we introduce a unified model that integrates detection and
pose estimation into a single framework for RGB images by leveraging neural
mesh models with learned features and multi-model RANSAC. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results for RGB category-level pose estimation on REAL275,
improving on the current state-of-the-art by 22.9% averaged across all
scale-agnostic metrics. Finally, we demonstrate that our unified method
exhibits greater robustness compared to single-stage baselines. Our code and
models are available at

Conclusion: EST-LoRA无需训练，高效平衡主题和风格生成，性能优越。

Abstract: Fine-tuning models via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) demonstrates remarkable
performance in subject-driven or style-driven generation tasks. Studies have
explored combinations of different LoRAs to jointly generate learned styles and
content. However, current methods struggle to balance the original subject and
style, and often require additional training. Recently, K-LoRA proposed a
training-free LoRA fusion method. But it involves multiple hyperparameters,
making it difficult to adapt to all styles and subjects. In this paper, we
propose EST-LoRA, a training-free adaptive LoRA fusion method. It
comprehensively considers three critical factors: \underline{E}nergy of matrix,
\underline{S}tyle discrepancy scores and \underline{T}ime steps. Analogous to
the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, the model adaptively selects between
subject LoRA and style LoRA within each attention layer. This integrated
selection mechanism ensures balanced contributions from both components during
the generation process. Experimental results show that EST-LoRA outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations and
achieves faster generation speed compared to other efficient fusion approaches.

Conclusion: CL3AN数据集和新方法为复杂光照下的图像恢复提供了有效解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Illumination in practical scenarios is inherently complex, involving colored
light sources, occlusions, and diverse material interactions that produce
intricate reflectance and shading effects. However, existing methods often
oversimplify this challenge by assuming a single light source or uniform,
white-balanced lighting, leaving many of these complexities unaddressed.In this
paper, we introduce CL3AN, the first large-scale, high-resolution dataset of
its kind designed to facilitate the restoration of images captured under
multiple Colored Light sources to their Ambient-Normalized counterparts.
Through benchmarking, we find that leading approaches often produce artifacts,
such as illumination inconsistencies, texture leakage, and color distortion,
primarily due to their limited ability to precisely disentangle illumination
from reflectance. Motivated by this insight, we achieve such a desired
decomposition through a novel learning framework that leverages explicit
chromaticity and luminance components guidance, drawing inspiration from the

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GaussianCross是一种新颖的跨模态自监督3D表示学习架构，通过3D高斯喷洒技术解决现有模型的点云表示问题，并在多个基准测试中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督预训练方法因点云区分难度不足导致模型崩溃和结构信息缺失，影响性能和可靠性。

Method: 提出GaussianCross，结合3D高斯喷洒技术，将点云转换为统一的高斯表示，并通过三属性自适应蒸馏模块构建3D特征场。

Result: 在ScanNet等基准测试中表现优异，参数和数据效率高，线性探测和有限数据训练下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GaussianCross在3D场景理解中具有显著优势，支持跨模态一致性，并显著提升语义和实例分割任务性能。

Abstract: The significance of informative and robust point representations has been
widely acknowledged for 3D scene understanding. Despite existing
self-supervised pre-training counterparts demonstrating promising performance,
the model collapse and structural information deficiency remain prevalent due
to insufficient point discrimination difficulty, yielding unreliable
expressions and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we present
GaussianCross, a novel cross-modal self-supervised 3D representation learning
architecture integrating feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) techniques
to address current challenges. GaussianCross seamlessly converts
scale-inconsistent 3D point clouds into a unified cuboid-normalized Gaussian
representation without missing details, enabling stable and generalizable
pre-training. Subsequently, a tri-attribute adaptive distillation splatting
module is incorporated to construct a 3D feature field, facilitating synergetic
feature capturing of appearance, geometry, and semantic cues to maintain
cross-modal consistency. To validate GaussianCross, we perform extensive
evaluations on various benchmarks, including ScanNet, ScanNet200, and S3DIS. In
particular, GaussianCross shows a prominent parameter and data efficiency,
achieving superior performance through linear probing (<0.1% parameters) and
limited data training (1% of scenes) compared to state-of-the-art methods.
Furthermore, GaussianCross demonstrates strong generalization capabilities,
improving the full fine-tuning accuracy by 9.3% mIoU and 6.1% AP$_{50}$ on
ScanNet200 semantic and instance segmentation tasks, respectively, supporting
the effectiveness of our approach. The code, weights, and visualizations are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DICOM文件中的个人可识别信息（PII）和个人健康识别信息（PHI）需要去标识化以符合HIPAA等隐私法规要求。

Method: 采用基于HIPAA安全港方法的算法，通过自定义参数分类并去标识化DICOM标签。

Result: 成功识别并去标识化敏感信息（如姓名、病史、个人数据和机构信息）。

Conclusion: 开发的算法灵活且适用于日常使用和研究，代码已开源。

Abstract: Background : De-identification of DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communi-cations
in Medicine) files is an essential component of medical image research.
Personal Identifiable Information (PII) and/or Personal Health Identifying
Information (PHI) need to be hidden or removed due to legal reasons. According
to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and privacy
rules, also full-face photographic images and any compa-rable images are direct
identifiers and are considered protected health information that also need to
be de-identified. Objective : The study aimed to implement a method that permit
to de-identify the PII and PHI information present in the header and burned on
the pixel data of DICOM. Methods : To execute the de-identification, we
implemented an algorithm based on the safe harbor method, defined by HIPAA. Our
algorithm uses input customizable parameter to classify and then possibly
de-identify individual DICOM tags. Results : The most sensible information,
like names, history, personal data and institution were successfully
recognized. Conclusions : We developed a python algorithm that is able to
classify infor-mation present in a DICOM file. The flexibility provided by the
use of customi-zable input parameters, which allow the user to customize the
entire process de-pending on the case (e.g., the language), makes the entire
program very promis-ing for both everyday use and research purposes. Our code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfake视频的传播引发了信任危机和社会不稳定，现有方法在弱监督多模态细粒度时间伪造定位（WS-MTFL）方面缺乏系统性研究。

Method: 通过多任务学习框架整合视觉和音频模态检测任务，采用Mixture-of-Experts结构自适应选择特征和定位头，并提出特征增强模块和可扩展偏差感知损失。

Result: WMMT在WS-MTFL中表现出色，多项评估指标接近全监督方法。

Conclusion: 多任务学习在WS-MTFL中有效，WMMT为弱监督方法提供了高灵活性和定位精度。

Abstract: The spread of Deepfake videos has caused a trust crisis and impaired social
stability. Although numerous approaches have been proposed to address the
challenges of Deepfake detection and localization, there is still a lack of
systematic research on the weakly supervised multimodal fine-grained temporal
forgery localization (WS-MTFL). In this paper, we propose a novel weakly
supervised multimodal temporal forgery localization via multitask learning
(WMMT), which addresses the WS-MTFL under the multitask learning paradigm. WMMT
achieves multimodal fine-grained Deepfake detection and temporal partial
forgery localization using merely video-level annotations. Specifically, visual
and audio modality detection are formulated as two binary classification tasks.
The multitask learning paradigm is introduced to integrate these tasks into a
multimodal task. Furthermore, WMMT utilizes a Mixture-of-Experts structure to
adaptively select appropriate features and localization head, achieving
excellent flexibility and localization precision in WS-MTFL. A feature
enhancement module with temporal property preserving attention mechanism is
proposed to identify the intra- and inter-modality feature deviation and
construct comprehensive video features. To further explore the temporal
information for weakly supervised learning, an extensible deviation perceiving
loss has been proposed, which aims to enlarge the deviation of adjacent
segments of the forged samples and reduce the deviation of genuine samples.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of multitask learning for
WS-MTFL, and the WMMT achieves comparable results to fully supervised
approaches in several evaluation metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化模型在动态环境中性能下降严重，现有测试时适应（TTA）方法因依赖梯度反向传播而不适用于量化模型。

Method: 提出ZOA框架，仅需两次前向传播，避免梯度计算；设计领域知识管理方案，减少不同领域知识的干扰。

Result: 在量化W6A6 ViT-B模型上，ZOA在ImageNet-C数据集上比现有方法提升5.0%。

Conclusion: ZOA框架为量化模型提供了一种高效、鲁棒的测试时适应方法，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Quantizing deep models prior to deployment is a widely adopted technique to
speed up inference for various real-time applications, such as autonomous
driving. However, quantized models often suffer from severe performance
degradation in dynamic environments with potential domain shifts and this
degradation is significantly more pronounced compared with their full-precision
counterparts, as shown by our theoretical and empirical illustrations. To
address the domain shift problem, test-time adaptation (TTA) has emerged as an
effective solution by enabling models to learn adaptively from test data.
Unfortunately, existing TTA methods are often impractical for quantized models
as they typically rely on gradient backpropagation--an operation that is
unsupported on quantized models due to vanishing gradients, as well as memory
and latency constraints. In this paper, we focus on TTA for quantized models to
improve their robustness and generalization ability efficiently. We propose a
continual zeroth-order adaptation (ZOA) framework that enables efficient model
adaptation using only two forward passes, eliminating the computational burden
of existing methods. Moreover, we propose a domain knowledge management scheme
to store and reuse different domain knowledge with negligible memory
consumption, reducing the interference of different domain knowledge and
fostering the knowledge accumulation during long-term adaptation. Experimental
results on three classical architectures, including quantized transformer-based
and CNN-based models, demonstrate the superiority of our methods for quantized
model adaptation. On the quantized W6A6 ViT-B model, our ZOA is able to achieve
a 5.0\% improvement over the state-of-the-art FOA on ImageNet-C dataset. The

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的对抗训练方法RPAT，通过优化感知一致性来缓解干净准确性和对抗鲁棒性之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对抗训练（AT）在提升模型鲁棒性的同时会降低干净准确性，作者发现这是由于对难对抗样本的过度学习导致决策边界退化。

Method: 定义了新的对抗训练目标“鲁棒感知”，并提出了RPAT方法，鼓励模型感知随输入扰动平滑变化。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型上验证了RPAT的有效性，优于常见基线和12个SOTA方法。

Conclusion: RPAT通过优化感知一致性，有效缓解了准确性和鲁棒性的权衡问题。

Abstract: Adversarial Training (AT) is one of the most effective methods to train
robust Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, AT creates an inherent trade-off
between clean accuracy and adversarial robustness, which is commonly attributed
to the more complicated decision boundary caused by the insufficient learning
of hard adversarial samples. In this work, we reveal a counterintuitive fact
for the first time: From the perspective of perception consistency, hard
adversarial samples that can still attack the robust model after AT are already
learned better than those successfully defended. Thus, different from previous
views, we argue that it is rather the over-sufficient learning of hard
adversarial samples that degrades the decision boundary and contributes to the
trade-off problem. Specifically, the excessive pursuit of perception
consistency would force the model to view the perturbations as noise and ignore
the information within them, which should have been utilized to induce a
smoother perception transition towards the decision boundary to support its
establishment to an appropriate location. In response, we define a new AT
objective named Robust Perception, encouraging the model perception to change
smoothly with input perturbations, based on which we propose a novel Robust
Perception Adversarial Training (RPAT) method, effectively mitigating the
current accuracy-robustness trade-off. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and
Tiny-ImageNet with ResNet-18, PreActResNet-18, and WideResNet-34-10 demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method beyond four common baselines and 12
state-of-the-art (SOTA) works. The code is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种内容自适应的Mamba模型（CAM），通过动态调整扫描方式和引入全局先验，显著提升了图像压缩的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的Mamba模型在图像压缩中因固定扫描方式和缺乏内容适应性而表现受限。

Method: CAM通过内容感知的令牌重组和全局先验提示字典，动态优化扫描过程。

Result: 基于CAM的LIC模型（CMIC）在多个基准测试中BD-rate显著优于VTM-21.0。

Conclusion: CAM通过内容自适应和全局先验的引入，显著提升了图像压缩的性能和效率。

Abstract: Recent Learned image compression (LIC) leverages Mamba-style state-space
models (SSMs) for global receptive fields with linear complexity. However,
vanilla Mamba is content-agnostic, relying on fixed and predefined selective
scans, which restricts its ability to dynamically and fully exploit content
dependencies. We introduce Content-Adaptive Mamba (CAM), a dynamic SSM that
addresses two critical limitations. First, it employs content-aware token
reorganization, clustering and reordering tokens based on content similarity to
prioritize proximity in feature space over Euclidean space. Second, it
integrates global priors into SSM via a prompt dictionary, effectively
mitigating the strict causality and long-range decay in the token interactions
of Mamba. These innovations enable CAM to better capture global dependencies
while preserving computational efficiency. Leveraging CAM, our Content-Adaptive
Mamba-based LIC model (CMIC) achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion
performance, surpassing VTM-21.0 by -15.91\%, -21.34\%, and -17.58\% BD-rate on
Kodak, Tecnick, and CLIC benchmarks, respectively.

Motivation: WSI分析在癌症诊断中至关重要，但处理大尺寸WSI需要大量资源。现有模型需要持续适应新任务，而无需重新训练历史数据，以平衡资源效率与性能。

Method: 提出COSFormer，一种Transformer框架，支持从新任务中持续学习，避免重新访问历史数据集。

Result: 在七种WSI数据集和六种任务中，COSFormer表现优于现有持续学习框架，具有更强的泛化能力和有效性。

Conclusion: COSFormer是临床应用中持续WSI分析的强大解决方案。

Abstract: Whole Slide Image (WSI) analysis, with its ability to reveal detailed tissue
structures in magnified views, plays a crucial role in cancer diagnosis and
prognosis. Due to their giga-sized nature, WSIs require substantial storage and
computational resources for processing and training predictive models. With the
rapid increase in WSIs used in clinics and hospitals, there is a growing need
for a continual learning system that can efficiently process and adapt existing
models to new tasks without retraining or fine-tuning on previous tasks. Such a
system must balance resource efficiency with high performance. In this study,
we introduce COSFormer, a Transformer-based continual learning framework
tailored for multi-task WSI analysis. COSFormer is designed to learn
sequentially from new tasks wile avoiding the need to revisit full historical
datasets. We evaluate COSFormer on a sequence of seven WSI datasets covering
seven organs and six WSI-related tasks under both class-incremental and
task-incremental settings. The results demonstrate COSFormer's superior
generalizability and effectiveness compared to existing continual learning
frameworks, establishing it as a robust solution for continual WSI analysis in
clinical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机具有高动态范围和高时间分辨率等优势，但如何从异步事件流中提取有效信息并实现实时处理是挑战。

Method: 通过单次积分事件流并结合增强衰减算法，实现实时强度图像重建。

Result: ESI在运行效率、重建质量和帧率上优于现有算法，适用于低光照条件下的无人机视觉跟踪。

Conclusion: ESI显著提升了无人机在视觉恶劣环境下的感知能力，尤其在极低光照条件下表现优异。

Abstract: Event cameras offer significant advantages, including a wide dynamic range,
high temporal resolution, and immunity to motion blur, making them highly
promising for addressing challenging visual conditions. Extracting and
utilizing effective information from asynchronous event streams is essential
for the onboard implementation of event cameras. In this paper, we propose a
streamlined event-based intensity reconstruction scheme, event-based single
integration (ESI), to address such implementation challenges. This method
guarantees the portability of conventional frame-based vision methods to
event-based scenarios and maintains the intrinsic advantages of event cameras.
The ESI approach reconstructs intensity images by performing a single
integration of the event streams combined with an enhanced decay algorithm.
Such a method enables real-time intensity reconstruction at a high frame rate,
typically 100 FPS. Furthermore, the relatively low computation load of ESI fits
onboard implementation suitably, such as in UAV-based visual tracking
scenarios. Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the
performance comparison of ESI and state-of-the-art algorithms. Compared to
state-of-the-art algorithms, ESI demonstrates remarkable runtime efficiency
improvements, superior reconstruction quality, and a high frame rate. As a
result, ESI enhances UAV onboard perception significantly under visual
adversary surroundings. In-flight tests, ESI demonstrates effective performance
for UAV onboard visual tracking under extremely low illumination
conditions(2-10lux), whereas other comparative algorithms fail due to
insufficient frame rate, poor image quality, or limited real-time performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs)在视觉生成任务中表现优异，但推理速度慢限制了其在低资源应用中的部署。现有方法存在内存和计算开销大、固定缓存调度导致输出质量下降的问题。

Method: 将泰勒预测目标从模块级转移到最后一个块级，减少缓存特征数量；利用第一个块的预测误差动态调整缓存机制，仅在预测可靠时使用泰勒预测，否则回退到完整计算。

Result: 在FLUX、DiT和Wan Video上分别实现了3.17x、2.36x和4.14x的加速，且生成质量几乎无下降。

Conclusion: 该方法在速度和生成质量之间取得了更好的平衡，为DiTs的加速提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
visual generation tasks. However, their low inference speed limits their
deployment in low-resource applications. Recent training-free approaches
exploit the redundancy of features across timesteps by caching and reusing past
representations to accelerate inference. Building on this idea, TaylorSeer
instead uses cached features to predict future ones via Taylor expansion.
However, its module-level prediction across all transformer blocks (e.g.,
attention or feedforward modules) requires storing fine-grained intermediate
features, leading to notable memory and computation overhead. Moreover, it
adopts a fixed caching schedule without considering the varying accuracy of
predictions across timesteps, which can lead to degraded outputs when
prediction fails. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach to
better leverage Taylor-based acceleration. First, we shift the Taylor
prediction target from the module level to the last block level, significantly
reducing the number of cached features. Furthermore, observing strong
sequential dependencies among Transformer blocks, we propose to use the error
between the Taylor-estimated and actual outputs of the first block as an
indicator of prediction reliability. If the error is small, we trust the Taylor
prediction for the last block; otherwise, we fall back to full computation,
thereby enabling a dynamic caching mechanism. Empirical results show that our
method achieves a better balance between speed and quality, achieving a 3.17x
acceleration on FLUX, 2.36x on DiT, and 4.14x on Wan Video with negligible
quality drop. The Project Page is

Result: 在三个公开数据集上，性能分别提升3.2%、5.1%和1.6%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: I2CR框架通过文本优先和视觉补充策略，有效提升了多模态实体链接的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multimodal entity linking plays a crucial role in a wide range of
applications. Recent advances in large language model-based methods have become
the dominant paradigm for this task, effectively leveraging both textual and
visual modalities to enhance performance. Despite their success, these methods
still face two challenges, including unnecessary incorporation of image data in
certain scenarios and the reliance only on a one-time extraction of visual
features, which can undermine their effectiveness and accuracy. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel LLM-based framework for the multimodal
entity linking task, called Intra- and Inter-modal Collaborative Reflections.
This framework prioritizes leveraging text information to address the task.
When text alone is insufficient to link the correct entity through intra- and
inter-modality evaluations, it employs a multi-round iterative strategy that
integrates key visual clues from various aspects of the image to support
reasoning and enhance matching accuracy. Extensive experiments on three widely
used public datasets demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms
current state-of-the-art methods in the task, achieving improvements of 3.2%,
5.1%, and 1.6%, respectively. Our code is available at

Method: 采用导数标签传播方法，对像素级特征向量施加离散导数操作作为正则化，生成严格正则化的相似性度量。

Result: 实验验证了设计的合理性，并展示了优于其他方法的性能。

Conclusion: DerProp通过导数标签传播有效解决了伪标签不可靠的问题，提升了半监督语义分割的性能。

Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation, which leverages a limited set of
labeled images, helps to relieve the heavy annotation burden. While
pseudo-labeling strategies yield promising results, there is still room for
enhancing the reliability of pseudo-labels. Hence, we develop a semi-supervised
framework, namely DerProp, equipped with a novel derivative label propagation
to rectify imperfect pseudo-labels. Our label propagation method imposes
discrete derivative operations on pixel-wise feature vectors as additional
regularization, thereby generating strictly regularized similarity metrics.
Doing so effectively alleviates the ill-posed problem that identical
similarities correspond to different features, through constraining the
solution space. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the rationality
of our design, and demonstrate our superiority over other methods. Codes are
available at https://github.com/ForawardStar/DerProp/.

Conclusion: Patho-AgenticRAG通过多模态检索和推理能力，有效解决了病理学VLMs的幻觉问题，提升了诊断准确性。

Abstract: Although Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong generalization in
medical imaging, pathology presents unique challenges due to ultra-high
resolution, complex tissue structures, and nuanced clinical semantics. These
factors make pathology VLMs prone to hallucinations, i.e., generating outputs
inconsistent with visual evidence, which undermines clinical trust. Existing
RAG approaches in this domain largely depend on text-based knowledge bases,
limiting their ability to leverage diagnostic visual cues. To address this, we
propose Patho-AgenticRAG, a multimodal RAG framework with a database built on
page-level embeddings from authoritative pathology textbooks. Unlike
traditional text-only retrieval systems, it supports joint text-image search,
enabling direct retrieval of textbook pages that contain both the queried text
and relevant visual cues, thus avoiding the loss of critical image-based
information. Patho-AgenticRAG also supports reasoning, task decomposition, and
multi-turn search interactions, improving accuracy in complex diagnostic
scenarios. Experiments show that Patho-AgenticRAG significantly outperforms
existing multimodal models in complex pathology tasks like multiple-choice
diagnosis and visual question answering. Our project is available at the

Conclusion: SplatSSC通过深度引导和高效聚合策略，实现了更优的性能和效率。

Abstract: Monocular 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) is a challenging yet promising
task that aims to infer dense geometric and semantic descriptions of a scene
from a single image. While recent object-centric paradigms significantly
improve efficiency by leveraging flexible 3D Gaussian primitives, they still
rely heavily on a large number of randomly initialized primitives, which
inevitably leads to 1) inefficient primitive initialization and 2) outlier
primitives that introduce erroneous artifacts. In this paper, we propose
SplatSSC, a novel framework that resolves these limitations with a depth-guided
initialization strategy and a principled Gaussian aggregator. Instead of random
initialization, SplatSSC utilizes a dedicated depth branch composed of a
Group-wise Multi-scale Fusion (GMF) module, which integrates multi-scale image
and depth features to generate a sparse yet representative set of initial
Gaussian primitives. To mitigate noise from outlier primitives, we develop the
Decoupled Gaussian Aggregator (DGA), which enhances robustness by decomposing
geometric and semantic predictions during the Gaussian-to-voxel splatting
process. Complemented with a specialized Probability Scale Loss, our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Occ-ScanNet dataset, outperforming
prior approaches by over 6.3% in IoU and 4.1% in mIoU, while reducing both
latency and memory consumption by more than 9.3%. The code will be released
upon acceptance.

Conclusion: Hermes通过整合任务间信息和优化伪标签选择，显著提升了半监督对比学习的性能。

Abstract: Confidence-based pseudo-label selection usually generates overly confident
yet incorrect predictions, due to the early misleadingness of model and
overfitting inaccurate pseudo-labels in the learning process, which heavily
degrades the performance of semi-supervised contrastive learning. Moreover,
segmentation and classification tasks are treated independently and the
affinity fails to be fully explored. To address these issues, we propose a
novel semi-supervised dual-threshold contrastive learning strategy for
ultrasound image classification and segmentation, named Hermes. This strategy
combines the strengths of contrastive learning with semi-supervised learning,
where the pseudo-labels assist contrastive learning by providing additional
guidance. Specifically, an inter-task attention and saliency module is also
developed to facilitate information sharing between the segmentation and
classification tasks. Furthermore, an inter-task consistency learning strategy
is designed to align tumor features across both tasks, avoiding negative
transfer for reducing features discrepancy. To solve the lack of publicly
available ultrasound datasets, we have collected the SZ-TUS dataset, a thyroid
ultrasound image dataset. Extensive experiments on two public ultrasound
datasets and one private dataset demonstrate that Hermes consistently
outperforms several state-of-the-art methods across various semi-supervised
settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SGAD提出了一种新的语义和几何感知描述符网络，通过直接匹配高效解决局部特征匹配问题，显著提升了准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于A2PM的方法依赖低效的像素级比较和复杂图匹配，限制了可扩展性。

Method: SGAD生成高区分度的区域描述符，避免复杂图优化；采用分类和排序子任务监督策略；引入HCRF过滤重叠区域。

Result: SGAD将运行时间减少60倍（0.82s vs. 60.23s），在户外和室内姿态估计中均实现更高精度和效率。

Conclusion: SGAD通过创新设计和监督策略，显著提升了区域匹配性能，成为新的SOTA方法。

Abstract: Local feature matching remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision.
Recent Area to Point Matching (A2PM) methods have improved matching accuracy.
However, existing research based on this framework relies on inefficient
pixel-level comparisons and complex graph matching that limit scalability. In
this work, we introduce the Semantic and Geometric-aware Descriptor Network
(SGAD), which fundamentally rethinks area-based matching by generating highly
discriminative area descriptors that enable direct matching without complex
graph optimization. This approach significantly improves both accuracy and
efficiency of area matching. We further improve the performance of area
matching through a novel supervision strategy that decomposes the area matching
task into classification and ranking subtasks. Finally, we introduce the
Hierarchical Containment Redundancy Filter (HCRF) to eliminate overlapping
areas by analyzing containment graphs. SGAD demonstrates remarkable performance
gains, reducing runtime by 60x (0.82s vs. 60.23s) compared to MESA. Extensive
evaluations show consistent improvements across multiple point matchers:
SGAD+LoFTR reduces runtime compared to DKM, while achieving higher accuracy
(0.82s vs. 1.51s, 65.98 vs. 61.11) in outdoor pose estimation, and SGAD+ROMA
delivers +7.39% AUC@5{\deg} in indoor pose estimation, establishing a new
state-of-the-art.

<details>

Motivation: 医学图像分割对疾病诊断和治疗规划至关重要，但现有方法在跨模态分割性能上仍有提升空间，尤其是边缘信息在预训练中的作用尚未系统研究。

Method: 通过使用Kirsch等边缘核处理数据预训练基础模型，并在多种医学成像模态上微调，结合元学习策略选择最优预训练方法。

Result: 实验表明，边缘增强预训练在某些模态上提升性能，而在其他模态上降低性能，元学习策略整体提升了16.42%-19.30%的分割性能。

Conclusion: 选择性应用边缘增强预训练并结合元学习策略可显著提升跨模态医学图像分割性能。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for disease diagnosis and treatment
planning, yet developing robust segmentation models often requires substantial
computational resources and large datasets. Existing research shows that
pre-trained and finetuned foundation models can boost segmentation performance.
However, questions remain about how particular image preprocessing steps may
influence segmentation performance across different medical imaging modalities.
In particular, edges-abrupt transitions in pixel intensity-are widely
acknowledged as vital cues for object boundaries but have not been
systematically examined in the pre-training of foundation models. We address
this gap by investigating to which extend pre-training with data processed
using computationally efficient edge kernels, such as kirsch, can improve
cross-modality segmentation capabilities of a foundation model. Two versions of
a foundation model are first trained on either raw or edge-enhanced data across
multiple medical imaging modalities, then finetuned on selected raw subsets
tailored to specific medical modalities. After systematic investigation using
the medical domains Dermoscopy, Fundus, Mammography, Microscopy, OCT, US, and
XRay, we discover both increased and reduced segmentation performance across
modalities using edge-focused pre-training, indicating the need for a selective
application of this approach. To guide such selective applications, we propose
a meta-learning strategy. It uses standard deviation and image entropy of the
raw image to choose between a model pre-trained on edge-enhanced or on raw data
for optimal performance. Our experiments show that integrating this
meta-learning layer yields an overall segmentation performance improvement
across diverse medical imaging tasks by 16.42% compared to models pre-trained
on edge-enhanced data only and 19.30% compared to models pre-trained on raw
data only.

TL;DR: 提出了一种仅依赖事件相机的立体3D物体检测框架，通过双滤波器机制提取语义和几何信息，并在动态环境中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LiDAR和RGB相机在高动态场景中存在感知间隙，而事件相机的高时间分辨率可提供连续运动捕捉，但现有方法依赖同步传感器限制了性能。

Method: 设计了一种仅使用事件相机的立体3D检测框架，引入双滤波器提取语义和几何信息，并通过目标中心信息对齐边界框以增强回归。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在动态环境中优于现有方法，验证了事件相机在连续时间3D感知中的潜力。

Conclusion: 事件相机可独立用于高效3D物体检测，尤其在高速动态场景中表现优异。

Abstract: 3D object detection is essential for autonomous systems, enabling precise
localization and dimension estimation. While LiDAR and RGB cameras are widely
used, their fixed frame rates create perception gaps in high-speed scenarios.
Event cameras, with their asynchronous nature and high temporal resolution,
offer a solution by capturing motion continuously. The recent approach, which
integrates event cameras with conventional sensors for continuous-time
detection, struggles in fast-motion scenarios due to its dependency on
synchronized sensors. We propose a novel stereo 3D object detection framework
that relies solely on event cameras, eliminating the need for conventional 3D
sensors. To compensate for the lack of semantic and geometric information in
event data, we introduce a dual filter mechanism that extracts both.
Additionally, we enhance regression by aligning bounding boxes with
object-centric information. Experiments show that our method outperforms prior
approaches in dynamic environments, demonstrating the potential of event
cameras for robust, continuous-time 3D perception. The code is available at

TL;DR: CoMet是一种新的训练策略，通过结合Soft Confident Learning和Meta-Learning，使异常检测模型能够从未经筛选的数据中学习，无需手动过滤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统无监督异常检测假设所有训练数据均为正常样本，需手动筛选数据，引入偏差且适应性差。

Method: CoMet结合Soft Confident Learning（降低低置信度样本权重）和Meta-Learning（通过训练验证损失协方差正则化更新），防止过拟合并增强对噪声数据的鲁棒性。

Result: 在多个数据集上，CoMet优于基线方法，对训练集中的异常不敏感，并在所有数据集上达到新的最优性能。

Conclusion: CoMet是一种模型无关的方法，可应用于任何基于梯度下降的异常检测模型，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: So-called unsupervised anomaly detection is better described as
semi-supervised, as it assumes all training data are nominal. This assumption
simplifies training but requires manual data curation, introducing bias and
limiting adaptability. We propose Confident Meta-learning (CoMet), a novel
training strategy that enables deep anomaly detection models to learn from
uncurated datasets where nominal and anomalous samples coexist, eliminating the
need for explicit filtering. Our approach integrates Soft Confident Learning,
which assigns lower weights to low-confidence samples, and Meta-Learning, which
stabilizes training by regularizing updates based on training validation loss
covariance. This prevents overfitting and enhances robustness to noisy data.
CoMet is model-agnostic and can be applied to any anomaly detection method
trainable via gradient descent. Experiments on MVTec-AD, VIADUCT, and KSDD2
with two state-of-the-art models demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,
consistently improving over the baseline methods, remaining insensitive to
anomalies in the training set, and setting a new state-of-the-art across all
datasets.

Abstract: Reliable preclinical disease risk assessment is essential to move public
healthcare from reactive treatment to proactive identification and prevention.
However, image-based risk prediction algorithms often consider one condition at
a time and depend on hand-crafted features obtained through segmentation tools.
We propose a whole-body self-supervised representation learning method for the
preclinical disease risk assessment under a competing risk modeling. This
approach outperforms whole-body radiomics in multiple diseases, including
cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes (T2D), chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Simulating a
preclinical screening scenario and subsequently combining with cardiac MRI, it
sharpens further the prediction for CVD subgroups: ischemic heart disease
(IHD), hypertensive diseases (HD), and stroke. The results indicate the
translational potential of whole-body representations as a standalone screening
modality and as part of a multi-modal framework within clinical workflows for
early personalized risk stratification. The code is available at

Motivation: AI在医疗中的潜在应用需要确保安全性，尤其是在模型可能误分类时延迟决策。研究比较了两种方法在数据偏移情况下的表现。

Method: 构建了一个大规模眼科数据集评估学习延迟模型和不确定性量化方法，分析它们在分布内外对青光眼分类的表现。

Result: 不确定性量化方法在分布外数据上表现更稳健，可能更适合作为AI延迟决策的策略。

Conclusion: 不确定性量化方法在AI延迟决策中更具潜力，尤其是在面对分布外数据时。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds the potential to dramatically improve
patient care. However, it is not infallible, necessitating
human-AI-collaboration to ensure safe implementation. One aspect of AI safety
is the models' ability to defer decisions to a human expert when they are
likely to misclassify autonomously. Recent research has focused on methods that
learn to defer by optimising a surrogate loss function that finds the optimal
trade-off between predicting a class label or deferring. However, during
clinical translation, models often face challenges such as data shift.
Uncertainty quantification methods aim to estimate a model's confidence in its
predictions. However, they may also be used as a deferral strategy which does
not rely on learning from specific training distribution. We hypothesise that
models developed to quantify uncertainty are more robust to out-of-distribution
(OOD) input than learned deferral models that have been trained in a supervised
fashion. To investigate this hypothesis, we constructed an extensive evaluation
study on a large ophthalmology dataset, examining both learned deferral models
and established uncertainty quantification methods, assessing their performance
in- and out-of-distribution. Specifically, we evaluate their ability to
accurately classify glaucoma from fundus images while deferring cases with a
high likelihood of error. We find that uncertainty quantification methods may
be a promising choice for AI deferral.

Conclusion: 逻辑驱动的约束有效提升了零样本组合动作识别的性能。

Abstract: Zero-shot compositional action recognition (ZS-CAR) aims to identify unseen
verb-object compositions in the videos by exploiting the learned knowledge of
verb and object primitives during training. Despite compositional learning's
progress in ZS-CAR, two critical challenges persist: 1) Missing compositional
structure constraint, leading to spurious correlations between primitives; 2)
Neglecting semantic hierarchy constraint, leading to semantic ambiguity and
impairing the training process. In this paper, we argue that human-like
symbolic reasoning offers a principled solution to these challenges by
explicitly modeling compositional and hierarchical structured abstraction. To
this end, we propose a logic-driven ZS-CAR framework LogicCAR that integrates
dual symbolic constraints: Explicit Compositional Logic and Hierarchical
Primitive Logic. Specifically, the former models the restrictions within the
compositions, enhancing the compositional reasoning ability of our model. The
latter investigates the semantical dependencies among different primitives,
empowering the models with fine-to-coarse reasoning capacity. By formalizing
these constraints in first-order logic and embedding them into neural network
architectures, LogicCAR systematically bridges the gap between symbolic
abstraction and existing models. Extensive experiments on the Sth-com dataset
demonstrate that our LogicCAR outperforms existing baseline methods, proving
the effectiveness of our logic-driven constraints.

Abstract: Volumetric scene reconstruction from a single image is crucial for a broad

state-of-the-art baselines that use multi-view supervision, and offers unique
advantages, for example regarding dynamic scenes.

Conclusion: Qwen-Image在复杂文本渲染和图像编辑方面具有显著优势，为多语言和多任务场景提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We present Qwen-Image, an image generation foundation model in the Qwen
series that achieves significant advances in complex text rendering and precise
image editing. To address the challenges of complex text rendering, we design a
comprehensive data pipeline that includes large-scale data collection,
filtering, annotation, synthesis, and balancing. Moreover, we adopt a
progressive training strategy that starts with non-text-to-text rendering,
evolves from simple to complex textual inputs, and gradually scales up to
paragraph-level descriptions. This curriculum learning approach substantially
enhances the model's native text rendering capabilities. As a result,
Qwen-Image not only performs exceptionally well in alphabetic languages such as
English, but also achieves remarkable progress on more challenging logographic
languages like Chinese. To enhance image editing consistency, we introduce an
improved multi-task training paradigm that incorporates not only traditional
text-to-image (T2I) and text-image-to-image (TI2I) tasks but also
image-to-image (I2I) reconstruction, effectively aligning the latent
representations between Qwen2.5-VL and MMDiT. Furthermore, we separately feed
the original image into Qwen2.5-VL and the VAE encoder to obtain semantic and
reconstructive representations, respectively. This dual-encoding mechanism
enables the editing module to strike a balance between preserving semantic
consistency and maintaining visual fidelity. Qwen-Image achieves
state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating its strong capabilities in both
image generation and editing across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Despite the success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP in aligning
vision and language, their proficiency in detailed, fine-grained visual
comprehension remains a key challenge. We present CLIP-IN, a novel framework
that bolsters CLIP's fine-grained perception through two core innovations.
Firstly, we leverage instruction-editing datasets, originally designed for
image manipulation, as a unique source of hard negative image-text pairs.
Coupled with a symmetric hard negative contrastive loss, this enables the model
to effectively distinguish subtle visual-semantic differences. Secondly,
CLIP-IN incorporates long descriptive captions, utilizing rotary positional
encodings to capture rich semantic context often missed by standard CLIP. Our
experiments demonstrate that CLIP-IN achieves substantial gains on the MMVP
benchmark and various fine-grained visual recognition tasks, without
compromising robust zero-shot performance on broader classification and
retrieval tasks. Critically, integrating CLIP-IN's visual representations into
Multimodal Large Language Models significantly reduces visual hallucinations
and enhances reasoning abilities. This work underscores the considerable
potential of synergizing targeted, instruction-based contrastive learning with
comprehensive descriptive information to elevate the fine-grained understanding
of VLMs.

Result: 在球面域和无对应关系设置下，算法比现有方法快10倍且准确10倍。

Conclusion: 该方法在模拟和实际任务（点云配准和球面图像旋转估计）中均表现出色。

Abstract: Existing methods for rotation estimation between two spherical
($\mathbb{S}^2$) patterns typically rely on spherical cross-correlation
maximization between two spherical function. However, these approaches exhibit
computational complexities greater than cubic $O(n^3)$ with respect to rotation
space discretization and lack extensive evaluation under significant outlier
contamination. To this end, we propose a rotation estimation algorithm between
two spherical patterns with linear time complexity $O(n)$. Unlike existing
spherical-function-based methods, we explicitly represent spherical patterns as
discrete 3D point sets on the unit sphere, reformulating rotation estimation as
a spherical point-set alignment (i.e., Wahba problem for 3D unit vectors).
Given the geometric nature of our formulation, our spherical pattern alignment
algorithm naturally aligns with the Wahba problem framework for 3D unit
vectors. Specifically, we introduce three novel algorithms: (1) SPMC (Spherical
Pattern Matching by Correlation), (2) FRS (Fast Rotation Search), and (3) a
hybrid approach (SPMC+FRS) that combines the advantages of the previous two
methods. Our experiments demonstrate that in the $\mathbb{S}^2$ domain and in
correspondence-free settings, our algorithms are over 10x faster and over 10x
more accurate than current state-of-the-art methods for the Wahba problem with
outliers. We validate our approach through extensive simulations on a new
dataset of spherical patterns, the ``Robust Vector Alignment Dataset.
"Furthermore, we adapt our methods to two real-world tasks: (i) Point Cloud
Registration (PCR) and (ii) rotation estimation for spherical images.

Conclusion: LPD通过多样化空间和损失设计，显著提升了视频搜索的多样性和准确性。

Abstract: Ad-hoc Video Search (AVS) involves using a textual query to search for
multiple relevant videos in a large collection of unlabeled short videos. The
main challenge of AVS is the visual diversity of relevant videos. A simple
query such as "Find shots of a man and a woman dancing together indoors" can
span a multitude of environments, from brightly lit halls and shadowy bars to
dance scenes in black-and-white animations. It is therefore essential to
retrieve relevant videos as comprehensively as possible. Current solutions for
the AVS task primarily fuse multiple features into one or more common spaces,
yet overlook the need for diverse spaces. To fully exploit the expressive
capability of individual features, we propose LPD, short for Learning Partially
Decorrelated common spaces. LPD incorporates two key innovations:
feature-specific common space construction and the de-correlation loss.
Specifically, LPD learns a separate common space for each video and text
feature, and employs de-correlation loss to diversify the ordering of negative
samples across different spaces. To enhance the consistency of multi-space
convergence, we designed an entropy-based fair multi-space triplet ranking
loss. Extensive experiments on the TRECVID AVS benchmarks (2016-2023) justify
the effectiveness of LPD. Moreover, diversity visualizations of LPD's spaces
highlight its ability to enhance result diversity.

Abstract: Pedestrians Localization in Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) regions within urban
environments poses a significant challenge for autonomous driving systems.
While mmWave radar has demonstrated potential for detecting objects in such
scenarios, the 2D radar point cloud (PCD) data is susceptible to distortions
caused by multipath reflections, making accurate spatial inference difficult.
Additionally, although camera images provide high-resolution visual
information, they lack depth perception and cannot directly observe objects in
NLoS regions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that interprets radar
PCD through road layout inferred from camera for localization of NLoS
pedestrians. The proposed method leverages visual information from the camera
to interpret 2D radar PCD, enabling spatial scene reconstruction. The
effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through experiments
conducted using a radar-camera system mounted on a real vehicle. The
localization performance is evaluated using a dataset collected in outdoor NLoS
driving environments, demonstrating the practical applicability of the method.

Abstract: Generating semantically coherent and visually accurate talking faces requires
bridging the gap between linguistic meaning and facial articulation. Although
audio-driven methods remain prevalent, their reliance on high-quality paired
audio visual data and the inherent ambiguity in mapping acoustics to lip motion
pose significant challenges in terms of scalability and robustness. To address
these issues, we propose Text2Lip, a viseme-centric framework that constructs
an interpretable phonetic-visual bridge by embedding textual input into
structured viseme sequences. These mid-level units serve as a linguistically
grounded prior for lip motion prediction. Furthermore, we design a progressive
viseme-audio replacement strategy based on curriculum learning, enabling the
model to gradually transition from real audio to pseudo-audio reconstructed
from enhanced viseme features via cross-modal attention. This allows for robust
generation in both audio-present and audio-free scenarios. Finally, a
landmark-guided renderer synthesizes photorealistic facial videos with accurate
lip synchronization. Extensive evaluations show that Text2Lip outperforms
existing approaches in semantic fidelity, visual realism, and modality
robustness, establishing a new paradigm for controllable and flexible talking
face generation. Our project homepage is https://plyon1.github.io/Text2Lip/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图像反演中重建保真度和编辑灵活性之间的平衡问题。

Method: 通过最优传输理论指导反向扩散过程，计算图像和噪声分布之间的最优传输路径。

Result: 在多个编辑任务中表现优异，LPIPS和SSIM分数显著优于现有方法，重建损失和身份保持均有提升。

Conclusion: OTIP在保持计算效率的同时，实现了高质量重建和编辑控制，适用于多样化编辑场景。

Abstract: Effective image inversion in rectified flow models - mapping real images to
editable latent representations - is crucial for practical image editing
applications; however, achieving optimal balance between reconstruction
fidelity and editing flexibility remains a fundamental challenge. In this work,
we introduce the Optimal Transport Inversion Pipeline (OTIP), a zero-shot
framework that leverages optimal transport theory to guide the inversion
process in rectified flow models. Our underlying hypothesis is that
incorporating transport-based guidance during the reverse diffusion process can
effectively balance reconstruction accuracy and editing controllability through
principled trajectory optimization. The method computes optimal transport paths
between image and noise distributions while maintaining computational
efficiency. Our approach achieves high-fidelity reconstruction with LPIPS
scores of 0.001 and SSIM of 0.992 on face editing benchmarks, demonstrating
superior preservation of fine-grained details compared to existing methods. We
evaluate the framework across multiple editing tasks, observing 7.8% to 12.9%
improvements in reconstruction loss over RF-Inversion on the LSUN-Bedroom and
LSUN-Church datasets, respectively. For semantic face editing, our method
achieves an 11.2% improvement in identity preservation and a 1.6% enhancement
in perceptual quality, while maintaining computational efficiency comparable to
baseline approaches. Qualitatively, our method produces visually compelling
edits with superior semantic consistency and fine-grained detail preservation
across diverse editing scenarios. Code is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了TRUDI数据集和TITUS管道，用于识别港口物流中的运输单元（TUs），解决了缺乏公开基准数据集的问题，并在多样环境下验证了其可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 港口物流中运输单元的识别效率提升受限于缺乏公开且多样化的数据集，因此需要填补这一空白。

Method: 提出了TRUDI数据集（35,034个标注实例）和TITUS管道（三阶段：分割、ID文本定位、识别与验证）。

Result: TITUS在不同视角、光照和天气条件下可靠识别运输单元，优于依赖特定场景的系统。

Conclusion: TRUDI数据集和TITUS管道为港口数字化转型提供了基准工具，提升了物流链效率。

Abstract: Identifying transportation units (TUs) is essential for improving the
efficiency of port logistics. However, progress in this field has been hindered
by the lack of publicly available benchmark datasets that capture the diversity
and dynamics of real-world port environments. To address this gap, we present
the TRUDI dataset-a comprehensive collection comprising 35,034 annotated
instances across five categories: container, tank container, trailer, ID text,
and logo. The images were captured at operational ports using both ground-based
and aerial cameras, under a wide variety of lighting and weather conditions.
For the identification of TUs-which involves reading the 11-digit alphanumeric
ID typically painted on each unit-we introduce TITUS, a dedicated pipeline that
operates in three stages: (1) segmenting the TU instances, (2) detecting the
location of the ID text, and (3) recognising and validating the extracted ID.
Unlike alternative systems, which often require similar scenes, specific camera
angles or gate setups, our evaluation demonstrates that TITUS reliably
identifies TUs from a range of camera perspectives and in varying lighting and
weather conditions. By making the TRUDI dataset publicly available, we provide
a robust benchmark that enables the development and comparison of new
approaches. This contribution supports digital transformation efforts in
multipurpose ports and helps to increase the efficiency of entire logistics
chains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前布局生成方法存在任务特定性和评估指标不匹配的问题，限制了其应用和效果。

Method: 通过统一分类和自然语言提示实现通用生成；构建大规模人类反馈数据集Layout-HF100k；结合视觉和几何信息设计评估器；采用动态优化方法DMPO对齐生成器和评估器。

Result: Uni-Layout在实验中显著优于任务特定和通用方法。

Conclusion: Uni-Layout通过统一生成和评估框架，结合人类反馈和动态优化，提升了布局生成的适用性和效果。

Abstract: Layout generation plays a crucial role in enhancing both user experience and
design efficiency. However, current approaches suffer from task-specific
generation capabilities and perceptually misaligned evaluation metrics, leading
to limited applicability and ineffective measurement. In this paper, we propose
\textit{Uni-Layout}, a novel framework that achieves unified generation,
human-mimicking evaluation and alignment between the two. For universal
generation, we incorporate various layout tasks into a single taxonomy and
develop a unified generator that handles background or element contents
constrained tasks via natural language prompts. To introduce human feedback for
the effective evaluation of layouts, we build \textit{Layout-HF100k}, the first
large-scale human feedback dataset with 100,000 expertly annotated layouts.
Based on \textit{Layout-HF100k}, we introduce a human-mimicking evaluator that
integrates visual and geometric information, employing a Chain-of-Thought
mechanism to conduct qualitative assessments alongside a confidence estimation
module to yield quantitative measurements. For better alignment between the
generator and the evaluator, we integrate them into a cohesive system by
adopting Dynamic-Margin Preference Optimization (DMPO), which dynamically
adjusts margins based on preference strength to better align with human
judgments. Extensive experiments show that \textit{Uni-Layout} significantly
outperforms both task-specific and general-purpose methods. Our code is
publicly available at https://github.com/JD-GenX/Uni-Layout.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多尺度目标和动态环境下的海上监视挑战，填补多模态遥感数据的空白。

Method: 构建包含1092组多模态图像的数据集，每组合五种模态图像，并进行精细标注和时空一致性注册。

Result: 数据集覆盖38,838艘船只，支持多种任务，实验验证其有效性。

Conclusion: SMART-Ship数据集能支持多模态遥感任务，并为未来研究提供方向。

Abstract: Given the limitations of satellite orbits and imaging conditions, multi-modal
remote sensing (RS) data is crucial in enabling long-term earth observation.
However, maritime surveillance remains challenging due to the complexity of
multi-scale targets and the dynamic environments. To bridge this critical gap,
we propose a Synchronized Multi-modal Aligned Remote sensing Targets dataset
for berthed ships analysis (SMART-Ship), containing spatiotemporal registered
images with fine-grained annotation for maritime targets from five modalities:
visible-light, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), panchromatic, multi-spectral,
and near-infrared. Specifically, our dataset consists of 1092 multi-modal image
sets, covering 38,838 ships. Each image set is acquired within one week and
registered to ensure spatiotemporal consistency. Ship instances in each set are
annotated with polygonal location information, fine-grained categories,
instance-level identifiers, and change region masks, organized hierarchically
to support diverse multi-modal RS tasks. Furthermore, we define standardized
benchmarks on five fundamental tasks and comprehensively compare representative
methods across the dataset. Thorough experiment evaluations validate that the
proposed SMART-Ship dataset could support various multi-modal RS interpretation
tasks and reveal the promising directions for further exploration.

*Xingyu Feng,Hebei Gao,Hong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COLER是一种无监督实例分割和目标检测方法，通过CutOnce生成粗伪标签，并结合自训练提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无监督实例分割和目标检测中伪标签生成和性能提升的问题。

Method: 使用CutOnce一次性生成多对象掩码，结合自训练优化检测器。

Result: 在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: COLER推动了无监督目标定位领域的发展。

Abstract: We propose Cut-Once-and-LEaRn (COLER), a simple approach for unsupervised
instance segmentation and object detection. COLER first uses our developed
CutOnce to generate coarse pseudo labels, then enables the detector to learn
from these masks. CutOnce applies Normalized Cut only once and does not rely on
any clustering methods, but it can generate multiple object masks in an image.
We have designed several novel yet simple modules that not only allow CutOnce
to fully leverage the object discovery capabilities of self-supervised models,
but also free it from reliance on mask post-processing. During training, COLER
achieves strong performance without requiring specially designed loss functions
for pseudo labels, and its performance is further improved through
self-training. COLER is a zero-shot unsupervised model that outperforms
previous state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmarks.We believe our method
can help advance the field of unsupervised object localization.

### [208] [Hydra: Accurate Multi-Modal Leaf Wetness Sensing with mm-Wave and Camera Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02409)
*Yimeng Liu,Maolin Gan,Huaili Zeng,Li Liu,Younsuk Dong,Zhichao Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合毫米波雷达和摄像头技术的创新方法Hydra，用于检测叶片湿润持续时间（LWD），并在不同环境下实现了高精度分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LWD检测方法缺乏标准化技术，且对不同植物特性和环境条件的适应性不足，导致精度和鲁棒性较低。

Method: 结合毫米波雷达和摄像头技术，设计CNN融合多深度图像与RGB图像，再通过基于Transformer的编码器生成特征图，最后用分类器检测叶片湿润状态。

Result: Hydra在多种场景下分类叶片湿润的准确率高达96%，在农场实际部署中（如雨天或光线不足的夜晚）仍保持约90%的准确率。

Conclusion: Hydra方法显著提升了LWD检测的精度和鲁棒性，适用于实际农业环境。

Abstract: Leaf Wetness Duration (LWD), the time that water remains on leaf surfaces, is
crucial in the development of plant diseases. Existing LWD detection lacks
standardized measurement techniques, and variations across different plant
characteristics limit its effectiveness. Prior research proposes diverse
approaches, but they fail to measure real natural leaves directly and lack
resilience in various environmental conditions. This reduces the precision and
robustness, revealing a notable practical application and effectiveness gap in
real-world agricultural settings. This paper presents Hydra, an innovative
approach that integrates millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) radar with camera technology
to detect leaf wetness by determining if there is water on the leaf. We can
measure the time to determine the LWD based on this detection. Firstly, we
design a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to selectively fuse multiple
mm-Wave depth images with an RGB image to generate multiple feature images.
Then, we develop a transformer-based encoder to capture the inherent connection
among the multiple feature images to generate a feature map, which is further
fed to a classifier for detection. Moreover, we augment the dataset during
training to generalize our model. Implemented using a frequency-modulated
continuous-wave (FMCW) radar within the 76 to 81 GHz band, Hydra's performance
is meticulously evaluated on plants, demonstrating the potential to classify
leaf wetness with up to 96% accuracy across varying scenarios. Deploying Hydra
in the farm, including rainy, dawn, or poorly light nights, it still achieves
an accuracy rate of around 90%.

Motivation: 多变量时间序列分析因高维性和复杂变量交互而具有挑战性，超图的结构建模能力为此提供了灵感。

Method: 通过归一化和嵌入将时间序列信号转换为令牌，利用多头自注意力增强时序表示，构建分层超图聚合时序模式和变量关系，并通过EdgeToNode模块和前馈网络增强特征。

Result: 在两项多变量时间序列任务和八个数据集上的实验验证了HGTS-Former的有效性。

Conclusion: HGTS-Former为解决多变量时间序列的复杂耦合问题提供了有效方法，代码将开源。

Abstract: Multivariate time series analysis has long been one of the key research
topics in the field of artificial intelligence. However, analyzing complex time
series data remains a challenging and unresolved problem due to its high
dimensionality, dynamic nature, and complex interactions among variables.
Inspired by the strong structural modeling capability of hypergraphs, this
paper proposes a novel hypergraph-based time series transformer backbone
network, termed HGTS-Former, to address the multivariate coupling in time
series data. Specifically, given the multivariate time series signal, we first
normalize and embed each patch into tokens. Then, we adopt the multi-head
self-attention to enhance the temporal representation of each patch. The
hierarchical hypergraphs are constructed to aggregate the temporal patterns
within each channel and fine-grained relations between different variables.
After that, we convert the hyperedge into node features through the EdgeToNode
module and adopt the feed-forward network to further enhance the output
features. Extensive experiments conducted on two multivariate time series tasks
and eight datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed
HGTS-Former. The source code will be released on
https://github.com/Event-AHU/Time_Series_Analysis.

### [210] [Modality Bias in LVLMs: Analyzing and Mitigating Object Hallucination via Attention Lens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02419)
*Haohan Zheng,Zhenguo Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）存在严重的物体幻觉问题，研究发现其原因是模态偏差，即模型难以同时关注视觉和文本模态。提出了一种无需训练的方法，通过调整注意力权重和对比解码策略来缓解幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs在理解多模态内容时表现出色，但存在物体幻觉问题，传统研究将其归因于视觉编码器与大型语言模型（LLMs）的规模不匹配。本文发现模态偏差是更深层次的原因，即模型无法同时处理视觉和文本信息。

Method: 提出一种无需训练的方法，通过干预和调整视觉与文本标记的注意力权重，平衡跨模态兼容性，并结合对比解码策略减少对参数知识的依赖。

Result: 实验证实模态偏差在LVLMs中普遍存在，所提方法有效缓解了多个开源LVLMs和基准测试中的幻觉问题。

Conclusion: 模态偏差是LVLMs物体幻觉的关键原因，提出的方法简单有效，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multimodal
comprehension and reasoning capabilities, but they still suffer from severe
object hallucination. Previous studies primarily attribute the flaw to
linguistic prior caused by the scale mismatch between visual encoders and large
language models (LLMs) in LVLMs. Specifically, as current LVLMs are built upon
LLMs, they tend to over-rely on textual prompts and internal knowledge of LLMs,
generating descriptions inconsistent with visual cues. However, through an
in-depth investigation of the hallucinated mechanisms, we empirically reveal a
previously overlooked phenomenon: LVLMs may ignore not only visual information
but also textual modality during hallucination, a behavior termed as modality
bias, which indicates that LVLMs struggle to simultaneously attend to both
visual and textual modalities, leading to fragmented understanding of
user-provided instructions. Based on this observation, we propose a simple yet
effective training-free method to mitigate object hallucination. Concretely, we
intervene and adjust the attention weights of textual and visual tokens,
balancing cross-modal compatibility for better alignment with user intentions.
Furthermore, we adopt a contrastive decoding strategy to reduce the LVLM's
overreliance on its parametric knowledge, synergistically enhancing our
attention manipulation. Extensive experiments confirm the widespread presence
of modality bias in LVLMs. Notably, our method effectively mitigates
hallucination across multiple open-source LVLMs and benchmarks, highlighting
its generalizability and efficacy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Vision Transformers（ViTs）的AI方法，直接从MRI图像预测胶质母细胞瘤患者的总体生存期（OS），无需肿瘤分割，简化了流程并降低了计算资源需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胶质母细胞瘤是一种高度侵袭性的脑肿瘤，中位生存期仅为10-15个月。准确预测OS对个性化治疗和临床决策至关重要。

Method: 利用ViTs直接从MRI图像中提取隐藏特征，避免了传统方法中的肿瘤分割步骤。

Result: 在BRATS数据集上测试，准确率达到62.5%，在精确率、召回率和F1分数上表现均衡，优于其他模型。

Conclusion: ViTs在医学影像任务中具有潜力，为高效且无需分割的OS预测模型奠定了基础，但受限于数据集规模。

Abstract: Glioblastoma is one of the most aggressive and common brain tumors, with a
median survival of 10-15 months. Predicting Overall Survival (OS) is critical
for personalizing treatment strategies and aligning clinical decisions with
patient outcomes. In this study, we propose a novel Artificial Intelligence
(AI) approach for OS prediction using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images,
exploiting Vision Transformers (ViTs) to extract hidden features directly from
MRI images, eliminating the need of tumor segmentation. Unlike traditional
approaches, our method simplifies the workflow and reduces computational
resource requirements.
  The proposed model was evaluated on the BRATS dataset, reaching an accuracy
of 62.5% on the test set, comparable to the top-performing methods.
Additionally, it demonstrated balanced performance across precision, recall,
and F1 score, overcoming the best model in these metrics. The dataset size
limits the generalization of the ViT which typically requires larger datasets
compared to convolutional neural networks. This limitation in generalization is
observed across all the cited studies. This work highlights the applicability
of ViTs for downsampled medical imaging tasks and establishes a foundation for
OS prediction models that are computationally efficient and do not rely on
segmentation.

Conclusion: InfoSyncNet通过创新设计和训练策略，显著提升了视觉语音识别的性能，为相关应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Estimating spoken content from silent videos is crucial for applications in
Assistive Technology (AT) and Augmented Reality (AR). However, accurately
mapping lip movement sequences in videos to words poses significant challenges
due to variability across sequences and the uneven distribution of information
within each sequence. To tackle this, we introduce InfoSyncNet, a non-uniform
sequence modeling network enhanced by tailored data augmentation techniques.
Central to InfoSyncNet is a non-uniform quantization module positioned between
the encoder and decoder, enabling dynamic adjustment to the network's focus and
effectively handling the natural inconsistencies in visual speech data.
Additionally, multiple training strategies are incorporated to enhance the
model's capability to handle variations in lighting and the speaker's
orientation. Comprehensive experiments on the LRW and LRW1000 datasets confirm
the superiority of InfoSyncNet, achieving new state-of-the-art accuracies of
92.0% and 60.7% Top-1 ACC. The code is available for download (see comments).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAMPO通过偏好优化技术，使视觉基础模型能够从稀疏视觉交互中推断高级类别意图，解决了SAM在密集同质对象分割中的局限性，并在医学分割任务中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM在分割任务中仅能分割明确提示的对象，无法泛化到用户隐含期望的语义相关实例，这在密集同质对象（如生物医学细胞核分割）领域尤为关键。

Method: SAMPO通过偏好优化技术，使模型能够隐式捕捉目标类别的特征，而不依赖于语言模型或像素级微调。

Result: 在三个医学分割任务中，SAMPO表现出色，例如在PanNuke-T2任务中，仅使用10%的训练数据微调，性能显著优于所有基线方法，提升了9个百分点以上。

Conclusion: SAMPO为视觉基础模型中的意图感知对齐提供了新范式，消除了对辅助提示生成器或语言模型辅助偏好学习的依赖。

Abstract: Foundation models like Segment Anything Model (SAM) excel in promptable
segmentation but suffer from an intent gap: they segment only explicitly
prompted objects, failing to generalize to semantically related instances
implicitly desired by users. This limitation is critical in domains with dense
homogeneous objects (e.g., biomedical nuclei segmentation), where sparse visual
prompts typically yield incomplete results, rendering dense annotations
impractical due to prohibitive cost. To bridge this gap, we introduce SAMPO
(Segment Anything Model with Preference Optimization), a novel framework that
teaches visual foundation models to infer high-level categorical intent from
sparse visual interactions. Unlike conventional pixel-level fine-tuning, SAMPO
optimizes models to implicitly capture target-class characteristics through
preference optimization. This approach, which operates without dependency on
language models, enables robust multi-object segmentation even under sparse
prompting and demonstrates superior data efficiency during fine-tuning.
Validated on three medical segmentation tasks, SAMPO achieves state-of-the-art
performance: on challenging tasks like PanNuke-T2, our method, when fine-tuned
with only 10% of the training data, significantly outperforms all existing
methods trained on the full 100% dataset, achieving an improvement of over 9
percentage points compared to the best baseline. Our work establishes a new
paradigm for intent-aware alignment in visual foundation models, removing
dependencies on auxiliary prompt generators or language-model-assisted
preference learning.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Hierarchical Coreset (HierCore)的新框架，用于多类图像异常检测，解决了现有方法在训练和评估阶段是否使用类别标签时的性能问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多类图像异常检测模型在性能上通常不如单类模型，且类别信息的使用方式对检测阈值定义的影响尚未充分研究。

Method: 提出了HierCore框架，利用分层记忆库估计类别的异常检测标准，无需类别标签即可有效工作。

Result: 实验表明，HierCore在所有四种场景下均满足要求，性能稳定且优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HierCore在多类图像异常检测任务中具有实际应用潜力，适用于不同类别标签可用性的场景。

Abstract: Recent advances in image anomaly detection have extended unsupervised
learning-based models from single-class settings to multi-class frameworks,
aiming to improve efficiency in training time and model storage. When a single
model is trained to handle multiple classes, it often underperforms compared to
class-specific models in terms of per-class detection accuracy. Accordingly,
previous studies have primarily focused on narrowing this performance gap.
However, the way class information is used, or not used, remains a relatively
understudied factor that could influence how detection thresholds are defined
in multi-class image anomaly detection. These thresholds, whether
class-specific or class-agnostic, significantly affect detection outcomes. In
this study, we identify and formalize the requirements that a multi-class image
anomaly detection model must satisfy under different conditions, depending on
whether class labels are available during training and evaluation. We then
re-examine existing methods under these criteria. To meet these challenges, we
propose Hierarchical Coreset (HierCore), a novel framework designed to satisfy
all defined requirements. HierCore operates effectively even without class
labels, leveraging a hierarchical memory bank to estimate class-wise decision
criteria for anomaly detection. We empirically validate the applicability and
robustness of existing methods and HierCore under four distinct scenarios,
determined by the presence or absence of class labels in the training and
evaluation phases. The experimental results demonstrate that HierCore
consistently meets all requirements and maintains strong, stable performance
across all settings, highlighting its practical potential for real-world
multi-class anomaly detection tasks.

Result: 实验表明FMS在性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FMS通过多角度监督有效提升了多模态媒体篡改检测的性能。

Abstract: The task of Detecting and Grounding Multi-Modal Media Manipulation (DGM$^4$)
is a branch of misinformation detection. Unlike traditional binary
classification, it includes complex subtasks such as forgery content
localization and forgery method classification. Consider that existing methods
are often limited in performance due to neglecting the erroneous interference
caused by unreliable unimodal data and failing to establish comprehensive
forgery supervision for mining fine-grained tampering traces. In this paper, we
present a Fine-grained Multiple Supervisory (FMS) network, which incorporates
modality reliability supervision, unimodal internal supervision and cross-modal
supervision to provide comprehensive guidance for DGM$^4$ detection. For
modality reliability supervision, we propose the Multimodal Decision Supervised
Correction (MDSC) module. It leverages unimodal weak supervision to correct the
multi-modal decision-making process. For unimodal internal supervision, we
propose the Unimodal Forgery Mining Reinforcement (UFMR) module. It amplifies
the disparity between real and fake information within unimodal modality from
both feature-level and sample-level perspectives. For cross-modal supervision,
we propose the Multimodal Forgery Alignment Reasoning (MFAR) module. It
utilizes soft-attention interactions to achieve cross-modal feature perception
from both consistency and inconsistency perspectives, where we also design the
interaction constraints to ensure the interaction quality. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our FMS compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 该研究为多镜头fMRI重建确立了新范式，通过明确分解和语义提示实现复杂视觉叙事的准确恢复。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic videos from fMRI is important for understanding visual
cognition and enabling vivid brain-computer interfaces. However, current
methods are critically limited to single-shot clips, failing to address the
multi-shot nature of real-world experiences. Multi-shot reconstruction faces
fundamental challenges: fMRI signal mixing across shots, the temporal
resolution mismatch between fMRI and video obscuring rapid scene changes, and
the lack of dedicated multi-shot fMRI-video datasets. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a novel divide-and-decode framework for multi-shot fMRI
video reconstruction. Our core innovations are: (1) A shot boundary predictor
module explicitly decomposing mixed fMRI signals into shot-specific segments.
(2) Generative keyframe captioning using LLMs, which decodes robust textual
descriptions from each segment, overcoming temporal blur by leveraging
high-level semantics. (3) Novel large-scale data synthesis (20k samples) from
existing datasets. Experimental results demonstrate our framework outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in multi-shot reconstruction fidelity. Ablation
studies confirm the critical role of fMRI decomposition and semantic

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a powerful and computationally efficient
representation for 3D reconstruction. Despite its strengths, 3DGS often
produces floating artifacts, which are erroneous structures detached from the
actual geometry and significantly degrade visual fidelity. The underlying
mechanisms causing these artifacts, particularly in low-quality initialization
scenarios, have not been fully explored. In this paper, we investigate the
origins of floating artifacts from a frequency-domain perspective and identify
under-optimized Gaussians as the primary source. Based on our analysis, we
propose \textit{Eliminating-Floating-Artifacts} Gaussian Splatting (EFA-GS),
which selectively expands under-optimized Gaussians to prioritize accurate
low-frequency learning. Additionally, we introduce complementary depth-based
and scale-based strategies to dynamically refine Gaussian expansion,
effectively mitigating detail erosion. Extensive experiments on both synthetic
and real-world datasets demonstrate that EFA-GS substantially reduces floating
artifacts while preserving high-frequency details, achieving an improvement of
1.68 dB in PSNR over baseline method on our RWLQ dataset. Furthermore, we
validate the effectiveness of our approach in downstream 3D editing tasks. Our
implementation will be released on GitHub.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReMake提出了一种新的深度补全框架，通过实例掩码和单目深度估计指导，显式区分透明区域与非透明区域，提高了深度预测的准确性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 透明物体的光学特性导致深度相机生成不完整或无效的深度数据，降低了机器人抓取的准确性和可靠性。现有方法直接输入RGB-D图像，依赖模型隐式推断深度值的可靠性，但泛化能力不足。

Method: ReMake框架结合实例掩码和单目深度估计，显式区分透明区域，专注于从RGB-D输入中学习这些区域的准确深度估计，减少对隐式推理的依赖。

Result: 实验表明，ReMake在基准数据集和真实场景中均优于现有方法，表现出更高的准确性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: ReMake通过显式区分透明区域和利用单目深度估计，显著提升了深度补全的准确性和泛化能力，适用于真实场景。

Abstract: Due to the optical properties, transparent objects often lead depth cameras
to generate incomplete or invalid depth data, which in turn reduces the
accuracy and reliability of robotic grasping. Existing approaches typically
input the RGB-D image directly into the network to output the complete depth,
expecting the model to implicitly infer the reliability of depth values.
However, while effective in training datasets, such methods often fail to
generalize to real-world scenarios, where complex light interactions lead to
highly variable distributions of valid and invalid depth data. To address this,
we propose ReMake, a novel depth completion framework guided by an instance
mask and monocular depth estimation. By explicitly distinguishing transparent
regions from non-transparent ones, the mask enables the model to concentrate on
learning accurate depth estimation in these areas from RGB-D input during
training. This targeted supervision reduces reliance on implicit reasoning and
improves generalization to real-world scenarios. Additionally, monocular depth
estimation provides depth context between the transparent object and its
surroundings, enhancing depth prediction accuracy. Extensive experiments show
that our method outperforms existing approaches on both benchmark datasets and
real-world scenarios, demonstrating superior accuracy and generalization
capability. Code and videos are available at

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用大型多模态模型（LMMs）预测短视频用户参与度的潜力，比较了两种模型（VideoLLaMA2和Qwen2.5-VL）的性能，并展示了音频特征的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着短视频平台上用户生成内容（UGC）的激增，预测用户参与度对优化推荐系统和内容创作至关重要。现有研究在多模态特征交互建模方面存在不足。

Method: 采用两种LMMs（VideoLLaMA2和Qwen2.5-VL），分别整合音频、视觉和语言模态或仅视觉和语言模态，在SnapUGC数据集上进行训练。

Result: 两种模型均表现出色，VideoLLaMA2因整合音频特征表现更优，模型集成后在ICCV VQualA 2025挑战赛中夺冠。

Conclusion: LMMs在用户参与度预测中具有显著潜力，音频特征的整合对提升性能至关重要。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of user-generated content (UGC) on short-form video
platforms has made video engagement prediction increasingly important for
optimizing recommendation systems and guiding content creation. However, this
task remains challenging due to the complex interplay of factors such as
semantic content, visual quality, audio characteristics, and user background.
Prior studies have leveraged various types of features from different
modalities, such as visual quality, semantic content, background sound, etc.,
but often struggle to effectively model their cross-feature and cross-modality
interactions. In this work, we empirically investigate the potential of large
multimodal models (LMMs) for video engagement prediction. We adopt two
representative LMMs: VideoLLaMA2, which integrates audio, visual, and language
modalities, and Qwen2.5-VL, which models only visual and language modalities.
Specifically, VideoLLaMA2 jointly processes key video frames, text-based
metadata, and background sound, while Qwen2.5-VL utilizes only key video frames
and text-based metadata. Trained on the SnapUGC dataset, both models
demonstrate competitive performance against state-of-the-art baselines,
showcasing the effectiveness of LMMs in engagement prediction. Notably,
VideoLLaMA2 consistently outperforms Qwen2.5-VL, highlighting the importance of
audio features in engagement prediction. By ensembling two types of models, our
method achieves first place in the ICCV VQualA 2025 EVQA-SnapUGC Challenge on
short-form video engagement prediction. The code is available at

TL;DR: 研究探讨了艺术斑马线对视觉行人检测模型的影响，发现复杂图案会降低检测性能，甚至可能被恶意利用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 艺术斑马线虽提升行人安全，但其视觉复杂性可能干扰基于视觉的行人检测系统。

Method: 通过合成不同艺术图案的斑马线场景，评估预训练模型在正常和恶意条件下的行人检测表现。

Result: 复杂艺术图案显著降低检测性能，恶意设计的图案可掩盖真实行人或生成虚假检测。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了城市视觉监控系统的潜在漏洞，强调需在设计行人感知模型时考虑环境视觉变化。

Abstract: Artistic crosswalks featuring asphalt art, introduced by different
organizations in recent years, aim to enhance the visibility and safety of
pedestrians. However, their visual complexity may interfere with surveillance
systems that rely on vision-based object detection models. In this study, we
investigate the impact of asphalt art on pedestrian detection performance of a
pretrained vision-based object detection model. We construct realistic
crosswalk scenarios by compositing various street art patterns into a fixed
surveillance scene and evaluate the model's performance in detecting
pedestrians on asphalt-arted crosswalks under both benign and adversarial
conditions. A benign case refers to pedestrian crosswalks painted with existing
normal asphalt art, whereas an adversarial case involves digitally crafted or
altered asphalt art perpetrated by an attacker. Our results show that while
simple, color-based designs have minimal effect, complex artistic patterns,
particularly those with high visual salience, can significantly degrade
pedestrian detection performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
adversarially crafted asphalt art can be exploited to deliberately obscure real
pedestrians or generate non-existent pedestrian detections. These findings
highlight a potential vulnerability in urban vision-based pedestrian
surveillance systems and underscore the importance of accounting for
environmental visual variations when designing robust pedestrian perception
models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PAVC框架动态调整视频压缩级别，根据天气和光照条件优化带宽使用和车辆检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决智能交通系统中因带宽限制导致的实时性能问题，同时减少视频质量下降对车辆检测精度的影响。

Method: 使用PAVC框架动态调整视频压缩级别，结合天气和光照条件优化传输和检测。

Result: PAVC提升车辆检测精度13%，带宽需求减少8.23倍（中等带宽）或72倍（极低带宽）。

Conclusion: PAVC在带宽受限环境下有效平衡视频压缩与检测精度，提升智能交通系统性能。

Abstract: Computer vision has become a popular tool in intelligent transportation
systems (ITS), enabling various applications through roadside traffic cameras
that capture video and transmit it in real time to computing devices within the
same network. The efficiency of this video transmission largely depends on the
available bandwidth of the communication system. However, limited bandwidth can
lead to communication bottlenecks, hindering the real-time performance of ITS
applications. To mitigate this issue, lossy video compression techniques can be
used to reduce bandwidth requirements, at the cost of degrading video quality.
This degradation can negatively impact the accuracy of applications that rely
on real-time vehicle detection. Additionally, vehicle detection accuracy is
influenced by environmental factors such as weather and lighting conditions,
suggesting that compression levels should be dynamically adjusted in response
to these variations. In this work, we utilize a framework called
Precision-Aware Video Compression (PAVC), where a roadside video camera
captures footage of vehicles on roadways, compresses videos, and then transmits
them to a processing unit, running a vehicle detection algorithm for
safety-critical applications, such as real-time collision risk assessment. The
system dynamically adjusts the video compression level based on current weather
and lighting conditions to maintain vehicle detection accuracy while minimizing
bandwidth usage. Our results demonstrate that PAVC improves vehicle detection
accuracy by up to 13% and reduces communication bandwidth requirements by up to
8.23x in areas with moderate bandwidth availability. Moreover, in locations
with severely limited bandwidth, PAVC reduces bandwidth requirements by up to
72x while preserving vehicle detection performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MonoDream是一个轻量级的视觉语言动作（VLA）框架，通过统一导航表示（UNR）和潜在全景梦境（LPD）任务，提升单目输入在视觉语言导航（VLN）任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决全景RGB-D传感器成本高或难以获取的问题，同时缩小单目输入与全景输入在导航性能上的差距。

Method: 提出UNR联合对齐视觉语义和语言动作意图，并通过LPD任务监督UNR，预测潜在全景特征。

Result: 在多个VLN基准测试中，MonoDream显著提升单目导航性能，缩小与全景方法的差距。

Conclusion: MonoDream为单目输入提供了一种高效且可靠的导航解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks often leverage panoramic RGB and depth
inputs to provide rich spatial cues for action planning, but these sensors can
be costly or less accessible in real-world deployments. Recent approaches based
on Vision-Language Action (VLA) models achieve strong results with monocular
input, yet they still lag behind methods using panoramic RGB-D information. We
present MonoDream, a lightweight VLA framework that enables monocular agents to
learn a Unified Navigation Representation (UNR). This shared feature
representation jointly aligns navigation-relevant visual semantics (e.g.,
global layout, depth, and future cues) and language-grounded action intent,
enabling more reliable action prediction. MonoDream further introduces Latent
Panoramic Dreaming (LPD) tasks to supervise the UNR, which train the model to
predict latent features of panoramic RGB and depth observations at both current
and future steps based on only monocular input. Experiments on multiple VLN
benchmarks show that MonoDream consistently improves monocular navigation
performance and significantly narrows the gap with panoramic-based agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到运动生成方法存在多样性不足、错误累积和物理不合理性等问题，ReMoMask旨在通过创新技术解决这些挑战。

Method: 结合双向动量文本-运动模型、语义时空注意力机制和RAG-无分类器指导，提升跨模态检索精度和运动生成的物理合理性。

Result: 在HumanML3D和KIT-ML基准测试中，FID分数分别提高了3.88%和10.97%，优于现有方法RAG-T2M。

Conclusion: ReMoMask通过创新设计显著提升了文本到运动生成的性能，成为当前最先进的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-Motion (T2M) generation aims to synthesize realistic and semantically
aligned human motion sequences from natural language descriptions. However,
current approaches face dual challenges: Generative models (e.g., diffusion
models) suffer from limited diversity, error accumulation, and physical
implausibility, while Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods exhibit
diffusion inertia, partial-mode collapse, and asynchronous artifacts. To
address these limitations, we propose ReMoMask, a unified framework integrating
three key innovations: 1) A Bidirectional Momentum Text-Motion Model decouples
negative sample scale from batch size via momentum queues, substantially
improving cross-modal retrieval precision; 2) A Semantic Spatio-temporal
Attention mechanism enforces biomechanical constraints during part-level fusion
to eliminate asynchronous artifacts; 3) RAG-Classier-Free Guidance incorporates
minor unconditional generation to enhance generalization. Built upon MoMask's
RVQ-VAE, ReMoMask efficiently generates temporally coherent motions in minimal
steps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate the
state-of-the-art performance of ReMoMask, achieving a 3.88% and 10.97%
improvement in FID scores on HumanML3D and KIT-ML, respectively, compared to
the previous SOTA method RAG-T2M. Code:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs在VQA基准测试中的评估仅依赖点估计，忽略了性能方差的影响，如随机模型输出、训练种子敏感性和超参数配置。

Method: 通过分析14个VQA基准测试，研究了训练种子、框架非确定性、模型规模和指令微调对性能方差的影响，并探索了Cloze式评估的有效性。

Result: 研究发现当前评估方法存在局限性，性能方差显著影响结果。Cloze式评估能减少随机性并提高可靠性。

Conclusion: 建议采用方差感知方法，以促进MLLMs更稳健和可靠的发展。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
visual question answering (VQA), enabling reasoning and contextual
understanding across visual and textual modalities. Despite their advancements,
the evaluation of MLLMs on VQA benchmarks often relies on point estimates,
overlooking the significant variance in performance caused by factors such as
stochastic model outputs, training seed sensitivity, and hyperparameter
configurations. This paper critically examines these issues by analyzing
variance across 14 widely used VQA benchmarks, covering diverse tasks such as
visual reasoning, text understanding, and commonsense reasoning. We
systematically study the impact of training seed, framework non-determinism,
model scale, and extended instruction finetuning on performance variability.
Additionally, we explore Cloze-style evaluation as an alternate assessment
strategy, studying its effectiveness in reducing stochasticity and improving
reliability across benchmarks. Our findings highlight the limitations of
current evaluation practices and advocate for variance-aware methodologies to
foster more robust and reliable development of MLLMs.

TL;DR: PMGS提出了一种基于3D高斯溅射的抛射运动重建方法，通过目标建模和运动恢复两阶段流程，结合牛顿力学约束和动态模拟退火策略，显著提升了高速非线性刚体运动的重建性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前动态重建方法主要局限于短时间、小尺度变形，且缺乏物理一致性考虑。PMGS旨在解决大时空跨度复杂刚体运动的建模挑战。

Method: 1) 目标建模：通过动态场景分解和改进的点密度控制实现对象中心化重建；2) 运动恢复：学习每帧SE(3)位姿恢复完整运动序列。结合加速度一致性约束和动态模拟退火策略，并采用卡尔曼融合优化多源观测误差。

Result: 实验表明，PMGS在高速非线性刚体运动重建中优于主流动态方法。

Conclusion: PMGS通过物理约束和自适应学习策略，有效解决了复杂刚体运动重建的挑战，为动态场景建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: Modeling complex rigid motion across large spatiotemporal spans remains an
unresolved challenge in dynamic reconstruction. Existing paradigms are mainly
confined to short-term, small-scale deformation and offer limited consideration
for physical consistency. This study proposes PMGS, focusing on reconstructing
Projectile Motion via 3D Gaussian Splatting. The workflow comprises two stages:
1) Target Modeling: achieving object-centralized reconstruction through dynamic
scene decomposition and an improved point density control; 2) Motion Recovery:
restoring full motion sequences by learning per-frame SE(3) poses. We introduce
an acceleration consistency constraint to bridge Newtonian mechanics and pose
estimation, and design a dynamic simulated annealing strategy that adaptively
schedules learning rates based on motion states. Futhermore, we devise a Kalman
fusion scheme to optimize error accumulation from multi-source observations to
mitigate disturbances. Experiments show PMGS's superior performance in
reconstructing high-speed nonlinear rigid motion compared to mainstream dynamic
methods.

Motivation: 当前缺乏开放可复现的医学推理模型构建方法，阻碍了社区研究和比较。

Method: 通过系统数据整理（文本和多模态数据）和两种训练范式（SFT和RLVR）构建模型。

Result: RLVR显著优于SFT，纯文本数据训练效果更好，7B模型在公开VQA基准上达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: MedVLThinker为医学多模态推理研究提供了开放基础，性能接近GPT-4o。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have introduced a new paradigm in AI by
enabling models to ``think before responding" via chain-of-thought reasoning.
However, the absence of open and reproducible recipes for building
reasoning-centric medical LMMs hinders community-wide research, analysis, and
comparison. In this paper, we present MedVLThinker, a suite of simple yet
strong baselines. Our fully open recipe consists of: (1) systematic data
curation for both text-only and image-text medical data, filtered according to
varying levels of reasoning difficulty, and (2) two training paradigms:
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on distilled reasoning traces and Reinforcement
Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) based on final answer correctness.
Across extensive experiments on the Qwen2.5-VL model family (3B, 7B) and six
medical QA benchmarks, we find that RLVR consistently and significantly
outperforms SFT. Additionally, under the RLVR framework, a key,
counter-intuitive finding is that training on our curated text-only reasoning
data provides a more substantial performance boost than training on multimodal
image-text data. Our best open 7B model, trained using the RLVR recipe on
text-only data, establishes a new state-of-the-art on existing public VQA
benchmarks, surpassing all previous open-source medical LMMs. Furthermore,
scaling our model to 32B achieves performance on par with the proprietary
GPT-4o. We release all curated data, models, and code to provide the community
with a strong, open foundation for future research in multimodal medical
reasoning.

Conclusion: AugPT是一种高效的自包含提示调优方法，通过内部数据增强实现性能提升。

Abstract: For CLIP-based prompt tuning, introducing more data as additional knowledge
for enhancing fine-tuning process is proved to be an effective approach.
Existing data amplification strategies for prompt tuning typically rely on
external knowledge (e.g., large language models or pre-structured knowledge
bases), resulting in higher costs for data collection and processing, while
generally ignoring further utilization of features in image modality. To
address this, we propose Augmentation-driven Prompt Tuning (AugPT), a
self-contained distillation-based prompt tuning approach using only internal
augmentation on raw dataset to better exploit known features. Specifically,
AugPT employs self-supervised augmentation on unlabeled images in the training
set, and introduces a novel gating mechanism based on consensus test, reusing
the pre-trained prompt tuning backbone model to spontaneously filter noisy
samples, further enhancing the quality of augmented views. Extensive
experiments validate that AugPT simultaneously enhances model performance and
generalization capability without using appended external knowledge. The code
of AugPT is available at: https://github.com/JREion/AugPT .

TL;DR: 本研究评估了五种VLMs在MedFMC数据集上的表现，Qwen2.5在多项任务中表现最佳，但复杂领域如视网膜检查仍有局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估开源VLMs在医学图像诊断中的性能，为临床应用的可行性提供依据。

Method: 使用MedFMC数据集，比较五种VLMs在三种实验设置下的诊断准确性。

Result: Qwen2.5在多项任务中表现最优，但复杂任务表现不佳，多模态输入和链式推理未提升准确性。

Conclusion: 开源VLMs在部分医学诊断任务中表现良好，但需进一步优化以适应复杂领域。

Abstract: This retrospective study evaluated five VLMs (Qwen2.5, Phi-4, Gemma3,
Llama3.2, and Mistral3.1) using the MedFMC dataset. This dataset includes
22,349 images from 7,461 patients encompassing chest radiography (19 disease
multi-label classifications), colon pathology (tumor detection), endoscopy
(colorectal lesion identification), neonatal jaundice assessment (skin
color-based treatment necessity), and retinal fundoscopy (5-point diabetic
retinopathy grading). Diagnostic accuracy was compared in three experimental
settings: visual input only, multimodal input, and chain-of-thought reasoning.
Model accuracy was assessed against ground truth labels, with statistical
comparisons using bootstrapped confidence intervals (p<.05). Qwen2.5 achieved
the highest accuracy for chest radiographs (90.4%) and endoscopy images
(84.2%), significantly outperforming the other models (p<.001). In colon
pathology, Qwen2.5 (69.0%) and Phi-4 (69.6%) performed comparably (p=.41), both
significantly exceeding other VLMs (p<.001). Similarly, for neonatal jaundice
assessment, Qwen2.5 (58.3%) and Phi-4 (58.1%) showed comparable leading
accuracies (p=.93) significantly exceeding their counterparts (p<.001). All
models struggled with retinal fundoscopy; Qwen2.5 and Gemma3 achieved the
highest, albeit modest, accuracies at 18.6% (comparable, p=.99), significantly
better than other tested models (p<.001). Unexpectedly, multimodal input
reduced accuracy for some models and modalities, and chain-of-thought reasoning
prompts also failed to improve accuracy. The open-source VLMs demonstrated
promising diagnostic capabilities, particularly in chest radiograph
interpretation. However, performance in complex domains such as retinal
fundoscopy was limited, underscoring the need for further development and
domain-specific adaptation before widespread clinical application.

Conclusion: CoCoLIT为MRI到PET的跨模态翻译提供了高效解决方案，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Synthesizing amyloid PET scans from the more widely available and accessible
structural MRI modality offers a promising, cost-effective approach for
large-scale Alzheimer's Disease (AD) screening. This is motivated by evidence
that, while MRI does not directly detect amyloid pathology, it may nonetheless
encode information correlated with amyloid deposition that can be uncovered
through advanced modeling. However, the high dimensionality and structural
complexity of 3D neuroimaging data pose significant challenges for existing
MRI-to-PET translation methods. Modeling the cross-modality relationship in a
lower-dimensional latent space can simplify the learning task and enable more
effective translation. As such, we present CoCoLIT (ControlNet-Conditioned
Latent Image Translation), a diffusion-based latent generative framework that
incorporates three main innovations: (1) a novel Weighted Image Space Loss
(WISL) that improves latent representation learning and synthesis quality; (2)
a theoretical and empirical analysis of Latent Average Stabilization (LAS), an
existing technique used in similar generative models to enhance inference
consistency; and (3) the introduction of ControlNet-based conditioning for
MRI-to-PET translation. We evaluate CoCoLIT's performance on publicly available
datasets and find that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on both image-based and amyloid-related metrics. Notably, in
amyloid-positivity classification, CoCoLIT outperforms the second-best method
with improvements of +10.5% on the internal dataset and +23.7% on the external
dataset. The code and models of our approach are available at

struggle to distinguish the unique frequency-domain characteristics of small
targets from intricate background clutter. To overcome these limitations, we
proposed the Synergistic Wavelet-Attention Network (SWAN), a novel framework
designed to perceive targets from both spatial and frequency domains. SWAN
leverages a Haar Wavelet Convolution (HWConv) for a deep, cross-domain fusion
of the frequency energy and spatial details of small target. Furthermore, a
Shifted Spatial Attention (SSA) mechanism efficiently models long-range spatial
dependencies with linear computational complexity, enhancing contextual
awareness. Finally, a Residual Dual-Channel Attention (RDCA) module adaptively
calibrates channel-wise feature responses to suppress background interference
while amplifying target-pertinent signals. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets demonstrate that SWAN surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods,
showing significant improvements in detection accuracy and robustness,
particularly in complex challenging scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统CNN在医学图像分类中需要大量计算资源和训练数据的问题。

Conclusion: EfficientNetV2在少量训练样本下表现优异，但需权衡性能与计算成本。

Abstract: The use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has greatly improved the
interpretation of medical images. However, conventional CNNs typically demand
extensive computational resources and large training datasets. To address these
limitations, this study applied transfer learning to achieve strong
classification performance using fewer training samples. Specifically, the
study compared EfficientNetV2 with its predecessor, EfficientNet, and with
ResNet50 in classifying brain tumors into three types: glioma, meningioma, and
pituitary tumors. Results showed that EfficientNetV2 delivered superior
performance compared to the other models. However, this improvement came at the
cost of increased training time, likely due to the model's greater complexity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测EGFR突变状态有助于临床决策，尤其是在东南亚人群中突变率较高，而AI模型在癌症检测中显示出潜力。

Method: 结合视觉变换器基础模型和注意力多实例学习架构，训练于印度队列数据，并在内部和外部测试集上评估。

Result: 模型在内部和外部测试集上的AUC分别为0.933和0.965，表现优于先前研究。

Conclusion: 该框架在资源有限环境下，通过常规病理切片准确预测EGFR突变状态具有可行性。

Abstract: Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is a subtype of non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC). LUAD with mutation in the EGFR gene accounts for approximately 46% of
LUAD cases. Patients carrying EGFR mutations can be treated with specific
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Hence, predicting EGFR mutation status can
help in clinical decision making. H&E-stained whole slide imaging (WSI) is a
routinely performed screening procedure for cancer staging and subtyping,
especially affecting the Southeast Asian populations with significantly higher
incidence of the mutation when compared to Caucasians (39-64% vs 7-22%). Recent
progress in AI models has shown promising results in cancer detection and
classification. In this study, we propose a deep learning (DL) framework built
on vision transformers (ViT) based pathology foundation model and
attention-based multiple instance learning (ABMIL) architecture to predict EGFR
mutation status from H&E WSI. The developed pipeline was trained using data
from an Indian cohort (170 WSI) and evaluated across two independent datasets:
Internal test (30 WSI from Indian cohort) set, and an external test set from
TCGA (86 WSI). The model shows consistent performance across both datasets,
with AUCs of 0.933 (+/-0.010), and 0.965 (+/-0.015) for the internal and
external test sets respectively. This proposed framework can be efficiently
trained on small datasets, achieving superior performance as compared to
several prior studies irrespective of training domain. The current study
demonstrates the feasibility of accurately predicting EGFR mutation status
using routine pathology slides, particularly in resource-limited settings using
foundation models and attention-based multiple instance learning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种数据驱动的稳定机制，通过自适应平均PnP算子和收缩IR算子，解决PnP方法在迭代过程中的不稳定问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PnP方法在模型驱动的图像重建中具有通用性，但黑盒网络可能导致迭代过程不稳定，影响视觉质量和PSNR。

Method: 提出一种数据驱动的稳定机制，通过自适应平均PnP算子和收缩IR算子，实现粘度正则化。

Result: 验证了该机制在不同近端算法、去噪架构和成像任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: 该稳定机制能有效抑制振荡和防止发散，提升PnP方法的稳定性。

Abstract: The plug-and-play (PnP) method uses a deep denoiser within a proximal
algorithm for model-based image reconstruction (IR). Unlike end-to-end IR, PnP
allows the same pretrained denoiser to be used across different imaging tasks,
without the need for retraining. However, black-box networks can make the
iterative process in PnP unstable. A common issue observed across architectures
like CNNs, diffusion models, and transformers is that the visual quality and
PSNR often improve initially but then degrade in later iterations. Previous
attempts to ensure stability usually impose restrictive constraints on the
denoiser. However, standard denoisers, which are freely trained for single-step
noise removal, need not satisfy such constraints. We propose a simple
data-driven stabilization mechanism that adaptively averages the potentially
unstable PnP operator with a contractive IR operator. This acts as a form of
viscosity regularization, where the contractive component progressively dampens
updates in later iterations, helping to suppress oscillations and prevent
divergence. We validate the effectiveness of our stabilization mechanism across
different proximal algorithms, denoising architectures, and imaging tasks.

Conclusion: CGCCE-Net通过创新的网络设计和模块组合，有效提升了建筑物变化检测的性能。

Abstract: Change detection encompasses a variety of task types, and the goal of
building change detection (BCD) tasks is to accurately locate buildings and
distinguish changed building areas. In recent years, various deep
learning-based BCD methods have achieved significant success in detecting
difference regions by using different change information enhancement
techniques, effectively improving the precision of BCD tasks. To address the
issue of BCD with special colors, we propose the change-guided cross
correlation enhancement network (CGCCE-Net). We design the change-guided
residual refinement (CGRR) Branch, which focuses on extending shallow texture
features to multiple scale features obtained from PVT, enabling early attention
and acquisition of special colors. Then, channel spatial attention is used in
the deep features to achieve independent information enhancement. Additionally,
we construct the global cross correlation module (GCCM) to facilitate semantic
information interaction between bi-temporal images, establishing building and
target recognition relationships between different images. Further semantic
feature enhancement is achieved through the semantic cognitive enhancement
module (SCEM), and finally, the cross fusion decoder (CFD) is used for change
information fusion and image reconstruction. Extensive experiments on three
public datasets demonstrate that our CGCCE-Net outperforms mainstream BCD
methods with outstanding performance.

Conclusion: MGCR-Net通过多模态数据语义交互，显著提升了遥感变化检测的性能。

Abstract: With the advancement of remote sensing satellite technology and the rapid
progress of deep learning, remote sensing change detection (RSCD) has become a
key technique for regional monitoring. Traditional change detection (CD)
methods and deep learning-based approaches have made significant contributions
to change analysis and detection, however, many outstanding methods still face
limitations in the exploration and application of multimodal data. To address
this, we propose the multimodal graph-conditioned vision-language
reconstruction network (MGCR-Net) to further explore the semantic interaction
capabilities of multimodal data. Multimodal large language models (MLLM) have
attracted widespread attention for their outstanding performance in computer
vision, particularly due to their powerful visual-language understanding and
dialogic interaction capabilities. Specifically, we design a MLLM-based
optimization strategy to generate multimodal textual data from the original CD
images, which serve as textual input to MGCR. Visual and textual features are
extracted through a dual encoder framework. For the first time in the RSCD
task, we introduce a multimodal graph-conditioned vision-language
reconstruction mechanism, which is integrated with graph attention to construct
a semantic graph-conditioned reconstruction module (SGCM), this module
generates vision-language (VL) tokens through graph-based conditions and
enables cross-dimensional interaction between visual and textual features via
multihead attention. The reconstructed VL features are then deeply fused using
the language vision transformer (LViT), achieving fine-grained feature
alignment and high-level semantic interaction. Experimental results on four
public datasets demonstrate that MGCR achieves superior performance compared to
mainstream CD methods. Our code is available on

Motivation: 大脑年龄的准确估计是识别神经退行性疾病相关加速衰老的关键生物标志物，但现有方法面临梯度消失和性别差异等问题。

Conclusion: DSMT-AE通过多任务学习和深度监督，有效解决了大脑年龄预测中的挑战，为神经影像分析提供了新工具。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of biological brain age from three dimensional (3D)
T$_1$-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a critical imaging biomarker
for identifying accelerated aging associated with neurodegenerative diseases.
Effective brain age prediction necessitates training 3D models to leverage
comprehensive insights from volumetric MRI scans, thereby fully capturing
spatial anatomical context. However, optimizing deep 3D models remains
challenging due to problems such as vanishing gradients. Furthermore, brain
structural patterns differ significantly between sexes, which impacts aging
trajectories and vulnerability to neurodegenerative diseases, thereby making
sex classification crucial for enhancing the accuracy and generalizability of
predictive models. To address these challenges, we propose a Deeply Supervised
Multitask Autoencoder (DSMT-AE) framework for brain age estimation. DSMT-AE
employs deep supervision, which involves applying supervisory signals at
intermediate layers during training, to stabilize model optimization, and
multitask learning to enhance feature representation. Specifically, our
framework simultaneously optimizes brain age prediction alongside auxiliary
tasks of sex classification and image reconstruction, thus effectively
capturing anatomical and demographic variability to improve prediction
accuracy. We extensively evaluate DSMT-AE on the Open Brain Health Benchmark
(OpenBHB) dataset, the largest multisite neuroimaging cohort combining ten
publicly available datasets. The results demonstrate that DSMT-AE achieves
state-of-the-art performance and robustness across age and sex subgroups.
Additionally, our ablation study confirms that each proposed component
substantially contributes to the improved predictive accuracy and robustness of
the overall architecture.

Conclusion: 双标签策略有效解决了颅神经分割任务中的固有模糊性问题。

Abstract: The parcellation of Cranial Nerves (CNs) serves as a crucial quantitative
methodology for evaluating the morphological characteristics and anatomical
pathways of specific CNs. Multi-modal CNs parcellation networks have achieved
promising segmentation performance, which combine structural Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) and diffusion MRI. However, insufficient exploration of diffusion
MRI information has led to low performance of existing multi-modal fusion. In
this work, we propose a tractography-guided Dual-label Collaborative Learning
Network (DCLNet) for multi-modal CNs parcellation. The key contribution of our
DCLNet is the introduction of coarse labels of CNs obtained from fiber
tractography through CN atlas, and collaborative learning with precise labels
annotated by experts. Meanwhile, we introduce a Modality-adaptive Encoder
Module (MEM) to achieve soft information swapping between structural MRI and
diffusion MRI. Extensive experiments conducted on the publicly available Human
Connectome Project (HCP) dataset demonstrate performance improvements compared
to single-label network. This systematic validation underscores the
effectiveness of dual-label strategies in addressing inherent ambiguities in
CNs parcellation tasks.

Conclusion: 该模型工具可帮助病理学学员学习如何像专家一样分配注意力。

Abstract: The ability to predict the attention of expert pathologists could lead to
decision support systems for better pathology training. We developed methods to
predict the spatio-temporal (where and when) movements of pathologists'
attention as they grade whole slide images (WSIs) of prostate cancer. We
characterize a pathologist's attention trajectory by their x, y, and m
(magnification) movements of a viewport as they navigate WSIs using a digital
microscope. This information was obtained from 43 pathologists across 123 WSIs,
and we consider the task of predicting the pathologist attention scanpaths
constructed from the viewport centers. We introduce a fixation extraction
algorithm that simplifies an attention trajectory by extracting fixations in
the pathologist's viewing while preserving semantic information, and we use
these pre-processed data to train and test a two-stage model to predict the
dynamic (scanpath) allocation of attention during WSI reading via intermediate
attention heatmap prediction. In the first stage, a transformer-based
sub-network predicts the attention heatmaps (static attention) across different
magnifications. In the second stage, we predict the attention scanpath by
sequentially modeling the next fixation points in an autoregressive manner
using a transformer-based approach, starting at the WSI center and leveraging
multi-magnification feature representations from the first stage. Experimental
results show that our scanpath prediction model outperforms chance and baseline
models. Tools developed from this model could assist pathology trainees in
learning to allocate their attention during WSI reading like an expert.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于LoRA的改进方法（CP-LoRA和DoRA变体），用于动脉瘤性蛛网膜下腔出血（SAH）的医学图像分割，显著优于传统Unet微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动脉瘤性蛛网膜下腔出血（SAH）死亡率高，现有方法在有限数据集上表现不足，参数高效的迁移学习方法在医学影像中应用较少。

Method: 采用Unet架构，预训练于124名创伤性脑损伤患者的CT扫描，并在30名SAH患者数据上微调。提出CP-LoRA和DoRA变体，分解权重矩阵为幅度和方向分量。

Result: LoRA方法在SAH分割中表现优于传统微调，CP-LoRA参数更少但性能相当。大出血体积下所有方法准确性更高。

Conclusion: 迁移学习在血肿类型间可行，LoRA方法显著优于传统Unet微调，为SAH分割提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a life-threatening neurological
emergency with mortality rates exceeding 30%. Transfer learning from related
hematoma types represents a potentially valuable but underexplored approach.
Although Unet architectures remain the gold standard for medical image
segmentation due to their effectiveness on limited datasets, Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) methods for parameter-efficient transfer learning have been
rarely applied to convolutional neural networks in medical imaging contexts. We
implemented a Unet architecture pre-trained on computed tomography scans from
124 traumatic brain injury patients across multiple institutions, then
fine-tuned on 30 aneurysmal SAH patients from the University of Michigan Health
System using 3-fold cross-validation. We developed a novel CP-LoRA method based
on tensor CP-decomposition and introduced DoRA variants (DoRA-C, convDoRA,
CP-DoRA) that decompose weight matrices into magnitude and directional
components. We compared these approaches against existing LoRA methods (LoRA-C,
convLoRA) and standard fine-tuning strategies across different modules on a
multi-view Unet model. LoRA-based methods consistently outperformed standard
Unet fine-tuning. Performance varied by hemorrhage volume, with all methods
showing improved accuracy for larger volumes. CP-LoRA achieved comparable
performance to existing methods while using significantly fewer parameters.
Over-parameterization with higher ranks consistently yielded better performance
than strictly low-rank adaptations. This study demonstrates that transfer
learning between hematoma types is feasible and that LoRA-based methods
significantly outperform conventional Unet fine-tuning for aneurysmal SAH
segmentation.

Conclusion: 该方法为医学图像压缩提供了高效且安全的解决方案，代码将开源。

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have driven promis ing progress in
lossless image compression. However, di rectly adopting existing paradigms for
medical images suf fers from an unsatisfactory trade-off between compression
  performance and efficiency. Moreover, existing LLM-based
  compressors often overlook the security of the compres sion process, which is
critical in modern medical scenarios.
  To this end, we propose a novel joint lossless compression
  and steganography framework. Inspired by bit plane slicing
  (BPS), we find it feasible to securely embed privacy messages
  into medical images in an invisible manner. Based on this in sight, an
adaptive modalities decomposition strategy is first
  devised to partition the entire image into two segments, pro viding global
and local modalities for subsequent dual-path
  lossless compression. During this dual-path stage, we inno vatively propose a
segmented message steganography algo rithm within the local modality path to
ensure the security of
  the compression process. Coupled with the proposed anatom ical priors-based
low-rank adaptation (A-LoRA) fine-tuning
  strategy, extensive experimental results demonstrate the su periority of our
proposed method in terms of compression ra tios, efficiency, and security. The
source code will be made

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有条件编码方法依赖隐式时间信息，虽性能优越但内存需求高，需探索更高效的缓冲策略。

Method: 采用混合缓冲策略，结合一帧显式解码帧和少量隐式学习特征作为时间参考。

Result: 混合方案优于单一显式或隐式方法，且缓冲大小降至两帧视频等效，性能损失可忽略。

Conclusion: 混合缓冲策略高效平衡性能与内存需求，为视频编码提供新思路。

Abstract: This work proposes a hybrid, explicit-implicit temporal buffering scheme for
conditional residual video coding. Recent conditional coding methods propagate
implicit temporal information for inter-frame coding, demonstrating superior
coding performance to those relying exclusively on previously decoded frames
(i.e. the explicit temporal information). However, these methods require
substantial memory to store a large number of implicit features. This work
presents a hybrid buffering strategy. For inter-frame coding, it buffers one
previously decoded frame as the explicit temporal reference and a small number
of learned features as implicit temporal reference. Our hybrid buffering scheme
for conditional residual coding outperforms the single use of explicit or
implicit information. Moreover, it allows the total buffer size to be reduced
to the equivalent of two video frames with a negligible performance drop on 2K
video sequences. The ablation experiment further sheds light on how these two
types of temporal references impact the coding performance.

Result: 在BraTS 2021上，Dice分数93.02%，IoU 86.7%，优于基线。

Conclusion: 方法在真实多中心MRI数据上表现出更高的准确性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of brain tumors in MRI scans is critical for clinical
diagnosis and treatment planning. We propose a semi-supervised, two-stage
framework that extends the ReCoSeg approach to the larger and more
heterogeneous BraTS 2021 dataset, while eliminating the need for ground-truth
masks for the segmentation objective. In the first stage, a residual-guided
denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) performs cross-modal synthesis
by reconstructing the T1ce modality from FLAIR, T1, and T2 scans. The residual
maps, capturing differences between predicted and actual T1ce images, serve as
spatial priors to enhance downstream segmentation. In the second stage, a
lightweight U-Net takes as input the concatenation of residual maps, computed
as the difference between real T1ce and synthesized T1ce, with T1, T2, and
FLAIR modalities to improve whole tumor segmentation. To address the increased
scale and variability of BraTS 2021, we apply slice-level filtering to exclude
non-informative samples and optimize thresholding strategies to balance
precision and recall. Our method achieves a Dice score of $93.02\%$ and an IoU
of $86.7\%$ for whole tumor segmentation on the BraTS 2021 dataset,
outperforming the ReCoSeg baseline on BraTS 2020 (Dice: $91.7\%$, IoU:
$85.3\%$), and demonstrating improved accuracy and scalability for real-world,
multi-center MRI datasets.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression follows a complex continuum from normal
cognition (NC) through mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia, yet most
deep learning approaches oversimplify this into discrete classification tasks.
This study introduces M$^3$AD, a novel multi-task multi-gate mixture of experts
framework that jointly addresses diagnostic classification and cognitive
transition modeling using structural MRI. We incorporate three key innovations:
(1) an open-source T1-weighted sMRI preprocessing pipeline, (2) a unified
learning framework capturing NC-MCI-AD transition patterns with demographic
priors (age, gender, brain volume) for improved generalization, and (3) a
customized multi-gate mixture of experts architecture enabling effective
multi-task learning with structural MRI alone. The framework employs
specialized expert networks for diagnosis-specific pathological patterns while
shared experts model common structural features across the cognitive continuum.
A two-stage training protocol combines SimMIM pretraining with multi-task
fine-tuning for joint optimization. Comprehensive evaluation across six
datasets comprising 12,037 T1-weighted sMRI scans demonstrates superior
performance: 95.13% accuracy for three-class NC-MCI-AD classification and
99.15% for binary NC-AD classification, representing improvements of 4.69% and
0.55% over state-of-the-art approaches. The multi-task formulation
simultaneously achieves 97.76% accuracy in predicting cognitive transition. Our
framework outperforms existing methods using fewer modalities and offers a
clinically practical solution for early intervention. Code:

Conclusion: Mobile U-ViT是一种高效、强大且通用的移动医学图像分析解决方案。

Abstract: In clinical practice, medical image analysis often requires efficient
execution on resource-constrained mobile devices. However, existing mobile
models-primarily optimized for natural images-tend to perform poorly on medical
tasks due to the significant information density gap between natural and
medical domains. Combining computational efficiency with medical
imaging-specific architectural advantages remains a challenge when developing
lightweight, universal, and high-performing networks. To address this, we
propose a mobile model called Mobile U-shaped Vision Transformer (Mobile U-ViT)
tailored for medical image segmentation. Specifically, we employ the newly
purposed ConvUtr as a hierarchical patch embedding, featuring a
parameter-efficient large-kernel CNN with inverted bottleneck fusion. This
design exhibits transformer-like representation learning capacity while being
lighter and faster. To enable efficient local-global information exchange, we
introduce a novel Large-kernel Local-Global-Local (LGL) block that effectively
balances the low information density and high-level semantic discrepancy of
medical images. Finally, we incorporate a shallow and lightweight transformer
bottleneck for long-range modeling and employ a cascaded decoder with
downsample skip connections for dense prediction. Despite its reduced
computational demands, our medical-optimized architecture achieves
state-of-the-art performance across eight public 2D and 3D datasets covering
diverse imaging modalities, including zero-shot testing on four unseen
datasets. These results establish it as an efficient yet powerful and
generalization solution for mobile medical image analysis. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确的乳腺肿瘤分割对下游任务（如pCR评估）至关重要，但现有方法在性能和泛化能力上仍有提升空间。

Method: 采用两阶段训练策略和大核MedNeXt架构，通过UpKern算法扩展感受野，并结合放射组学特征训练SNN进行分类。

Result: 分割任务中Dice得分为0.67，NormHD为0.24；pCR分类的平均平衡准确率为57%，部分子组达75%。

Conclusion: 大感受野与放射组学结合显著提升性能，未来可通过高级集成和临床变量进一步优化。

Abstract: Accurate breast tumor segmentation in dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic
resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) is important for downstream tasks such as
pathological complete response (pCR) assessment. In this work, we address both
segmentation and pCR classification using the large-scale MAMA-MIA DCE-MRI
dataset. We employ a large-kernel MedNeXt architecture with a two-stage
training strategy that expands the receptive field from 3x3x3 to 5x5x5 kernels
using the UpKern algorithm. This approach allows stable transfer of learned
features to larger kernels, improving segmentation performance on the unseen
validation set. An ensemble of large-kernel models achieved a Dice score of
0.67 and a normalized Hausdorff Distance (NormHD) of 0.24. For pCR
classification, we trained a self-normalizing network (SNN) on radiomic
features extracted from the predicted segmentations and first post-contrast
DCE-MRI, reaching an average balanced accuracy of 57\%, and up to 75\% in some
subgroups. Our findings highlight the benefits of combining larger receptive
fields and radiomics-driven classification while motivating future work on
advanced ensembling and the integration of clinical variables to further
improve performance and generalization. Code:

Result: 模型参数减少80%，训练效率和推理速度显著提升，在ACDC和Synapse数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: AMBER-AFNO在医疗图像分割中实现了高效且高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: This work presents the results of a methodological transfer from remote
sensing to healthcare, adapting AMBER -- a transformer-based model originally
designed for multiband images, such as hyperspectral data -- to the task of 3D
medical datacube segmentation. In this study, we use the AMBER architecture
with Adaptive Fourier Neural Operators (AFNO) in place of the multi-head
self-attention mechanism. While existing models rely on various forms of
attention to capture global context, AMBER-AFNO achieves this through
frequency-domain mixing, enabling a drastic reduction in model complexity. This
design reduces the number of trainable parameters by over 80% compared to
UNETR++, while maintaining a FLOPs count comparable to other state-of-the-art
architectures. Model performance is evaluated on two benchmark 3D medical
datasets -- ACDC and Synapse -- using standard metrics such as Dice Similarity
Coefficient (DSC) and Hausdorff Distance (HD), demonstrating that AMBER-AFNO
achieves competitive or superior accuracy with significant gains in training
efficiency, inference speed, and memory usage.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于RNN的视频编码方法存在输出递归性能不足或隐式特征传播缓冲区需求大的问题。

Method: 提出HyTIP框架，混合使用显式解码帧和少量隐式潜在特征，平衡性能与缓冲区需求。

Result: HyTIP在PSNR-RGB和MS-SSIM-RGB上优于VTM 17.0，且缓冲区需求更小。

Conclusion: HyTIP通过混合机制在性能和缓冲区效率上取得平衡，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Most frame-based learned video codecs can be interpreted as recurrent neural
networks (RNNs) propagating reference information along the temporal dimension.
This work revisits the limitations of the current approaches from an RNN
perspective. The output-recurrence methods, which propagate decoded frames, are
intuitive but impose dual constraints on the output decoded frames, leading to
suboptimal rate-distortion performance. In contrast, the hidden-to-hidden
connection approaches, which propagate latent features within the RNN, offer
greater flexibility but require large buffer sizes. To address these issues, we
propose HyTIP, a learned video coding framework that combines both mechanisms.
Our hybrid buffering strategy uses explicit decoded frames and a small number
of implicit latent features to achieve competitive coding performance.
Experimental results show that our HyTIP outperforms the sole use of either
output-recurrence or hidden-to-hidden approaches. Furthermore, it achieves
comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods but with a much smaller
buffer size, and outperforms VTM 17.0 (Low-delay B) in terms of PSNR-RGB and
MS-SSIM-RGB. The source code of HyTIP is available at

Motivation: 解决临床影像中肿瘤分类的挑战，如模态质量不均、标注有限和缺乏结构化解剖指导。

Conclusion: REACT-KD在真实世界诊断中具有潜力，决策曲线分析显示其临床效益显著。

Abstract: Reliable and interpretable tumor classification from clinical imaging remains
a core challenge due to heterogeneous modality quality, limited annotations,
and the lack of structured anatomical guidance. We introduce REACT-KD, a
Region-Aware Cross-modal Topological Knowledge Distillation framework that
transfers rich supervision from high-fidelity multi-modal sources into a
lightweight CT-based student model. The framework uses a dual teacher design:
one branch captures structure-function relationships using dual-tracer PET/CT,
and the other models dose-aware features through synthetically degraded
low-dose CT data. These branches jointly guide the student model through two
complementary objectives. The first focuses on semantic alignment via logits
distillation, while the second models anatomical topology using region graph
distillation. A shared CBAM-3D module is employed to maintain consistent
attention across modalities. To improve reliability for deployment, REACT-KD
introduces modality dropout during training, allowing inference under partial
or noisy inputs. The staging task for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is
conducted as a case study. REACT-KD achieves an average AUC of 93.4% on an
internal PET/CT cohort and maintains 76.6% to 81.5% AUC across varying dose
levels in external CT testing. Decision curve analysis shows that REACT-KD
consistently provides the highest clinical benefit across decision thresholds,
supporting its potential in real-world diagnostics. Code is available at

Method: 提出了一种基于非零Gram行列式的过定系统方法，设计了两种新型网络WIN-Naïve和WIN，后者通过高级跳跃连接增强长期记忆。

Result: 在多种RIC任务中（如图像隐藏、图像缩放和去色）取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法克服了现有RIC解决方案的瓶颈，为领域设定了新基准。

Abstract: Reversible image conversion (RIC) suffers from ill-posedness issues due to
its forward conversion process being considered an underdetermined system.
Despite employing invertible neural networks (INN), existing RIC methods
intrinsically remain ill-posed as inevitably introducing uncertainty by
incorporating randomly sampled variables. To tackle the ill-posedness dilemma,
we focus on developing a reliable approximate left inverse for the
underdetermined system by constructing an overdetermined system with a non-zero
Gram determinant, thus ensuring a well-posed solution. Based on this principle,
we propose a well-posed invertible $1\times1$ convolution (WIC), which
eliminates the reliance on random variable sampling and enables the development
of well-posed invertible networks. Furthermore, we design two innovative
networks, WIN-Na\"ive and WIN, with the latter incorporating advanced
skip-connections to enhance long-term memory. Our methods are evaluated across
diverse RIC tasks, including reversible image hiding, image rescaling, and
image decolorization, consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating
its ability to overcome the bottlenecks of existing RIC solutions and setting a
new benchmark in the field. Codes are available in

Conclusion: GR-Gaussian在稀疏视图条件下能有效提高CT重建的准确性。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a promising approach for CT
reconstruction. However, existing methods rely on the average gradient
magnitude of points within the view, often leading to severe needle-like
artifacts under sparse-view conditions. To address this challenge, we propose
GR-Gaussian, a graph-based 3D Gaussian Splatting framework that suppresses
needle-like artifacts and improves reconstruction accuracy under sparse-view
conditions. Our framework introduces two key innovations: (1) a Denoised Point
Cloud Initialization Strategy that reduces initialization errors and
accelerates convergence; and (2) a Pixel-Graph-Aware Gradient Strategy that
refines gradient computation using graph-based density differences, improving
splitting accuracy and density representation. Experiments on X-3D and
real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of GR-Gaussian, achieving PSNR
improvements of 0.67 dB and 0.92 dB, and SSIM gains of 0.011 and 0.021. These
results highlight the applicability of GR-Gaussian for accurate CT
reconstruction under challenging sparse-view conditions.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 该研究评估了多种多实例学习（MIL）技术，用于检测非小细胞肺癌（NSCLC）中的六种关键驱动突变，并提出了一种新型非对称Transformer解码器模型，显著提升了预测性能。

Motivation: 尽管基因检测对NSCLC治疗决策至关重要，但其广泛应用受限于可用性和耗时问题。机器学习方法为计算病理学提供了潜在解决方案，但现有研究多局限于少数常见突变，限制了临床价值。

Method: 研究采用多种MIL技术，并引入非对称Transformer解码器模型，通过不同维度的查询和键值提取信息，同时提出一种直接利用组织类型的方法以解决MIL的局限性。

Result: 该方法平均性能优于顶级MIL模型3%，在预测罕见突变（如ERBB2和BRAF）时提升超过4%，使ML测试更接近成为标准基因检测的实用替代方案。

Conclusion: 该研究通过改进MIL技术和引入新型模型，显著提升了NSCLC驱动突变的检测能力，为临床提供了更高效的替代方案。

Abstract: Identifying actionable driver mutations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
can impact treatment decisions and significantly improve patient outcomes.
Despite guideline recommendations, broader adoption of genetic testing remains
challenging due to limited availability and lengthy turnaround times. Machine
Learning (ML) methods for Computational Pathology (CPath) offer a potential
solution; however, research often focuses on only one or two common mutations,
limiting the clinical value of these tools and the pool of patients who can
benefit from them. This study evaluates various Multiple Instance Learning
(MIL) techniques to detect six key actionable NSCLC driver mutations: ALK,
BRAF, EGFR, ERBB2, KRAS, and MET ex14. Additionally, we introduce an Asymmetric
Transformer Decoder model that employs queries and key-values of varying
dimensions to maintain a low query dimensionality. This approach efficiently
extracts information from patch embeddings and minimizes overfitting risks,
proving highly adaptable to the MIL setting. Moreover, we present a method to
directly utilize tissue type in the model, addressing a typical MIL limitation
where either all regions or only some specific regions are analyzed, neglecting
biological relevance. Our method outperforms top MIL models by an average of
3%, and over 4% when predicting rare mutations such as ERBB2 and BRAF, moving
ML-based tests closer to being practical alternatives to standard genetic
testing.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Star-Diff的结构感知染色恢复扩散模型，用于从H&E染色虚拟生成IHC染色图像，解决了现有方法在图像对齐和生物变异性保存上的挑战，并通过Semantic Fidelity Score (SFS)评估诊断一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: H&E染色缺乏分子诊断信息，而IHC染色成本高且耗时。虚拟染色技术有望填补这一空白，但面临图像对齐和结构保存的挑战。

Method: 提出Star-Diff模型，结合残差和噪声生成路径，将虚拟染色任务重新定义为图像恢复任务，并引入SFS评估诊断一致性。

Result: 在BCI数据集上，Star-Diff在视觉保真度和诊断相关性上均达到SOTA性能，且推理速度快。

Conclusion: Star-Diff为术中虚拟IHC合成等应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining is the clinical standard for assessing
tissue morphology, but it lacks molecular-level diagnostic information. In
contrast, immunohistochemistry (IHC) provides crucial insights into biomarker
expression, such as HER2 status for breast cancer grading, but remains costly
and time-consuming, limiting its use in time-sensitive clinical workflows. To
address this gap, virtual staining from H&E to IHC has emerged as a promising
alternative, yet faces two core challenges: (1) Lack of fair evaluation of
synthetic images against misaligned IHC ground truths, and (2) preserving
structural integrity and biological variability during translation. To this
end, we present an end-to-end framework encompassing both generation and
evaluation in this work. We introduce Star-Diff, a structure-aware staining
restoration diffusion model that reformulates virtual staining as an image
restoration task. By combining residual and noise-based generation pathways,
Star-Diff maintains tissue structure while modeling realistic biomarker
variability. To evaluate the diagnostic consistency of the generated IHC
patches, we propose the Semantic Fidelity Score (SFS), a
clinical-grading-task-driven metric that quantifies class-wise semantic
degradation based on biomarker classification accuracy. Unlike pixel-level
metrics such as SSIM and PSNR, SFS remains robust under spatial misalignment
and classifier uncertainty. Experiments on the BCI dataset demonstrate that
Star-Diff achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both visual fidelity
and diagnostic relevance. With rapid inference and strong clinical alignment,it
presents a practical solution for applications such as intraoperative virtual
IHC synthesis.

Conclusion: RL-U$^2$Net在多模态心脏分割中表现出高效性和优越性，为临床诊断提供了更精准的工具。

Abstract: Accurate whole-heart segmentation is a critical component in the precise
diagnosis and interventional planning of cardiovascular diseases. Integrating
complementary information from modalities such as computed tomography (CT) and
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can significantly enhance segmentation
accuracy and robustness. However, existing multi-modal segmentation methods
face several limitations: severe spatial inconsistency between modalities
hinders effective feature fusion; fusion strategies are often static and lack
adaptability; and the processes of feature alignment and segmentation are
decoupled and inefficient. To address these challenges, we propose a
dual-branch U-Net architecture enhanced by reinforcement learning for feature
alignment, termed RL-U$^2$Net, designed for precise and efficient multi-modal
3D whole-heart segmentation. The model employs a dual-branch U-shaped network
to process CT and MRI patches in parallel, and introduces a novel RL-XAlign
module between the encoders. The module employs a cross-modal attention
mechanism to capture semantic correspondences between modalities and a
reinforcement-learning agent learns an optimal rotation strategy that
consistently aligns anatomical pose and texture features. The aligned features
are then reconstructed through their respective decoders. Finally, an
ensemble-learning-based decision module integrates the predictions from
individual patches to produce the final segmentation result. Experimental
results on the publicly available MM-WHS 2017 dataset demonstrate that the
proposed RL-U$^2$Net outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving
Dice coefficients of 93.1% on CT and 87.0% on MRI, thereby validating the
effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach.

Result: 研究发现3D绘制中的深度、边缘距离和相对方向等因素对可读性有显著影响。

Conclusion: 3D图形绘制中的边缘配置及其影响因素需进一步研究，以优化可视化效果和分析效率。

Abstract: Human perception of graph drawings is influenced by a variety of impact
factors for which quality measures are used as a proxy indicator. The
investigation of those impact factors and their effects is important to
evaluate and improve quality measures and drawing algorithms. The number of
edge crossings in a 2D graph drawing has long been a main quality measure for
drawing evaluation. The use of stereoscopic 3D graph visualisations has gained
attraction over the last years, and results from several studies indicate that
they can improve analysis efficiency for a range of analysis scenarios. While
edge crossings can also occur in 3D, there are edge configurations in space
that are not crossings but might be perceived as such from a specific
viewpoint. Such configurations create crossings when projected on the
corresponding 2D image plane and could impact readability similar to 2D
crossings. In 3D drawings, the additional depth aspect and the subsequent
impact factors of edge distance and relative edge direction in space might
further influence the importance of those configurations for readability. We
investigate the impact of such factors in an empirical study and report on
findings of difference between major factor categories.

Abstract: We present MeshLLM, a novel framework that leverages large language models
(LLMs) to understand and generate text-serialized 3D meshes. Our approach
addresses key limitations in existing methods, including the limited dataset
scale when catering to LLMs' token length and the loss of 3D structural
information during mesh serialization. We introduce a Primitive-Mesh
decomposition strategy, which divides 3D meshes into structurally meaningful
subunits. This enables the creation of a large-scale dataset with 1500k+
samples, almost 50 times larger than previous methods, which aligns better with
the LLM scaling law principles. Furthermore, we propose inferring face
connectivity from vertices and local mesh assembly training strategies,
significantly enhancing the LLMs' ability to capture mesh topology and spatial
structures. Experiments show that MeshLLM outperforms the state-of-the-art
LLaMA-Mesh in both mesh generation quality and shape understanding,
highlighting its great potential in processing text-serialized 3D meshes.

Conclusion: ReMu为单目相机下的多层3D服装重建提供了高效、通用的解决方案。

Abstract: The reconstruction of multi-layer 3D garments typically requires expensive
multi-view capture setups and specialized 3D editing efforts. To support the
creation of life-like clothed human avatars, we introduce ReMu for
reconstructing multi-layer clothed humans in a new setup, Image Layers, which
captures a subject wearing different layers of clothing with a single RGB
camera. To reconstruct physically plausible multi-layer 3D garments, a unified
3D representation is necessary to model these garments in a layered manner.
Thus, we first reconstruct and align each garment layer in a shared coordinate
system defined by the canonical body pose. Afterwards, we introduce a
collision-aware optimization process to address interpenetration and further
refine the garment boundaries leveraging implicit neural fields. It is worth
noting that our method is template-free and category-agnostic, which enables
the reconstruction of 3D garments in diverse clothing styles. Through our
experiments, we show that our method reconstructs nearly penetration-free 3D
clothed humans and achieves competitive performance compared to
category-specific methods. Project page: https://eth-ait.github.io/ReMu/

Abstract: In-betweening human motion generation aims to synthesize intermediate motions
that transition between user-specified keyframes. In addition to maintaining
smooth transitions, a crucial requirement of this task is to generate diverse
motion sequences. It is still challenging to maintain diversity, particularly
when it is necessary for the motions within a generated batch sampling to
differ meaningfully from one another due to complex motion dynamics. In this
paper, we propose a novel method, termed the Multi-Criteria Guidance with
In-Betweening Motion Model (MCG-IMM), for in-betweening human motion
generation. A key strength of MCG-IMM lies in its plug-and-play nature: it
enhances the diversity of motions generated by pretrained models without
introducing additional parameters This is achieved by providing a sampling
process of pretrained generative models with multi-criteria guidance.
Specifically, MCG-IMM reformulates the sampling process of pretrained
generative model as a multi-criteria optimization problem, and introduces an
optimization process to explore motion sequences that satisfy multiple
criteria, e.g., diversity and smoothness. Moreover, our proposed plug-and-play
multi-criteria guidance is compatible with different families of generative
models, including denoised diffusion probabilistic models, variational
autoencoders, and generative adversarial networks. Experiments on four popular
human motion datasets demonstrate that MCG-IMM consistently state-of-the-art

Abstract: In this work, we present a novel method for uncertainty estimation (UE) in
Gaussian Splatting. UE is crucial for using Gaussian Splatting in critical
applications such as robotics and medicine. Previous methods typically estimate
the variance of Gaussian primitives and use the rendering process to obtain
pixel-wise uncertainties. Our method establishes primitive representations of
error and visibility of trainings views, which carries meaningful uncertainty
information. This representation is obtained by projection of training error
and visibility onto the primitives. Uncertainties of novel views are obtained
by rendering the primitive representations of uncertainty for those novel
views, yielding uncertainty feature maps. To aggregate these uncertainty
feature maps of novel views, we perform a pixel-wise regression on holdout
data. In our experiments, we analyze the different components of our method,
investigating various combinations of uncertainty feature maps and regression
models. Furthermore, we considered the effect of separating splatting into
foreground and background. Our UEs show high correlations to true errors,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods, especially on foreground objects. The
trained regression models show generalization capabilities to new scenes,
allowing uncertainty estimation without the need for holdout data.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合局部和全局特征的流体注意力块（FAB），首次将Transformer架构用于连续流体模拟，显著提升了复杂流体场景的稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于神经网络的流体模拟方法仅依赖局部粒子交互，缺乏全局上下文整合，导致复杂模拟中误差累积和不稳定。

Method: 提出Fluid Attention Block（FAB），结合连续卷积提取局部特征和自注意力机制捕捉全局依赖，并设计首个专为连续流体模拟的Transformer架构。

Result: FluidFormer在复杂流体场景中表现出色，具有更强的稳定性，成为神经流体模拟的新范式。

Conclusion: 通过融合局部卷积特征和全局注意力建模，FluidFormer为神经流体模拟提供了更稳定和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Learning-based fluid simulation networks have been proven as viable
alternatives to traditional numerical solvers for the Navier-Stokes equations.
Existing neural methods follow Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH)
frameworks, which inherently rely only on local inter-particle interactions.
However, we emphasize that global context integration is also essential for
learning-based methods to stabilize complex fluid simulations. We propose the
first Fluid Attention Block (FAB) with a local-global hierarchy, where
continuous convolutions extract local features while self-attention captures
global dependencies. This fusion suppresses the error accumulation and models
long-range physical phenomena. Furthermore, we pioneer the first Transformer
architecture specifically designed for continuous fluid simulation, seamlessly
integrated within a dual-pipeline architecture. Our method establishes a new
paradigm for neural fluid simulation by unifying convolution-based local
features with attention-based global context modeling. FluidFormer demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance, with stronger stability in complex fluid
scenarios.

TL;DR: HBMNet提出了一种分层边界建模网络，用于定位音频-视觉时序深度伪造区域，通过多模块协作提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决内容驱动的部分操纵下音频-视觉时序深度伪造定位的挑战性问题，尤其是伪造区域仅占少数帧的情况。

Method: HBMNet包含音频-视觉特征编码器、粗粒度提案生成器和细粒度概率生成器，结合多模态编码与融合、多尺度时序线索和双向边界-内容关系。

Result: 实验表明HBMNet在精度和召回率上均有提升，优于BA-TFD和UMMAFormer，并显示出更强的数据扩展潜力。

Conclusion: HBMNet通过多模块互补和模态强化，显著提升了音频-视觉深度伪造定位的性能。

Abstract: Audio-visual temporal deepfake localization under the content-driven partial
manipulation remains a highly challenging task. In this scenario, the deepfake
regions are usually only spanning a few frames, with the majority of the rest
remaining identical to the original. To tackle this, we propose a Hierarchical
Boundary Modeling Network (HBMNet), which includes three modules: an
Audio-Visual Feature Encoder that extracts discriminative frame-level
representations, a Coarse Proposal Generator that predicts candidate boundary
regions, and a Fine-grained Probabilities Generator that refines these
proposals using bidirectional boundary-content probabilities. From the modality
perspective, we enhance audio-visual learning through dedicated encoding and
fusion, reinforced by frame-level supervision to boost discriminability. From
the temporal perspective, HBMNet integrates multi-scale cues and bidirectional
boundary-content relationships. Experiments show that encoding and fusion
primarily improve precision, while frame-level supervision boosts recall. Each
module (audio-visual fusion, temporal scales, bi-directionality) contributes
complementary benefits, collectively enhancing localization performance. HBMNet
outperforms BA-TFD and UMMAFormer and shows improved potential scalability with
more training data.

Motivation: 音频深度伪造的泛滥威胁数字通信信任，现有方法在模型溯源方面研究不足。

Method: 使用卷积自编码器提取注意力增强的潜在表示，结合两个分类器（ADA和ADMR）进行技术识别和模型实例识别，并引入置信度阈值提升鲁棒性。

Result: ADA分类器F1分数超过95%，ADMR模块在六类中达到96.31%宏F1，且在未见攻击中表现鲁棒。

Conclusion: LAVA框架在公开基准测试中验证了其有效性，为开放集条件下的深度伪造溯源提供了新方法。

Abstract: The proliferation of audio deepfakes poses a growing threat to trust in
digital communications. While detection methods have advanced, attributing
audio deepfakes to their source models remains an underexplored yet crucial
challenge. In this paper we introduce LAVA (Layered Architecture for Voice
Attribution), a hierarchical framework for audio deepfake detection and model
recognition that leverages attention-enhanced latent representations extracted
by a convolutional autoencoder trained solely on fake audio. Two specialized
classifiers operate on these features: Audio Deepfake Attribution (ADA), which
identifies the generation technology, and Audio Deepfake Model Recognition
(ADMR), which recognize the specific generative model instance. To improve
robustness under open-set conditions, we incorporate confidence-based rejection
thresholds. Experiments on ASVspoof2021, FakeOrReal, and CodecFake show strong
performance: the ADA classifier achieves F1-scores over 95% across all
datasets, and the ADMR module reaches 96.31% macro F1 across six classes.
Additional tests on unseen attacks from ASVpoof2019 LA and error propagation
analysis confirm LAVA's robustness and reliability. The framework advances the
field by introducing a supervised approach to deepfake attribution and model
recognition under open-set conditions, validated on public benchmarks and
accompanied by publicly released models and code. Models and code are available

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的点扩散模型，通过独立处理时空点来高效预测复杂物理系统，具有形状变化适应性。该方法在保持几何保真度的同时，支持直接处理多种数据格式（如网格和点云）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于图像的扩散模型在处理结构化数据时效率低下，且难以适应复杂几何配置的物理系统。本研究旨在开发一种更高效、灵活的方法。

Method: 采用点级扩散过程，结合点级扩散变换器架构进行去噪。使用DDIM进行高效确定性采样，仅需5-10步，显著提升计算速度。

Result: 在三个物理系统中验证了方法的优越性：训练时间减少94.4%，参数减少89.0%，预测精度提升28%以上。计算速度提升100-200倍。

Conclusion: 点扩散模型在复杂物理系统预测中表现出色，兼具高效性和准确性，优于传统方法和其他替代模型。

Abstract: This study introduces a novel point-wise diffusion model that processes
spatio-temporal points independently to efficiently predict complex physical
systems with shape variations. This methodological contribution lies in
applying forward and backward diffusion processes at individual spatio-temporal
points, coupled with a point-wise diffusion transformer architecture for
denoising. Unlike conventional image-based diffusion models that operate on
structured data representations, this framework enables direct processing of
any data formats including meshes and point clouds while preserving geometric
fidelity. We validate our approach across three distinct physical domains with
complex geometric configurations: 2D spatio-temporal systems including cylinder
fluid flow and OLED drop impact test, and 3D large-scale system for road-car
external aerodynamics. To justify the necessity of our point-wise approach for
real-time prediction applications, we employ denoising diffusion implicit
models (DDIM) for efficient deterministic sampling, requiring only 5-10 steps
compared to traditional 1000-step and providing computational speedup of 100 to
200 times during inference without compromising accuracy. In addition, our
proposed model achieves superior performance compared to image-based diffusion
model: reducing training time by 94.4% and requiring 89.0% fewer parameters
while achieving over 28% improvement in prediction accuracy. Comprehensive
comparisons against data-flexible surrogate models including DeepONet and
Meshgraphnet demonstrate consistent superiority of our approach across all
three physical systems. To further refine the proposed model, we investigate
two key aspects: 1) comparison of final physical states prediction or
incremental change prediction, and 2) computational efficiency evaluation
across varying subsampling ratios (10%-100%).

Conclusion: DeepFSI显著提升了噪声鲁棒性计算成像的性能，适用于光子受限的应用场景。

Abstract: Modern photon-counting sensors are increasingly dominated by Poisson noise,
yet conventional Feature-Specific Imaging (FSI) is optimized for additive
Gaussian noise, leading to suboptimal performance and a loss of its advantages
under Poisson noise. To address this, we introduce DeepFSI, a novel end-to-end
optical-electronic framework. DeepFSI "unfreezes" traditional FSI masks,
enabling a deep neural network to learn globally optimal measurement masks by
computing gradients directly under realistic Poisson and additive noise
conditions. Our simulations demonstrate DeepFSI's superior feature fidelity and
task performance compared to conventional FSI with predefined masks, especially
in Poisson-Noise-dominant environments. DeepFSI also exhibits enhanced
robustness to design choices and performs well under additive Gaussian noise,
representing a significant advance for noise-robust computational imaging in
photon-limited applications.

Conclusion: 代数连通性是提取超边权重的有效方法，能够捕捉大脑功能信息，为AD研究提供新视角。

Abstract: Functional MRI is a neuroimaging technique aiming at analyzing the functional
activity of the brain by measuring blood-oxygen-level-dependent signals
throughout the brain. The derived functional features can be used for
investigating brain alterations in neurological and psychiatric disorders. In
this work, we employed the hypergraph structure to model high-order functional
relations across brain regions, introducing algebraic connectivity (a(G)) for
estimating the hyperedge weights. The hypergraph structure was derived from
healthy controls to build a common topological structure across individuals.
The considered cohort included subjects covering the Alzheimer's disease (AD)
continuum, that is both mild cognitive impairment and AD patients. Statistical
analysis was performed using the hyperedges' weights as features to assess the
differences across the three groups. Additionally, a mediation analysis was
performed to evaluate the effectiveness and reliability of the a(G) values,
representing the functional information, as the mediator between tau-PET
levels, a key biomarker of AD, and cognitive scores. The proposed approach
outperformed state-of-the-art methods in identifying a larger number of
hyperedges statistically different across groups. Among these, two hyperedges
belonging to salience ventral attention and somatomotor networks showed a
partial mediation effect between the tau biomarkers and cognitive decline.
These results suggested that the a(G) can be an effective approach for
extracting the hyperedge weights, including important functional information
that resides in the brain areas forming the hyperedges.

Motivation: 研究CP系统在对抗性攻击下的鲁棒性，尤其是针对时间性（可用性）的攻击，填补了现有研究的空白。

Method: 提出CP-FREEZER攻击，解决点云预处理不可微、受害者输入异步等挑战，采用新型损失函数最大化CP流程执行时间。

Result: 实验显示，攻击使CP延迟增加90倍以上，单帧处理时间超过3秒，成功率100%。

Conclusion: 揭示了CP系统可用性的严重威胁，亟需鲁棒防御措施。

Abstract: Cooperative perception (CP) enhances situational awareness of connected and
autonomous vehicles by exchanging and combining messages from multiple agents.
While prior work has explored adversarial integrity attacks that degrade
perceptual accuracy, little is known about CP's robustness against attacks on
timeliness (or availability), a safety-critical requirement for autonomous
driving. In this paper, we present CP-FREEZER, the first latency attack that
maximizes the computation delay of CP algorithms by injecting adversarial
perturbation via V2V messages. Our attack resolves several unique challenges,
including the non-differentiability of point cloud preprocessing, asynchronous
knowledge of the victim's input due to transmission delays, and uses a novel
loss function that effectively maximizes the execution time of the CP pipeline.
Extensive experiments show that CP-FREEZER increases end-to-end CP latency by
over $90\times$, pushing per-frame processing time beyond 3 seconds with a 100%
success rate on our real-world vehicle testbed. Our findings reveal a critical
threat to the availability of CP systems, highlighting the urgent need for
robust defenses.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了高占空比刺激对减轻视觉疲劳和提高SSVEP性能的影响，发现85%占空比效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SSVEP应用中视觉疲劳和高精度PWM调制的困难限制了其长期使用，需寻找解决方案。

Method: 使用50%至95%占空比的PWM刺激，通过定制LED硬件记录脑电图数据，测试10名受试者。

Result: 高占空比减少视觉疲劳，85%占空比时SSVEP响应最佳且受试者独立。

Conclusion: 85%占空比刺激可提升SSVEP的实用性和长期使用潜力。

Abstract: Steady state visual evoked response (SSVEP) is widely used in visual-based
diagnosis and applications such as brain computer interfacing due to its high
information transfer rate and the capability to activate commands through
simple gaze control. However, one major impediment in using flashing visual
stimulus to obtain SSVEP is eye fatigue that prevents continued long term use
preventing practical deployment. This combined with the difficulty in
establishing precise pulse-width modulation (PWM) that results in poorer
accuracy warrants the development of appropriate approach to solve these
issues. Various studies have suggested the usage of high frequencies of visual
stimulus to reduce the visual fatigue for the user but this results in poor
response performance. Here, the authors study the use of extremely high
duty-cycles in the stimulus in the hope of solving these constraints.
Electroencephalogram data was recorded with PWM duty-cycles of 50 to 95%
generated by a precise custom-made light-emitting diode hardware and tested ten
subjects responded that increasing duty-cycles had less visual strain for all
the frequency values and the SSVEP exhibited a subject-independent peak
response for duty-cycle of 85%. This could pave the way for increased usage of
SSVEP for practical applications.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了Poncelet三角形族在嵌套椭圆间的几何特性，特别是垂心和等角共轭点的轨迹规律，以及外接圆和根轴包络的圆锥曲线条件。

Abstract: We prove that over a Poncelet triangle family interscribed between two nested
ellipses $\E,\E_c$, (i) the locus of the orthocenter is not only a conic, but
it is axis-aligned and homothetic to a $90^o$-rotated copy of $\E$, and (ii)
the locus of the isogonal conjugate of a fixed point $P$ is also a conic (the
expected degree was four); a parabola (resp. line) if $P$ is on the
(degree-four) envelope of the circumcircle (resp. on $\E$). We also show that
the envelope of both the circumcircle and radical axis of incircle and
circumcircle contain a conic component if and only if $\E_c$ is a circle. The
former case is the union of two circles!

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在需要推理长帧序列的视频任务中表现不佳，限制了其在具身任务中的应用。

Method: 提出ROVER框架，递归分解视频轨迹为子任务段，结合上下文学习实现局部推理。

Result: 在OpenX Embodiment和RoboCasa数据集上，ROVER在任务进度估计、帧级自然语言推理和视频问答任务中优于基线。

Conclusion: ROVER通过减少每步推理的帧数，缓解幻觉问题，且时间复杂度线性增长，优于基线方法。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities across
diverse image understanding tasks, but still struggle in settings that require
reasoning over extended sequences of camera frames from a video. This limits
their utility in embodied settings, which require reasoning over long frame
sequences from a continuous stream of visual input at each moment of a task
attempt. To address this limitation, we propose ROVER (Reasoning Over VidEo
Recursively), a framework that enables the model to recursively decompose
long-horizon video trajectories into segments corresponding to shorter subtasks
within the trajectory. In doing so, ROVER facilitates more focused and accurate
reasoning over temporally localized frame sequences without losing global
context. We evaluate ROVER, implemented using an in-context learning approach,
on diverse OpenX Embodiment videos and on a new dataset derived from RoboCasa
that consists of 543 videos showing both expert and perturbed non-expert
trajectories across 27 robotic manipulation tasks. ROVER outperforms strong
baselines across three video reasoning tasks: task progress estimation,
frame-level natural language reasoning, and video question answering. We
observe that, by reducing the number of frames the model reasons over at each
timestep, ROVER mitigates hallucinations, especially during unexpected or
non-optimal moments of a trajectory. In addition, by enabling the
implementation of a subtask-specific sliding context window, ROVER's time
complexity scales linearly with video length, an asymptotic improvement over
baselines. Demos, code, and data available at: https://rover-vlm.github.io

Conclusion: QuaDreamer为四足机器人提供了可控、高质量的全景数据生成方案，推动了其感知系统的进步。

Abstract: Panoramic cameras, capturing comprehensive 360-degree environmental data, are
suitable for quadruped robots in surrounding perception and interaction with
complex environments. However, the scarcity of high-quality panoramic training
data-caused by inherent kinematic constraints and complex sensor calibration
challenges-fundamentally limits the development of robust perception systems
tailored to these embodied platforms. To address this issue, we propose
QuaDreamer-the first panoramic data generation engine specifically designed for
quadruped robots. QuaDreamer focuses on mimicking the motion paradigm of
quadruped robots to generate highly controllable, realistic panoramic videos,
providing a data source for downstream tasks. Specifically, to effectively
capture the unique vertical vibration characteristics exhibited during
quadruped locomotion, we introduce Vertical Jitter Encoding (VJE). VJE extracts
controllable vertical signals through frequency-domain feature filtering and
provides high-quality prompts. To facilitate high-quality panoramic video
generation under jitter signal control, we propose a Scene-Object Controller
(SOC) that effectively manages object motion and boosts background jitter
control through the attention mechanism. To address panoramic distortions in
wide-FoV video generation, we propose the Panoramic Enhancer (PE)-a dual-stream
architecture that synergizes frequency-texture refinement for local detail
enhancement with spatial-structure correction for global geometric consistency.
We further demonstrate that the generated video sequences can serve as training
data for the quadruped robot's panoramic visual perception model, enhancing the
performance of multi-object tracking in 360-degree scenes. The source code and
model weights will be publicly available at

Abstract: The global demand for medicinal plants, such as Damask roses, has surged with
population growth, yet labor-intensive harvesting remains a bottleneck for
scalability. To address this, we propose a novel 3D perception pipeline
tailored for flower-harvesting robots, focusing on sparse 3D localization of
rose centers. Our two-stage algorithm first performs 2D point-based detection
on stereo images, followed by depth estimation using a lightweight deep neural
network. To overcome the challenge of scarce real-world labeled data, we
introduce a photorealistic synthetic dataset generated via Blender, simulating
a dynamic rose farm environment with precise 3D annotations. This approach
minimizes manual labeling costs while enabling robust model training. We
evaluate two depth estimation paradigms: a traditional triangulation-based
method and our proposed deep learning framework. Results demonstrate the
superiority of our method, achieving an F1 score of 95.6% (synthetic) and 74.4%
(real) in 2D detection, with a depth estimation error of 3% at a 2-meter range
on synthetic data. The pipeline is optimized for computational efficiency,
ensuring compatibility with resource-constrained robotic systems. By bridging
the domain gap between synthetic and real-world data, this work advances
agricultural automation for specialty crops, offering a scalable solution for

Conclusion: 未来研究应关注改进MTL方法以解决任务冲突、提升性能，并推动CAV系统的实际应用。

Abstract: Connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) must simultaneously perform multiple
tasks, such as object detection, semantic segmentation, depth estimation,
trajectory prediction, motion prediction, and behaviour prediction, to ensure
safe and reliable navigation in complex environments. Vehicle-to-everything
(V2X) communication enables cooperative driving among CAVs, thereby mitigating
the limitations of individual sensors, reducing occlusions, and improving
perception over long distances. Traditionally, these tasks are addressed using
distinct models, which leads to high deployment costs, increased computational
overhead, and challenges in achieving real-time performance. Multi-task
learning (MTL) has recently emerged as a promising solution that enables the
joint learning of multiple tasks within a single unified model. This offers
improved efficiency and resource utilization. To the best of our knowledge,
this survey is the first comprehensive review focused on MTL in the context of
CAVs. We begin with an overview of CAVs and MTL to provide foundational
background. We then explore the application of MTL across key functional
modules, including perception, prediction, planning, control, and multi-agent
collaboration. Finally, we discuss the strengths and limitations of existing
methods, identify key research gaps, and provide directions for future research
aimed at advancing MTL methodologies for CAV systems.

Abstract: Advances in 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis have enabled
efficient, photorealistic rendering, but the data collection process remains
largely manual, making it time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address the
challenges, this study introduces Hierarchical Next-Best-View Exploration for
Systematic Intelligent Autonomous Data Collection (Hestia), which leverages
reinforcement learning to learn a generalizable policy for 5-DoF next-best
viewpoint prediction. Unlike prior approaches, Hestia systematically defines
the next-best-view task by proposing core components such as dataset choice,
observation design, action space, reward calculation, and learning schemes,
forming a foundation for the planner. Hestia goes beyond prior next-best-view
approaches and traditional capture systems through integration and validation
in a real-world setup, where a drone serves as a mobile sensor for active scene
exploration. Experimental results show that Hestia performs robustly across
three datasets and translated object settings in the NVIDIA IsaacLab
environment, and proves feasible for real-world deployment.

hyperspectral imaging for material identification, polarimetric sensing for
surface characterization, and computational imaging with metaphotonics enabling
radical miniaturization; (3) intelligent autonomy through active reconstruction
algorithms, where drones equipped with 3D Gaussian Splatting make strategic
decisions about viewpoint selection to maximize information gain within battery
constraints; and (4) integration pathways with existing property workflows,
including Building Information Modeling (BIM) systems and industry standards
like Uniform Appraisal Dataset (UAD) 3.6.

Abstract: Articulated object recognition -- the task of identifying both the geometry
and kinematic joints of objects with movable parts -- is essential for enabling
robots to interact with everyday objects such as doors and laptops. However,
existing approaches often rely on strong assumptions, such as a known number of
articulated parts; require additional inputs, such as depth images; or involve
complex intermediate steps that can introduce potential errors -- limiting
their practicality in real-world settings. In this paper, we introduce
ScrewSplat, a simple end-to-end method that operates solely on RGB
observations. Our approach begins by randomly initializing screw axes, which
are then iteratively optimized to recover the object's underlying kinematic
structure. By integrating with Gaussian Splatting, we simultaneously
reconstruct the 3D geometry and segment the object into rigid, movable parts.
We demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art recognition accuracy
across a diverse set of articulated objects, and further enables zero-shot,
text-guided manipulation using the recovered kinematic model.

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上表现出更高的准确性和鲁棒性，并在4D雷达SLAM系统中显著提升了定位性能。

Conclusion: 矩匹配技术在稀疏和噪声场景下具有潜力，可替代传统配准方法。

Abstract: Point cloud registration is a key step in robotic perception tasks, such as
Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). It is especially challenging in
conditions with sparse points and heavy noise. Traditional registration
methods, such as Iterative Closest Point (ICP) and Normal Distributions
Transform (NDT), often have difficulties in achieving a robust and accurate
alignment under these conditions. In this paper, we propose a registration
framework based on moment matching. In particular, the point clouds are
regarded as i.i.d. samples drawn from the same distribution observed in the
source and target frames. We then match the generalized Gaussian Radial Basis
moments calculated from the point clouds to estimate the rigid transformation
between two frames. Moreover, such method does not require explicit
point-to-point correspondences among the point clouds. We further show the
consistency of the proposed method. Experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets show that our approach achieves higher accuracy and robustness than
existing methods. In addition, we integrate our framework into a 4D Radar SLAM
system. The proposed method significantly improves the localization performance
and achieves results comparable to LiDAR-based systems. These findings
demonstrate the potential of moment matching technique for robust point cloud
registration in sparse and noisy scenarios.

Abstract: The control of robots for manipulation tasks generally relies on visual
input. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) enable the use of
natural language instructions to condition visual input and control robots in a
wider range of environments. However, existing methods require a large amount
of data to fine-tune VLMs for operating in unseen environments. In this paper,
we present a framework that learns object-arrangement tasks from just a few
demonstrations. We propose a two-stage framework that divides
object-arrangement tasks into a target localization stage, for picking the
object, and a region determination stage for placing the object. We present an
instance-level semantic fusion module that aligns the instance-level image
crops with the text embedding, enabling the model to identify the target
objects defined by the natural language instructions. We validate our method on
both simulation and real-world robotic environments. Our method, fine-tuned
with a few demonstrations, improves generalization capability and demonstrates
zero-shot ability in real-robot manipulation scenarios.

Motivation: 解决不确定性可视化中需要专门方法和复杂计算的障碍，使其更易于应用。

Result: 方法通用性强，适用于标准和非标准案例，如饼图和堆叠条形图，并提供了Python库实现。

Conclusion: 该方法使不确定性可视化更易用，适合教学和实践。

Abstract: Visualizing uncertainty is integral to data analysis, yet its application is
often hindered by the need for specialized methods for quantifying and
representing uncertainty for different types of graphics. We introduce a
general approach that simplifies this process. The core idea is to treat the
statistical graphic as a function of the underlying distribution. Instead of
first calculating uncertainty metrics and then plotting them, the method
propagates uncertainty through to the visualization. By repeatedly sampling
from the data distribution and generating a complete statistical graphic for
each sample, a distribution over graphics is produced. These graphics are
aggregated pixel-by-pixel to create a single, static image. This approach is
versatile, requires no specific knowledge from the user beyond how to create
the basic statistical graphic, and comes with theoretical coverage guarantees
for standard cases such as confidence intervals and bands. We provide a
reference implementation as a Python library to demonstrate the method's
utility. Our approach not only reproduces conventional uncertainty
visualizations for point estimates and regression lines but also seamlessly
extends to non-standard cases, including pie charts, stacked bar charts, and
tables. This approach makes uncertainty visualization more accessible to
practitioners and can be a valuable tool for teaching uncertainty.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经渲染模型在实时性和能效上不足，CIM技术有望解决这些问题。

Method: 提出动态采样和MLP优化算法，设计高效的ReRAM CIM架构。

Result: 实验显示ASDR在渲染任务中速度提升显著，且PSNR损失极小。

Conclusion: ASDR为神经渲染提供了高效、低功耗的解决方案。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) offer significant promise for generating
photorealistic images and videos. However, existing mainstream neural rendering
models often fall short in meeting the demands for immediacy and power
efficiency in practical applications. Specifically, these models frequently
exhibit irregular access patterns and substantial computational overhead,
leading to undesirable inference latency and high power consumption.
Computing-in-memory (CIM), an emerging computational paradigm, has the
potential to address these access bottlenecks and reduce the power consumption
associated with model execution.
  To bridge the gap between model performance and real-world scene
requirements, we propose an algorithm-architecture co-design approach,
abbreviated as ASDR, a CIM-based accelerator supporting efficient neural
rendering. At the algorithmic level, we propose two rendering optimization
schemes: (1) Dynamic sampling by online sensing of the rendering difficulty of
different pixels, thus reducing access memory and computational overhead. (2)
Reducing MLP overhead by decoupling and approximating the volume rendering of
color and density. At the architecture level, we design an efficient
ReRAM-based CIM architecture with efficient data mapping and reuse
microarchitecture. Experiments demonstrate that our design can achieve up to
$9.55\times$ and $69.75\times$ speedup over state-of-the-art NeRF accelerators
and Xavier NX GPU in graphics rendering tasks with only $0.1$ PSNR loss.

Motivation: 医疗领域中的公平性问题（如服务获取和结果不平等）亟待解决，而现有联邦学习方法在医疗数据上的表现不佳且忽视公平性。

Method: 提出了FairLoRA框架，通过为不同人口群体定制奇异值矩阵（共享奇异向量）来平衡公平性和效率。

Result: 在FairFedMed数据集上，FairLoRA在医疗图像分类中表现优异，并显著提升了跨人口群体的公平性。

Conclusion: FairLoRA为医疗联邦学习提供了公平性和性能的平衡解决方案，FairFedMed数据集为未来研究提供了基准。

Abstract: Fairness remains a critical concern in healthcare, where unequal access to
services and treatment outcomes can adversely affect patient health. While
Federated Learning (FL) presents a collaborative and privacy-preserving
approach to model training, ensuring fairness is challenging due to
heterogeneous data across institutions, and current research primarily
addresses non-medical applications. To fill this gap, we establish the first
experimental benchmark for fairness in medical FL, evaluating six
representative FL methods across diverse demographic attributes and imaging
modalities. We introduce FairFedMed, the first medical FL dataset specifically
designed to study group fairness (i.e., demographics). It comprises two parts:
FairFedMed-Oph, featuring 2D fundus and 3D OCT ophthalmology samples with six
demographic attributes; and FairFedMed-Chest, which simulates real
cross-institutional FL using subsets of CheXpert and MIMIC-CXR. Together, they
support both simulated and real-world FL across diverse medical modalities and
demographic groups. Existing FL models often underperform on medical images and
overlook fairness across demographic groups. To address this, we propose
FairLoRA, a fairness-aware FL framework based on SVD-based low-rank
approximation. It customizes singular value matrices per demographic group
while sharing singular vectors, ensuring both fairness and efficiency.
Experimental results on the FairFedMed dataset demonstrate that FairLoRA not
only achieves state-of-the-art performance in medical image classification but
also significantly improves fairness across diverse populations. Our code and
dataset can be accessible via link: https://wang.hms.harvard.edu/fairfedmed/.

Result: 在图像分类任务中，RKD-SC显著减少了模型参数，同时保持了教师模型的高性能，并表现出优于现有方法的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RKD-SC框架为高效且鲁棒的语义通信提供了一种可行解决方案。

Abstract: Large-scale models (LSMs) can be an effective framework for semantic
representation and understanding, thereby providing a suitable tool for
designing semantic communication (SC) systems. However, their direct deployment
is often hindered by high computational complexity and resource requirements.
In this paper, a novel robust knowledge distillation based semantic
communication (RKD-SC) framework is proposed to enable efficient and
\textcolor{black}{channel-noise-robust} LSM-powered SC. The framework addresses
two key challenges: determining optimal compact model architectures and
effectively transferring knowledge while maintaining robustness against channel
noise. First, a knowledge distillation-based lightweight differentiable
architecture search (KDL-DARTS) algorithm is proposed. This algorithm
integrates knowledge distillation loss and a complexity penalty into the neural
architecture search process to identify high-performance, lightweight semantic
encoder architectures. Second, a novel two-stage robust knowledge distillation
(RKD) algorithm is developed to transfer semantic capabilities from an LSM
(teacher) to a compact encoder (student) and subsequently enhance system
robustness. To further improve resilience to channel impairments, a
channel-aware transformer (CAT) block is introduced as the channel codec,
trained under diverse channel conditions with variable-length outputs.
Extensive simulations on image classification tasks demonstrate that the RKD-SC
framework significantly reduces model parameters while preserving a high degree
of the teacher model's performance and exhibiting superior robustness compared
to existing methods.

Conclusion: XAI方法需针对神经影像数据进行适应性调整，现有研究结果需重新评估，SmoothGrad是更可靠的选择。

Abstract: Trustworthy interpretation of deep learning models is critical for
neuroimaging applications, yet commonly used Explainable AI (XAI) methods lack
rigorous validation, risking misinterpretation. We performed the first
large-scale, systematic comparison of XAI methods on ~45,000 structural brain
MRIs using a novel XAI validation framework. This framework establishes
verifiable ground truth by constructing prediction tasks with known signal
sources - from localized anatomical features to subject-specific clinical
lesions - without artificially altering input images. Our analysis reveals
systematic failures in two of the most widely used methods: GradCAM
consistently failed to localize predictive features, while Layer-wise Relevance
Propagation generated extensive, artifactual explanations that suggest
incompatibility with neuroimaging data characteristics. Our results indicate
that these failures stem from a domain mismatch, where methods with design
principles tailored to natural images require substantial adaptation for
neuroimaging data. In contrast, the simpler, gradient-based method SmoothGrad,
which makes fewer assumptions about data structure, proved consistently
accurate, suggesting its conceptual simplicity makes it more robust to this
domain shift. These findings highlight the need for domain-specific adaptation
and validation of XAI methods, suggest that interpretations from prior
neuroimaging studies using standard XAI methodology warrant re-evaluation, and
provide urgent guidance for practical application of XAI in neuroimaging.

Conclusion: FRA框架和SDSN算法有效解决了图匹配中的松弛问题，混合精度架构进一步提升了计算效率。

Abstract: Graph matching, typically formulated as a Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP),
seeks to establish node correspondences between two graphs. To address the
NP-hardness of QAP, some existing methods adopt projection-based relaxations
that embed the problem into the convex hull of the discrete domain. However,
these relaxations inevitably enlarge the feasible set, introducing two sources
of error: numerical scale sensitivity and geometric misalignment between the
relaxed and original domains. To alleviate these errors, we propose a novel
relaxation framework by reformulating the projection step as a
Frobenius-regularized Linear Assignment (FRA) problem, where a tunable
regularization term mitigates feasible region inflation. This formulation
enables normalization-based operations to preserve numerical scale invariance
without compromising accuracy. To efficiently solve FRA, we propose the Scaling
Doubly Stochastic Normalization (SDSN) algorithm. Building on its favorable
computational properties, we develop a theoretically grounded mixed-precision
architecture to achieve substantial acceleration. Comprehensive CPU-based
benchmarks demonstrate that FRAM consistently outperforms all baseline methods
under identical precision settings. When combined with a GPU-based
mixed-precision architecture, FRAM achieves up to 370X speedup over its
CPU-FP64 counterpart, with negligible loss in solution accuracy.

Result: IMU在视觉和语言任务中表现优于现有无需保留集的方法。

Conclusion: IMU是一种简单有效的机器遗忘方法，显著提升了遗忘效果并保持模型性能。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that deep learning models are vulnerable to attacks
and tend to memorize training data points, raising significant concerns about
privacy leakage. This motivates the development of machine unlearning (MU),
i.e., a paradigm that enables models to selectively forget specific data points
upon request. However, most existing MU algorithms require partial or full
fine-tuning on the retain set. This necessitates continued access to the
original training data, which is often impractical due to privacy concerns and
storage constraints. A few retain-data-free MU methods have been proposed, but
some rely on access to auxiliary data and precomputed statistics of the retain
set, while others scale poorly when forgetting larger portions of data. In this
paper, we propose Influence-guided Machine Unlearning (IMU), a simple yet
effective method that conducts MU using only the forget set. Specifically, IMU
employs gradient ascent and innovatively introduces dynamic allocation of
unlearning intensities across different data points based on their influences.
This adaptive strategy significantly enhances unlearning effectiveness while
maintaining model utility. Results across vision and language tasks demonstrate
that IMU consistently outperforms existing retain-data-free MU methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in conditional generative modeling have introduced Continuous
conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CcGAN) and Continuous Conditional
Diffusion Model (CCDM) for estimating high-dimensional data distributions
conditioned on scalar, continuous regression labels (e.g., angles, ages, or
temperatures). However, these approaches face fundamental limitations: CcGAN
suffers from data imbalance due to fixed-size vicinity constraints, while CCDM
requires computationally expensive iterative sampling. We present CcGAN-AVAR,
an enhanced CcGAN framework that addresses both challenges: (1) leveraging the
GAN framework's native one-step generation to overcome CCDMs' sampling
bottleneck (achieving 300x-2000x faster inference), while (2) two novel
components specifically target data imbalance - an adaptive vicinity mechanism
that dynamically adjusts vicinity's size, and a multi-task discriminator that
constructs two regularization terms (through auxiliary regression and density
ratio estimation) to significantly improve generator training. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark datasets (64x64 to 192x192 resolution) across
eight challenging imbalanced settings demonstrate that CcGAN-AVAR achieves
state-of-the-art generation quality while maintaining sampling efficiency.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is fundamental to diverse applications, with recent
approaches leverage large vision models (LVMs) to capture temporal patterns
through visual representations. We reveal that while vision models enhance
forecasting performance, 99% of their parameters are unnecessary for time
series tasks. Through cross-modal analysis, we find that time series align with
low-level textural features but not high-level semantics, which can impair
forecasting accuracy. We propose OccamVTS, a knowledge distillation framework
that extracts only the essential 1% of predictive information from LVMs into
lightweight networks. Using pre-trained LVMs as privileged teachers, OccamVTS
employs pyramid-style feature alignment combined with correlation and feature
distillation to transfer beneficial patterns while filtering out semantic
noise. Counterintuitively, this aggressive parameter reduction improves
accuracy by eliminating overfitting to irrelevant visual features while
preserving essential temporal patterns. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate that OccamVTS consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance with only 1% of the original parameters,
particularly excelling in few-shot and zero-shot scenarios.

Abstract: Noisy labels pose a common challenge for training accurate deep neural
networks. To mitigate label noise, prior studies have proposed various robust
loss functions to achieve noise tolerance in the presence of label noise,
particularly symmetric losses. However, they usually suffer from the
underfitting issue due to the overly strict symmetric condition. In this work,
we propose a simple yet effective approach for relaxing the symmetric
condition, namely $\epsilon$-softmax, which simply modifies the outputs of the
softmax layer to approximate one-hot vectors with a controllable error
$\epsilon$. Essentially, $\epsilon$-softmax not only acts as an alternative for
the softmax layer, but also implicitly plays the crucial role in modifying the
loss function. We prove theoretically that $\epsilon$-softmax can achieve
noise-tolerant learning with controllable excess risk bound for almost any loss
function. Recognizing that $\epsilon$-softmax-enhanced losses may slightly
reduce fitting ability on clean datasets, we further incorporate them with one
symmetric loss, thereby achieving a better trade-off between robustness and
effective learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our
method in mitigating synthetic and real-world label noise. The code is
available at https://github.com/cswjl/eps-softmax.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽略了临床专家在标注医学图像时的不确定性，导致标签噪声。

Method: 研究了临床专家不确定性对标签噪声的影响，并提出了一种不确定性感知的标签平滑方法。

Result: 提出的方法显著优于当前最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 通过考虑专家不确定性，可以有效减少标签噪声并提升模型性能。

Abstract: Many previous studies have proposed extracting image labels from clinical
notes to create large-scale medical image datasets at a low cost. However,
these approaches inherently suffer from label noise due to uncertainty from the
clinical experts. When radiologists and physicians analyze medical images to
make diagnoses, they often include uncertainty-aware notes such as ``maybe'' or
``not excluded''. Unfortunately, current text-mining methods overlook these
nuances, resulting in the creation of noisy labels. Existing methods for
handling noisy labels in medical image analysis, which typically address the
problem through post-processing techniques, have largely ignored the important
issue of expert-driven uncertainty contributing to label noise. To better
incorporate the expert-written uncertainty in clinical notes into medical image
analysis and address the label noise issue, we first examine the impact of
clinical expert uncertainty on label noise. We then propose a clinical expert
uncertainty-aware benchmark, along with a label smoothing method, which
significantly improves performance compared to current state-of-the-art
approaches.

TL;DR: SURE-Med是一个统一框架，通过视觉、分布和上下文三个维度减少不确定性，提升医学报告生成的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学报告生成中的视觉、标签分布和上下文不确定性，提高临床可信度。

Method: 使用Frontal-Aware View Repair Resampling模块纠正视觉错误，Token Sensitive Learning目标优化标签分布，Contextual Evidence Filter验证上下文信息。

Result: 在MIMIC-CXR和IU-Xray基准测试中表现优异，达到最新技术水平。

Conclusion: SURE-Med通过多维度减少不确定性，为医学报告生成设定了新的可靠性标准。

Abstract: Automated medical report generation (MRG) holds great promise for reducing
the heavy workload of radiologists. However, its clinical deployment is
hindered by three major sources of uncertainty. First, visual uncertainty,
caused by noisy or incorrect view annotations, compromises feature extraction.
Second, label distribution uncertainty, stemming from long-tailed disease
prevalence, biases models against rare but clinically critical conditions.
Third, contextual uncertainty, introduced by unverified historical reports,
often leads to factual hallucinations. These challenges collectively limit the
reliability and clinical trustworthiness of MRG systems. To address these
issues, we propose SURE-Med, a unified framework that systematically reduces
uncertainty across three critical dimensions: visual, distributional, and
contextual. To mitigate visual uncertainty, a Frontal-Aware View Repair
Resampling module corrects view annotation errors and adaptively selects
informative features from supplementary views. To tackle label distribution
uncertainty, we introduce a Token Sensitive Learning objective that enhances
the modeling of critical diagnostic sentences while reweighting
underrepresented diagnostic terms, thereby improving sensitivity to infrequent
conditions. To reduce contextual uncertainty, our Contextual Evidence Filter
validates and selectively incorporates prior information that aligns with the
current image, effectively suppressing hallucinations. Extensive experiments on
the MIMIC-CXR and IU-Xray benchmarks demonstrate that SURE-Med achieves
state-of-the-art performance. By holistically reducing uncertainty across
multiple input modalities, SURE-Med sets a new benchmark for reliability in
medical report generation and offers a robust step toward trustworthy clinical
decision support.

TL;DR: VibeMesh是一种新型可穿戴系统，结合视觉和主动声学传感，用于高精度手部姿势和接触估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于视觉遮挡、细微接触信号、仅依赖视觉的传感限制以及缺乏灵活触觉传感，准确估计手部姿势和接触事件具有挑战性。

Method: VibeMesh集成骨传导扬声器和稀疏压电麦克风，通过结构化声学信号传播推断接触变化，并提出基于图的注意力网络处理多模态信号。

Result: VibeMesh在遮挡或静态接触场景中表现优于仅依赖视觉的基线方法。

Conclusion: VibeMesh提供了一种轻量级、非侵入式的多模态传感解决方案，显著提升了手部姿势和接触估计的精度和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurately estimating hand pose and hand-object contact events is essential
for robot data-collection, immersive virtual environments, and biomechanical
analysis, yet remains challenging due to visual occlusion, subtle contact cues,
limitations in vision-only sensing, and the lack of accessible and flexible
tactile sensing. We therefore introduce VibeMesh, a novel wearable system that
fuses vision with active acoustic sensing for dense, per-vertex hand contact
and pose estimation. VibeMesh integrates a bone-conduction speaker and sparse
piezoelectric microphones, distributed on a human hand, emitting structured
acoustic signals and capturing their propagation to infer changes induced by
contact. To interpret these cross-modal signals, we propose a graph-based
attention network that processes synchronized audio spectra and RGB-D-derived
hand meshes to predict contact with high spatial resolution. We contribute: (i)
a lightweight, non-intrusive visuo-acoustic sensing platform; (ii) a
cross-modal graph network for joint pose and contact inference; (iii) a dataset
of synchronized RGB-D, acoustic, and ground-truth contact annotations across
diverse manipulation scenarios; and (iv) empirical results showing that
VibeMesh outperforms vision-only baselines in accuracy and robustness,
particularly in occluded or static-contact settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AR中虚拟物体缺乏物理性导致声音交互不自然，现有方法无法动态适应新场景和物体，影响了多感官体验的真实感。

Method: 利用计算机视觉识别和分割真实物体的材料，结合物理建模合成实时生成基于材料的声音。

Result: 用户研究表明，基于材料的声音显著提升了交互的真实感和材料辨识的准确性。

Conclusion: 上下文感知的材料声音交互增强了AR的真实感和对现实环境的感知。

Abstract: In Augmented Reality (AR), virtual objects interact with real objects.
However, the lack of physicality of virtual objects leads to the absence of
natural sonic interactions. When virtual and real objects collide, either no
sound or a generic sound is played. Both lead to an incongruent multisensory
experience, reducing interaction and object realism. Unlike in Virtual Reality
(VR) and games, where predefined scenes and interactions allow for the playback
of pre-recorded sound samples, AR requires real-time sound synthesis that
dynamically adapts to novel contexts and objects to provide audiovisual
congruence during interaction. To enhance real-virtual object interactions in
AR, we propose a framework for context-aware sounds using methods from computer
vision to recognize and segment the materials of real objects. The material's
physical properties and the impact dynamics of the interaction are used to
generate material-based sounds in real-time using physical modelling synthesis.
In a user study with 24 participants, we compared our congruent material-based
sounds to a generic sound effect, mirroring the current standard of
non-context-aware sounds in AR applications. The results showed that
material-based sounds led to significantly more realistic sonic interactions.
Material-based sounds also enabled participants to distinguish visually similar
materials with significantly greater accuracy and confidence. These findings
show that context-aware, material-based sonic interactions in AR foster a
stronger sense of realism and enhance our perception of real-world
surroundings.

Result: 跨用户预测准确率达到84.5%，接近用户内预测的85.5%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了灵活性，适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: For machines to effectively assist humans in challenging visual search tasks,
they must differentiate whether a human is simply glancing into a scene
(navigational intent) or searching for a target object (informational intent).
Previous research proposed combining electroencephalography (EEG) and
eye-tracking measurements to recognize such search intents implicitly, i.e.,
without explicit user input. However, the applicability of these approaches to
real-world scenarios suffers from two key limitations. First, previous work
used fixed search times in the informational intent condition -- a stark
contrast to visual search, which naturally terminates when the target is found.
Second, methods incorporating EEG measurements addressed prediction scenarios
that require ground truth training data from the target user, which is
impractical in many use cases. We address these limitations by making the first
publicly available EEG and eye-tracking dataset for navigational vs.
informational intent recognition, where the user determines search times. We
present the first method for cross-user prediction of search intents from EEG
and eye-tracking recordings and reach 84.5% accuracy in leave-one-user-out
evaluations -- comparable to within-user prediction accuracy (85.5%) but
offering much greater flexibility

Conclusion: HESCAPE为空间转录组学提供了标准化数据集和评估工具，强调了批次鲁棒多模态学习方法的重要性。

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics enables simultaneous measurement of gene expression
and tissue morphology, offering unprecedented insights into cellular
organization and disease mechanisms. However, the field lacks comprehensive
benchmarks for evaluating multimodal learning methods that leverage both
histology images and gene expression data. Here, we present HESCAPE, a
large-scale benchmark for cross-modal contrastive pretraining in spatial
transcriptomics, built on a curated pan-organ dataset spanning 6 different gene
panels and 54 donors. We systematically evaluated state-of-the-art image and
gene expression encoders across multiple pretraining strategies and assessed
their effectiveness on two downstream tasks: gene mutation classification and
gene expression prediction. Our benchmark demonstrates that gene expression
encoders are the primary determinant of strong representational alignment, and
that gene models pretrained on spatial transcriptomics data outperform both
those trained without spatial data and simple baseline approaches. However,
downstream task evaluation reveals a striking contradiction: while contrastive
pretraining consistently improves gene mutation classification performance, it
degrades direct gene expression prediction compared to baseline encoders
trained without cross-modal objectives. We identify batch effects as a key
factor that interferes with effective cross-modal alignment. Our findings
highlight the critical need for batch-robust multimodal learning approaches in
spatial transcriptomics. To accelerate progress in this direction, we release
HESCAPE, providing standardized datasets, evaluation protocols, and
benchmarking tools for the community
