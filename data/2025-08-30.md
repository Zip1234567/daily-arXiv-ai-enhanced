### [1] [VSF: Simple, Efficient, and Effective Negative Guidance in Few-Step Image Generation Models By Value Sign Flip](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10931)
*Wenqi Guo,Shan Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VSF是一种简单高效的负向提示引导方法，通过翻转注意力值符号来抑制不需要的内容，在少步扩散和流匹配模型中表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如CFG、NASA和NAG在负向提示引导方面存在不足，需要一种更高效且计算开销小的解决方案

Method: 动态翻转负向提示的注意力值符号，通过简单的符号操作来抑制不需要的内容生成

Result: 在复杂提示对数据集上验证，VSF在静态图像和视频生成任务中均表现出色，显著提升了负向提示的遵循度

Conclusion: VSF是一种计算高效、易于集成的负向提示引导方法，在少步模型中优于现有技术，甚至在某些情况下超越CFG

Abstract: We introduce Value Sign Flip (VSF), a simple and efficient method for
incorporating negative prompt guidance in few-step diffusion and flow-matching
image generation models. Unlike existing approaches such as classifier-free
guidance (CFG), NASA, and NAG, VSF dynamically suppresses undesired content by
flipping the sign of attention values from negative prompts. Our method
requires only small computational overhead and integrates effectively with
MMDiT-style architectures such as Stable Diffusion 3.5 Turbo, as well as
cross-attention-based models like Wan. We validate VSF on challenging datasets
with complex prompt pairs and demonstrate superior performance in both static
image and video generation tasks. Experimental results show that VSF
significantly improves negative prompt adherence compared to prior methods in
few-step models, and even CFG in non-few-step models, while maintaining
competitive image quality. Code and ComfyUI node are available in
https://github.com/weathon/VSF/tree/main.

### [2] [Mitigating Hallucinations in Multimodal LLMs via Object-aware Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20181)
*Alberto Compagnoni,Davide Caffagni,Nicholas Moratelli,Lorenzo Baraldi,Marcella Cornia,Rita Cucchiara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CHAIR-DPO方法，通过CHAIR指标构建偏好数据，使用DPO算法微调MLLMs以减少幻觉问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型存在严重的幻觉问题，即生成与视觉输入不符的答案，需要有效的对齐方法来减少幻觉

Method: 利用CHAIR指标自动区分幻觉和非幻觉样本对，通过Direct Preference Optimization直接微调现有多模态大语言模型

Result: 在多个幻觉基准测试上有效减少了幻觉答案的数量，证明了基于CHAIR奖励的微调效果

Conclusion: CHAIR-DPO提供了一种简单有效的MLLM对齐方法，无需复杂流水线或专有模型，就能显著降低幻觉率

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) emerge as a unified interface to
address a multitude of tasks, ranging from NLP to computer vision. Despite
showcasing state-of-the-art results in many benchmarks, a long-standing issue
is the tendency of MLLMs to hallucinate, that is to generate answers to the
user's query that are not reflected in the visual input. In this paper, we
address the problem of hallucinations as an alignment problem, seeking to steer
the MLLM so that it prefers generating content without hallucinations. In
contrast to recent approaches that require complicated pipelines to build
synthetic preference data for alignment training, often relying on proprietary
models, we capitalize on the well-known CHAIR metric, originally proposed to
gauge the degree of hallucinations in image captioning. Given a pair of
generated answers, we leverage CHAIR to distinguish winner and loser options
(i.e., non-hallucinated and hallucinated samples) and fine-tune off-the-shelf
MLLMs via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The resulting method, which we
refer to as CHAIR-DPO, effectively diminishes the amount of hallucinated
answers on several hallucination benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of
fine-tuning the MLLM with a CHAIR-based reward. Source code and trained models
are publicly available at https://github.com/aimagelab/CHAIR-DPO.

### [3] [SDiFL: Stable Diffusion-Driven Framework for Image Forgery Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20182)
*Yang Su,Shunquan Tan,Jiwu Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于Stable Diffusion 3的多模态框架，通过将伪造残差作为显式模态融入潜空间，实现了更高效准确的图像伪造定位方法，在多个数据集上较现有方法提升12%，并具有良好的过逆推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像伪造定位方法依赖人工标注数据，成本高且难以跟上新兴多模态大模型带来的图像编辑技术挑战。

Method: 利用Stable Diffusion 3的多模态处理能力，将高速滤波器提取的图像伪造残差作为显式模态融入潜空间，在保留SD3潜层特征的同时增强伪造定位性能。

Result: 在广泛使用的标准数据集上较现有最优方法提升了12%的性能，对训练未见的真实文档伪造图像和自然场景伪造图像都表现出强劲的造假检测能力。

Conclusion: 该框架成功将SD的图像生成和感知能力集成到图像伪造检测中，为应对新一代多模态大模型带来的图像伪造挑战提供了更高效准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Driven by the new generation of multi-modal large models, such as Stable
Diffusion (SD), image manipulation technologies have advanced rapidly, posing
significant challenges to image forensics. However, existing image forgery
localization methods, which heavily rely on labor-intensive and costly
annotated data, are struggling to keep pace with these emerging image
manipulation technologies. To address these challenges, we are the first to
integrate both image generation and powerful perceptual capabilities of SD into
an image forensic framework, enabling more efficient and accurate forgery
localization. First, we theoretically show that the multi-modal architecture of
SD can be conditioned on forgery-related information, enabling the model to
inherently output forgery localization results. Then, building on this
foundation, we specifically leverage the multimodal framework of Stable
DiffusionV3 (SD3) to enhance forgery localization performance.We leverage the
multi-modal processing capabilities of SD3 in the latent space by treating
image forgery residuals -- high-frequency signals extracted using specific
highpass filters -- as an explicit modality. This modality is fused into the
latent space during training to enhance forgery localization performance.
Notably, our method fully preserves the latent features extracted by SD3,
thereby retaining the rich semantic information of the input image.
Experimental results show that our framework achieves up to 12% improvements in
performance on widely used benchmarking datasets compared to current
state-of-the-art image forgery localization models. Encouragingly, the model
demonstrates strong performance on forensic tasks involving real-world document
forgery images and natural scene forging images, even when such data were
entirely unseen during training.

### [4] [Grounding Multimodal Large Language Models with Quantitative Skin Attributes: A Retrieval Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20188)
*Max Torop,Masih Eskandar,Nicholas Kurtansky,Jinyang Liu,Jochen Weber,Octavia Camps,Veronica Rotemberg,Jennifer Dy,Kivanc Kose*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究探索将多模态大语言模型与定量属性相结合，通过微调使模型能够从图像预测皮肤病变属性值，从而提高AI皮肤疾病诊断模型的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然AI模型在皮肤疾病诊断方面表现出色，但模型预测的可解释性不足限制了其临床实际应用。需要找到方法来提高诊断决策的透明度。

Method: 结合多模态大语言模型和定量属性分析，通过微调使模型能够从图像预测病变属性值（如病变面积），并在SLICE-3D数据集上进行基于内容的图像检索案例研究。

Result: 研究表明MLLM嵌入空间可以基于定量属性进行接地，模型能够成功预测与病变外观相关的定量属性值。

Conclusion: 通过将MLLM与定量属性相结合，可以为皮肤疾病诊断AI模型提供更可解释的推理过程，为临床实践应用铺平道路。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence models have demonstrated significant success in
diagnosing skin diseases, including cancer, showing the potential to assist
clinicians in their analysis. However, the interpretability of model
predictions must be significantly improved before they can be used in practice.
To this end, we explore the combination of two promising approaches: Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) and quantitative attribute usage. MLLMs offer a
potential avenue for increased interpretability, providing reasoning for
diagnosis in natural language through an interactive format. Separately, a
number of quantitative attributes that are related to lesion appearance (e.g.,
lesion area) have recently been found predictive of malignancy with high
accuracy. Predictions grounded as a function of such concepts have the
potential for improved interpretability. We provide evidence that MLLM
embedding spaces can be grounded in such attributes, through fine-tuning to
predict their values from images. Concretely, we evaluate this grounding in the
embedding space through an attribute-specific content-based image retrieval
case study using the SLICE-3D dataset.

### [5] [Enhancing Automatic Modulation Recognition With a Reconstruction-Driven Vision Transformer Under Limited Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20193)
*Hossein Ahmadi,Banafsheh Saffari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于Vision Transformer的统一框架，整合监督、自监督和重建目标，在低标签条件下实现自动调制识别的优异性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动调制识别解决方案依赖大量标注数据或多阶段训练流程，限制了实际应用中的可扩展性和泛化能力

Method: 使用ViT编码器、轻量级卷积解码器和线性分类器，通过重建分支将增强信号映射回原始信号，在预训练中学习鲁棒特征，在微调中使用部分标签监督

Result: 在RML2018.01A数据集上，低标签条件下优于监督CNN和ViT基线，仅用15-20%标注数据即可达到ResNet水平精度，在不同SNR水平下保持强性能

Conclusion: 该框架为自动调制识别提供了简单、可泛化且标签高效的解决方案

Abstract: Automatic modulation recognition (AMR) is critical for cognitive radio,
spectrum monitoring, and secure wireless communication. However, existing
solutions often rely on large labeled datasets or multi-stage training
pipelines, which limit scalability and generalization in practice. We propose a
unified Vision Transformer (ViT) framework that integrates supervised,
self-supervised, and reconstruction objectives. The model combines a ViT
encoder, a lightweight convolutional decoder, and a linear classifier; the
reconstruction branch maps augmented signals back to their originals, anchoring
the encoder to fine-grained I/Q structure. This strategy promotes robust,
discriminative feature learning during pretraining, while partial label
supervision in fine-tuning enables effective classification with limited
labels. On the RML2018.01A dataset, our approach outperforms supervised CNN and
ViT baselines in low-label regimes, approaches ResNet-level accuracy with only
15-20% labeled data, and maintains strong performance across varying SNR
levels. Overall, the framework provides a simple, generalizable, and
label-efficient solution for AMR.

### [6] [InfinityHuman: Towards Long-Term Audio-Driven Human](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20210)
*Xiaodi Li,Pan Xie,Yi Ren,Qijun Gan,Chen Zhang,Fangyuan Kong,Xiang Yin,Bingyue Peng,Zehuan Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfinityHuman是一个从粗到细的音频驱动人体动画框架，通过姿态引导的细化器和手部特定奖励机制，解决了现有方法中的身份漂移、颜色偏移和手部运动失真问题，实现了高质量、长时长的视频生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频驱动人体动画方法在生成高分辨率、长时长视频时存在身份漂移、颜色偏移、场景不稳定和手部运动建模不佳的问题，需要一种能够保持外观一致性并生成自然手部动作的解决方案。

Method: 提出coarse-to-fine框架：首先生成音频同步表示，然后使用姿态引导的细化器逐步细化为高分辨率长视频。利用解耦的姿态序列和初始帧作为视觉锚点减少漂移，并引入手部特定奖励机制提升手势真实感。

Result: 在EMTD和HDTF数据集上的实验表明，InfinityHuman在视频质量、身份保持、手部准确性和唇部同步方面达到了最先进的性能，消融研究证实了各模块的有效性。

Conclusion: InfinityHuman通过稳定的姿态引导和手部奖励机制，成功解决了音频驱动动画中的关键挑战，为生成高质量长时长人体动画提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Audio-driven human animation has attracted wide attention thanks to its
practical applications. However, critical challenges remain in generating
high-resolution, long-duration videos with consistent appearance and natural
hand motions. Existing methods extend videos using overlapping motion frames
but suffer from error accumulation, leading to identity drift, color shifts,
and scene instability. Additionally, hand movements are poorly modeled,
resulting in noticeable distortions and misalignment with the audio. In this
work, we propose InfinityHuman, a coarse-to-fine framework that first generates
audio-synchronized representations, then progressively refines them into
high-resolution, long-duration videos using a pose-guided refiner. Since pose
sequences are decoupled from appearance and resist temporal degradation, our
pose-guided refiner employs stable poses and the initial frame as a visual
anchor to reduce drift and improve lip synchronization. Moreover, to enhance
semantic accuracy and gesture realism, we introduce a hand-specific reward
mechanism trained with high-quality hand motion data. Experiments on the EMTD
and HDTF datasets show that InfinityHuman achieves state-of-the-art performance
in video quality, identity preservation, hand accuracy, and lip-sync. Ablation
studies further confirm the effectiveness of each module. Code will be made
public.

### [7] [Spherical Vision Transformers for Audio-Visual Saliency Prediction in 360-Degree Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20221)
*Mert Cokelek,Halit Ozsoy,Nevrez Imamoglu,Cagri Ozcinar,Inci Ayhan,Erkut Erdem,Aykut Erdem*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了两种新的全向视频显著性预测模型SalViT360和SalViT360-AV，通过结合视觉和空间音频线索，在360度环境中显著提升了观众注意力预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏全面的360度音视频显著性预测数据集，且全向视频的球面扭曲和空间音频集成带来新的挑战，需要开发新的方法来预测视觉显著性。

Method: 构建了YT360-EyeTracking数据集（81个ODV视频），提出SalViT360（基于视觉Transformer的模型，包含球面几何感知空间时间注意力层）和SalViT360-AV（在SalViT360基础上通过Transformer适配器集成音频输入）两种显著性预测模型。

Result: 在多个标准数据集上评测，SalViT360和SalViT360-AV显著超过现有方法。结果显示集成空间音频线索对全向视频的准确显著性预测至关重要。

Conclusion: 空间音频线索的集成对全向视频显著性预测至关重要，新提出的模型能够有效利用音视觉多模态信息预测360度环境中的视觉显著性。

Abstract: Omnidirectional videos (ODVs) are redefining viewer experiences in virtual
reality (VR) by offering an unprecedented full field-of-view (FOV). This study
extends the domain of saliency prediction to 360-degree environments,
addressing the complexities of spherical distortion and the integration of
spatial audio. Contextually, ODVs have transformed user experience by adding a
spatial audio dimension that aligns sound direction with the viewer's
perspective in spherical scenes. Motivated by the lack of comprehensive
datasets for 360-degree audio-visual saliency prediction, our study curates
YT360-EyeTracking, a new dataset of 81 ODVs, each observed under varying
audio-visual conditions. Our goal is to explore how to utilize audio-visual
cues to effectively predict visual saliency in 360-degree videos. Towards this
aim, we propose two novel saliency prediction models: SalViT360, a
vision-transformer-based framework for ODVs equipped with spherical
geometry-aware spatio-temporal attention layers, and SalViT360-AV, which
further incorporates transformer adapters conditioned on audio input. Our
results on a number of benchmark datasets, including our YT360-EyeTracking,
demonstrate that SalViT360 and SalViT360-AV significantly outperform existing
methods in predicting viewer attention in 360-degree scenes. Interpreting these
results, we suggest that integrating spatial audio cues in the model
architecture is crucial for accurate saliency prediction in omnidirectional
videos. Code and dataset will be available at
https://cyberiada.github.io/SalViT360.

### [8] [A Novel Framework for Automated Explain Vision Model Using Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20227)
*Phu-Vinh Nguyen,Tan-Hanh Pham,Chris Ngo,Truong Son Hy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于视觉-语言模型的解释性人工智能管道，用于在样本和数据集层面解释视觉模型的一般行为，发现失败案例并提高模型可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉模型开发主要关注性能指标（如准确率、IoU、mAP），而忽视了可解释性。现有xAI方法多仅解释单个样本，缺乏能够揭示模型在大规模数据集上一般行为的方法，而这对防止偏见判断和理解模型趋势至关重要。

Method: 利用视觉-语言模型构建了一个解释性管道，能够同时在样本级别和数据集级别上解释视觉模型的行为。该管道通过大规模数据分析来揭示模型的整体模式和趋势。

Result: 该方法能够以最小化的努力发现视觉模型的失败案例，并提供深入的模型见解。通过将视觉模型开发与xAI分析相结合，推动了图像分析领域的进步。

Conclusion: 本研究提出的解释性管道有效解决了视觉模型在大规模数据集上行为解释的空白，为预防模型偏见、识别模型模式提供了新方法，并促进了视觉模型开发与xAI分析的集成。

Abstract: The development of many vision models mainly focuses on improving their
performance using metrics such as accuracy, IoU, and mAP, with less attention
to explainability due to the complexity of applying xAI methods to provide a
meaningful explanation of trained models. Although many existing xAI methods
aim to explain vision models sample-by-sample, methods explaining the general
behavior of vision models, which can only be captured after running on a large
dataset, are still underexplored. Furthermore, understanding the behavior of
vision models on general images can be very important to prevent biased
judgments and help identify the model's trends and patterns. With the
application of Vision-Language Models, this paper proposes a pipeline to
explain vision models at both the sample and dataset levels. The proposed
pipeline can be used to discover failure cases and gain insights into vision
models with minimal effort, thereby integrating vision model development with
xAI analysis to advance image analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ATMS-KD框架通过自适应温度调度和混合样本增强，将MobileNetV3 Large教师模型的知识蒸馏到轻量级CNN学生模型，在农业图像分类任务中显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对农业资源受限环境开发轻量级CNN模型的需求，传统知识蒸馏方法在农业计算机视觉应用中效果有限，需要更有效的知识迁移方法。

Method: 结合自适应温度调度和混合样本增强的知识蒸馏框架，使用MobileNetV3 Large作为教师模型，训练三种不同规模的残差CNN学生模型（1.3M、2.4M、3.8M参数）。

Result: 所有学生模型验证准确率超过96.7%，相比直接训练的95-96%有显著提升。紧凑模型达到97.11%准确率，比次优方法提高1.60个百分点，推理延迟仅72.19ms，知识保留率超过99%。

Conclusion: ATMS-KD框架在农业计算机视觉任务中表现出色，能够有效实现知识迁移，为资源受限的农业环境提供了高效的轻量级模型解决方案。

Abstract: This study proposes ATMS-KD (Adaptive Temperature and Mixed-Sample Knowledge
Distillation), a novel framework for developing lightweight CNN models suitable
for resource-constrained agricultural environments. The framework combines
adaptive temperature scheduling with mixed-sample augmentation to transfer
knowledge from a MobileNetV3 Large teacher model (5.7\,M parameters) to
lightweight residual CNN students. Three student configurations were evaluated:
Compact (1.3\,M parameters), Standard (2.4\,M parameters), and Enhanced (3.8\,M
parameters). The dataset used in this study consists of images of \textit{Rosa
damascena} (Damask rose) collected from agricultural fields in the Dades Oasis,
southeastern Morocco, providing a realistic benchmark for agricultural computer
vision applications under diverse environmental conditions. Experimental
evaluation on the Damascena rose maturity classification dataset demonstrated
significant improvements over direct training methods. All student models
achieved validation accuracies exceeding 96.7\% with ATMS-KD compared to
95--96\% with direct training. The framework outperformed eleven established
knowledge distillation methods, achieving 97.11\% accuracy with the compact
model -- a 1.60 percentage point improvement over the second-best approach
while maintaining the lowest inference latency of 72.19\,ms. Knowledge
retention rates exceeded 99\% for all configurations, demonstrating effective
knowledge transfer regardless of student model capacity.

### [10] [Linking heterogeneous microstructure informatics with expert characterization knowledge through customized and hybrid vision-language representations for industrial qualification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20243)
*Mutahar Safdar,Gentry Wood,Max Zimmermann,Guy Lamouche,Priti Wanjara,Yaoyao Fiona Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合视觉-语言表示(VLRs)的新框架，通过深度语义分割和多模态模型(CLIP和FLAVA)将微观结构数据与专家评估编码为共享表示，实现零样本分类和材料质量评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决先进材料在工业制造中快速可靠质量评估的瓶颈问题，特别是针对非传统增材制造工艺生产的异质结构材料。

Method: 开发定制化混合视觉-语言表示框架，集成深度语义分割与预训练多模态模型(CLIP和FLAVA)，使用基于相似性的表示方法结合正负参考样本，通过Z-score归一化实现跨模态对齐。

Result: 在增材制造金属基复合材料数据集上验证，框架能有效区分合格与缺陷样品，FLAVA模型具有更高视觉敏感性，CLIP模型与文本标准一致性更好。

Conclusion: 该方法通过促进原始数据与专家知识的语义互操作性，为工程信息学提供了可扩展和领域自适应的质量评估策略，增强了质量评估流程的可追溯性和可解释性。

Abstract: Rapid and reliable qualification of advanced materials remains a bottleneck
in industrial manufacturing, particularly for heterogeneous structures produced
via non-conventional additive manufacturing processes. This study introduces a
novel framework that links microstructure informatics with a range of expert
characterization knowledge using customized and hybrid vision-language
representations (VLRs). By integrating deep semantic segmentation with
pre-trained multi-modal models (CLIP and FLAVA), we encode both visual
microstructural data and textual expert assessments into shared
representations. To overcome limitations in general-purpose embeddings, we
develop a customized similarity-based representation that incorporates both
positive and negative references from expert-annotated images and their
associated textual descriptions. This allows zero-shot classification of
previously unseen microstructures through a net similarity scoring approach.
Validation on an additively manufactured metal matrix composite dataset
demonstrates the framework's ability to distinguish between acceptable and
defective samples across a range of characterization criteria. Comparative
analysis reveals that FLAVA model offers higher visual sensitivity, while the
CLIP model provides consistent alignment with the textual criteria. Z-score
normalization adjusts raw unimodal and cross-modal similarity scores based on
their local dataset-driven distributions, enabling more effective alignment and
classification in the hybrid vision-language framework. The proposed method
enhances traceability and interpretability in qualification pipelines by
enabling human-in-the-loop decision-making without task-specific model
retraining. By advancing semantic interoperability between raw data and expert
knowledge, this work contributes toward scalable and domain-adaptable
qualification strategies in engineering informatics.

TL;DR: 使用MedNeXt-L-k5模型进行自动化软脚空间分割，在T2加权MRI上达到预期性能，但在T1加权MRI上性能较低，且未超过nnU-Net。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动分割软脚空间耗时且可靠性中等，现有自动化深度学习模型性能中等且稿性一般化能力不足。

Method: 适配MedNeXt-L-k5转换器类3D编码器-解码器卷积网络，训练两个模型：一个使用均质T2加权MRI数据集，另一个使用异质T1加权MRI数据集。评估方法包括5折交叉验证和留一地点交叉验证。

Result: 在T2加权图像上达到胞元级Dice分数0.88±0.06（白质），类似于人工评分可靠性，为文献最高分。在T1加权图像上仅获0.58±0.09（白质）。在异质数据集上，胞元级Dice分数为0.38±0.16（白质）和0.35±0.12（基底节）。

Conclusion: MedNeXt-L-k5提供了一种高效的软脚空间自动分割方案，但转换器模型的关注机制并非PVS分割高准确性的必需条件，因为它未能超过nnU-Net的性能。

Abstract: Enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS) are increasingly recognized as biomarkers
of cerebral small vessel disease, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and
aging-related neurodegeneration. However, manual segmentation of PVS is
time-consuming and subject to moderate inter-rater reliability, while existing
automated deep learning models have moderate performance and typically fail to
generalize across diverse clinical and research MRI datasets. We adapted
MedNeXt-L-k5, a Transformer-inspired 3D encoder-decoder convolutional network,
for automated PVS segmentation. Two models were trained: one using a
homogeneous dataset of 200 T2-weighted (T2w) MRI scans from the Human
Connectome Project-Aging (HCP-Aging) dataset and another using 40 heterogeneous
T1-weighted (T1w) MRI volumes from seven studies across six scanners. Model
performance was evaluated using internal 5-fold cross validation (5FCV) and
leave-one-site-out cross validation (LOSOCV). MedNeXt-L-k5 models trained on
the T2w images of the HCP-Aging dataset achieved voxel-level Dice scores of
0.88+/-0.06 (white matter, WM), comparable to the reported inter-rater
reliability of that dataset, and the highest yet reported in the literature.
The same models trained on the T1w images of the HCP-Aging dataset achieved a
substantially lower Dice score of 0.58+/-0.09 (WM). Under LOSOCV, the model had
voxel-level Dice scores of 0.38+/-0.16 (WM) and 0.35+/-0.12 (BG), and
cluster-level Dice scores of 0.61+/-0.19 (WM) and 0.62+/-0.21 (BG).
MedNeXt-L-k5 provides an efficient solution for automated PVS segmentation
across diverse T1w and T2w MRI datasets. MedNeXt-L-k5 did not outperform the
nnU-Net, indicating that the attention-based mechanisms present in
transformer-inspired models to provide global context are not required for high
accuracy in PVS segmentation.

*Zhixiang Chi,Yanan Wu,Li Gu,Huan Liu,Ziqiang Wang,Yang Zhang,Yang Wang,Konstantinos N. Plataniotis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种无需训练的自适应反馈框架，通过将输出级的补丁级对应关系反馈到中间注意力层，增强CLIP在开放词汇分割中的空间一致性和语义一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP在视觉-文本对齐方面表现强劲，但在开放词汇分割中由于定位能力差而表现不佳。先前方法通过修改中间注意力来增强空间一致性，但由于后续操作（如投影）导致这种一致性无法持续传播到最终输出，且中间注意力缺乏与文本表示的直接交互。

Method: 训练免费、反馈驱动的自适应框架，将基于输出的补丁级对应关系反馈到中间注意力。设计关键模块包括注意力隔离、基于置信度的稀疏适应剪枝和适应集成，有效反馈输出一致性线索。作为插件模块无缝集成到四种最先进方法中。

Result: 方法在八个基准测试中一致提升了性能，支持三种骨干网络（ViT-B、ViT-L、ViT-H）和多种注意力类型（Q-K、self-self、以及使用MAE、SAM、DINO增强的Proxy）。

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过利用模型输出作为更强的空间一致性先验，有效增强了内部表示与最终预测之间的语义一致性，显著提升了开放词汇分割性能。

Abstract: CLIP exhibits strong visual-textual alignment but struggle with
open-vocabulary segmentation due to poor localization. Prior methods enhance
spatial coherence by modifying intermediate attention. But, this coherence
isn't consistently propagated to the final output due to subsequent operations
such as projections. Additionally, intermediate attention lacks direct
interaction with text representations, such semantic discrepancy limits the
full potential of CLIP.
  In this work, we propose a training-free, feedback-driven self-adaptive
framework that adapts output-based patch-level correspondences back to the
intermediate attention. The output predictions, being the culmination of the
model's processing, encapsulate the most comprehensive visual and textual
semantics about each patch. Our approach enhances semantic consistency between
internal representations and final predictions by leveraging the model's
outputs as a stronger spatial coherence prior. We design key modules, including
attention isolation, confidence-based pruning for sparse adaptation, and
adaptation ensemble, to effectively feedback the output coherence cues. Our
method functions as a plug-in module, seamlessly integrating into four
state-of-the-art approaches with three backbones (ViT-B, ViT-L, ViT-H). We
further validate our framework across multiple attention types (Q-K, self-self,

*Jeong Hun Yeo,Hyeongseop Rha,Sungjune Park,Junil Won,Yong Man Ro*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 首个统一框架，能够处理手语、唇部动作和音频等多模态组合，用于生成口语文本，在多个任务上达到或超过专门模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语音识别系统对聋人群体无法访问，而手语和唇读等视觉模态通常被独立研究，需要一个统一框架来整合这些模态。

Method: 设计了一个统一的、模态无关的架构，能够有效处理异构输入，并明确将唇部动作模型化为独立模态。

Result: 在SLT、VSR、ASR和AVSR等多个任务上达到或超过了专门模型的性能，并发现明确建模唇部动作显著提升了手语翻译的性能。

Conclusion: 该统一框架成功整合了多模态输入，为聋人群体提供了更好的访问性，并且证明了唇部动作在手语理解中的重要作用。

Abstract: Audio is the primary modality for human communication and has driven the
success of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technologies. However, such
systems remain inherently inaccessible to individuals who are deaf or hard of
hearing. Visual alternatives such as sign language and lip reading offer
effective substitutes, and recent advances in Sign Language Translation (SLT)
and Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) have improved audio-less communication.
Yet, these modalities have largely been studied in isolation, and their
integration within a unified framework remains underexplored. In this paper, we
introduce the first unified framework capable of handling diverse combinations
of sign language, lip movements, and audio for spoken-language text generation.
We focus on three main objectives: (i) designing a unified, modality-agnostic
architecture capable of effectively processing heterogeneous inputs; (ii)
exploring the underexamined synergy among modalities, particularly the role of
lip movements as non-manual cues in sign language comprehension; and (iii)
achieving performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art models
specialized for individual tasks. Building on this framework, we achieve
performance on par with or better than task-specific state-of-the-art models
across SLT, VSR, ASR, and AVSR. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that
explicitly modeling lip movements as a separate modality significantly improves
SLT performance.

*Zhuoran Yu,Yong Jae Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个探测框架来系统分析多模态大语言模型在不同层次处理视觉和文本输入的方式，发现模型具有一致的阶段性结构：早期层负责视觉基础，中间层支持词汇整合和语义推理，最终层准备任务特定输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉语言任务中表现出色，但其内部处理机制仍未被充分探索，需要系统性地分析模型如何处理多模态输入。

Method: 训练线性分类器从每个层次的token嵌入中预测细粒度视觉类别，使用标准锚点问题，并在三种提示变体下评估：词汇变体、语义否定变体和输出格式变体。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5、LLaVA-Next-LLaMA-3和Qwen2-VL模型中发现一致的阶段性结构，整体结构在不同视觉分词、指令调优数据和预训练语料下保持稳定，但具体层次分配随基础LLM架构变化而显著变化。

Conclusion: 研究提供了对MLLM层次组织结构的统一视角，并提供了一个轻量级、模型无关的方法来分析多模态表示动态。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong performance
across a wide range of vision-language tasks, yet their internal processing
dynamics remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce a probing framework
to systematically analyze how MLLMs process visual and textual inputs across
layers. We train linear classifiers to predict fine-grained visual categories
(e.g., dog breeds) from token embeddings extracted at each layer, using a
standardized anchor question. To uncover the functional roles of different
layers, we evaluate these probes under three types of controlled prompt
variations: (1) lexical variants that test sensitivity to surface-level
changes, (2) semantic negation variants that flip the expected answer by
modifying the visual concept in the prompt, and (3) output format variants that
preserve reasoning but alter the answer format. Applying our framework to
LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-Next-LLaMA-3, and Qwen2-VL, we identify a consistent
stage-wise structure in which early layers perform visual grounding, middle
layers support lexical integration and semantic reasoning, and final layers
prepare task-specific outputs. We further show that while the overall
stage-wise structure remains stable across variations in visual tokenization,
instruction tuning data, and pretraining corpus, the specific layer allocation
to each stage shifts notably with changes in the base LLM architecture. Our
findings provide a unified perspective on the layer-wise organization of MLLMs
and offer a lightweight, model-agnostic approach for analyzing multimodal
representation dynamics.

TL;DR: Dino U-Net是一个基于DINOv3视觉基础模型的编码器-解码器架构，通过专用适配器和保真度感知投影模块，有效利用预训练特征进行医学图像分割，在多个数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然在大规模自然图像数据集上预训练的基础模型为医学图像分割提供了强大范式，但如何有效迁移其学习表示以用于精确临床应用仍然是一个挑战。

Method: 提出Dino U-Net架构，使用冻结的DINOv3主干作为编码器，通过专用适配器融合语义特征和空间细节，设计保真度感知投影模块(FAPM)在降维过程中保持表示质量。

Result: 在七个不同的公共医学图像分割数据集上进行广泛实验，结果显示Dino U-Net实现了最先进的性能，在各种成像模态上始终优于先前方法，且随着主干模型规模增大（最大70亿参数），分割精度持续提升。

Conclusion: 利用通用基础模型的优质密集预训练特征，为提升医学图像分割精度提供了高效且参数有效的方法，证明了该框架的高度可扩展性。

Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained on large-scale natural image datasets offer a
powerful paradigm for medical image segmentation. However, effectively
transferring their learned representations for precise clinical applications
remains a challenge. In this work, we propose Dino U-Net, a novel
encoder-decoder architecture designed to exploit the high-fidelity dense
features of the DINOv3 vision foundation model. Our architecture introduces an
encoder built upon a frozen DINOv3 backbone, which employs a specialized
adapter to fuse the model's rich semantic features with low-level spatial
details. To preserve the quality of these representations during dimensionality
reduction, we design a new fidelity-aware projection module (FAPM) that
effectively refines and projects the features for the decoder. We conducted
extensive experiments on seven diverse public medical image segmentation
datasets. Our results show that Dino U-Net achieves state-of-the-art
performance, consistently outperforming previous methods across various imaging
modalities. Our framework proves to be highly scalable, with segmentation
accuracy consistently improving as the backbone model size increases up to the
7-billion-parameter variant. The findings demonstrate that leveraging the
superior, dense-pretrained features from a general-purpose foundation model
provides a highly effective and parameter-efficient approach to advance the
accuracy of medical image segmentation. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出SLiCS方法，通过监督字典学习将视觉-语言联合嵌入空间分解为概念特定的线性子空间，实现更精确的概念过滤图像检索和条件生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言联合嵌入空间（如CLIP）包含丰富的语义信息，但缺乏对复杂场景内容信息的解耦能力。作者假设可以通过将嵌入分解为多个概念特定的组件向量来实现空间解耦。

Method: 采用监督字典学习方法，估计一个线性合成模型，通过稀疏、非负的字典原子组合来匹配多标签信息。使用新颖的交替优化算法保证收敛，并利用文本嵌入进行语义描述和零样本分类。

Result: SLiCS方法在TiTok压缩自编码器嵌入和DINOv2自监督嵌入上均表现出色，定量和定性结果都显示概念过滤图像检索的精度显著提升。

Conclusion: 稀疏线性概念子空间（SLiCS）能够有效解耦嵌入空间，为概念过滤的图像检索和条件生成提供更精确的结果，适用于多种嵌入表示。

Abstract: Vision-language co-embedding networks, such as CLIP, provide a latent
embedding space with semantic information that is useful for downstream tasks.
We hypothesize that the embedding space can be disentangled to separate the
information on the content of complex scenes by decomposing the embedding into
multiple concept-specific component vectors that lie in different subspaces. We
propose a supervised dictionary learning approach to estimate a linear
synthesis model consisting of sparse, non-negative combinations of groups of
vectors in the dictionary (atoms), whose group-wise activity matches the
multi-label information. Each concept-specific component is a non-negative
combination of atoms associated to a label. The group-structured dictionary is
optimized through a novel alternating optimization with guaranteed convergence.
Exploiting the text co-embeddings, we detail how semantically meaningful
descriptions can be found based on text embeddings of words best approximated
by a concept's group of atoms, and unsupervised dictionary learning can exploit
zero-shot classification of training set images using the text embeddings of
concept labels to provide instance-wise multi-labels. We show that the
disentangled embeddings provided by our sparse linear concept subspaces (SLiCS)
enable concept-filtered image retrieval (and conditional generation using
image-to-prompt) that is more precise. We also apply SLiCS to highly-compressed
autoencoder embeddings from TiTok and the latent embedding from self-supervised
DINOv2. Quantitative and qualitative results highlight the improved precision
of the concept-filtered image retrieval for all embeddings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗视觉-语言模型在临床应用中带来重大机遇，但同时引发严重的安全风险，包括病人健康信息泄露、数据泄漏和网络安全脏劣。医疗机构在采用这些模型时必须仔细谨慎并实施保护措施。

Method: 提出MedFoundationHub图形用户界面工具包：1）让医生无需编程知识手动选择和使用不同模型；2）支持工程师通过插件式方式高效部署医疗VLMs，并无缝集成Hugging Face开源模型；3）通过Docker组织的操作系统无关部署确保隐私保护推理。该工具只需一台离线本地工作站配备单台NVIDIA A6000 GPU。

Abstract: Recent advances in medical vision-language models (VLMs) open up remarkable
opportunities for clinical applications such as automated report generation,
copilots for physicians, and uncertainty quantification. However, despite their
promise, medical VLMs introduce serious security concerns, most notably risks
of Protected Health Information (PHI) exposure, data leakage, and vulnerability
to cyberthreats - which are especially critical in hospital environments. Even
when adopted for research or non-clinical purposes, healthcare organizations
must exercise caution and implement safeguards. To address these challenges, we
present MedFoundationHub, a graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit that: (1)
enables physicians to manually select and use different models without
programming expertise, (2) supports engineers in efficiently deploying medical
VLMs in a plug-and-play fashion, with seamless integration of Hugging Face
open-source models, and (3) ensures privacy-preserving inference through
Docker-orchestrated, operating system agnostic deployment. MedFoundationHub
requires only an offline local workstation equipped with a single NVIDIA A6000
GPU, making it both secure and accessible within the typical resources of
academic research labs. To evaluate current capabilities, we engaged
board-certified pathologists to deploy and assess five state-of-the-art VLMs
(Google-MedGemma3-4B, Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, and
LLaVA-1.5-7B/13B). Expert evaluation covered colon cases and renal cases,
yielding 1015 clinician-model scoring events. These assessments revealed
recurring limitations, including off-target answers, vague reasoning, and
inconsistent pathology terminology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务密集预测需要充分的跨任务交互，但现有方法面临交互完整性和计算效率之间的权衡限制

Method: 引入双向交互扫描（BI-Scan）机制构建任务特定的双向序列表示，结合任务优先和位置优先扫描模式；采用多尺度扫描（MS-Scan）机制实现多粒度场景建模

Result: 在NYUD-V2和PASCAL-Context基准测试中表现出优于最先进竞争方法的性能

Conclusion: BIM模型通过创新的扫描机制有效解决了多任务密集预测中的计算复杂度和交互完整性平衡问题

Abstract: Sufficient cross-task interaction is crucial for success in multi-task dense
prediction. However, sufficient interaction often results in high computational
complexity, forcing existing methods to face the trade-off between interaction
completeness and computational efficiency. To address this limitation, this
work proposes a Bidirectional Interaction Mamba (BIM), which incorporates novel
scanning mechanisms to adapt the Mamba modeling approach for multi-task dense
prediction. On the one hand, we introduce a novel Bidirectional Interaction
Scan (BI-Scan) mechanism, which constructs task-specific representations as
bidirectional sequences during interaction. By integrating task-first and
position-first scanning modes within a unified linear complexity architecture,
BI-Scan efficiently preserves critical cross-task information. On the other
hand, we employ a Multi-Scale Scan~(MS-Scan) mechanism to achieve
multi-granularity scene modeling. This design not only meets the diverse
granularity requirements of various tasks but also enhances nuanced cross-task
feature interactions. Extensive experiments on two challenging benchmarks,
\emph{i.e.}, NYUD-V2 and PASCAL-Context, show the superiority of our BIM vs its
state-of-the-art competitors.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种无需训练的音频导航视觉编辑方案，通过多模态提示的结合，有效解决了复杂编辑任务的挑战。

Abstract: Visual editing with diffusion models has made significant progress but often
struggles with complex scenarios that textual guidance alone could not
adequately describe, highlighting the need for additional non-text editing
prompts. In this work, we introduce a novel audio-guided visual editing
framework that can handle complex editing tasks with multiple text and audio
prompts without requiring additional training. Existing audio-guided visual
editing methods often necessitate training on specific datasets to align audio
with text, limiting their generalization to real-world situations. We leverage
a pre-trained multi-modal encoder with strong zero-shot capabilities and
integrate diverse audio into visual editing tasks, by alleviating the
discrepancy between the audio encoder space and the diffusion model's prompt
encoder space. Additionally, we propose a novel approach to handle complex
scenarios with multiple and multi-modal editing prompts through our separate
noise branching and adaptive patch selection. Our comprehensive experiments on
diverse editing tasks demonstrate that our framework excels in handling
complicated editing scenarios by incorporating rich information from audio,
where text-only approaches fail.

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的大量实验表明，该框架显著推进了多标签分类，达到了最先进的性能

Conclusion: AEVLP框架通过创新的损失函数和伪标签技术，有效解决了SPML中的噪声和准确性问题，为多标签学习提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: Multi-label learning is a challenging computer vision task that requires
assigning multiple categories to each image. However, fully annotating
large-scale datasets is often impractical due to high costs and effort,
motivating the study of learning from partially annotated data. In the extreme
case of Single Positive Multi-Label Learning (SPML), each image is provided
with only one positive label, while all other labels remain unannotated.
Traditional SPML methods that treat missing labels as unknown or negative tend
to yield inaccuracies and false negatives, and integrating various
pseudo-labeling strategies can introduce additional noise. To address these
challenges, we propose the Generalized Pseudo-Label Robust Loss (GPR Loss), a
novel loss function that effectively learns from diverse pseudo-labels while
mitigating noise. Complementing this, we introduce a simple yet effective
Dynamic Augmented Multi-focus Pseudo-labeling (DAMP) technique. Together, these
contributions form the Adaptive and Efficient Vision-Language Pseudo-Labeling
(AEVLP) framework. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our framework significantly advances multi-label classification, achieving
state-of-the-art results.

Motivation: 当前ANN-SNN转换方法在分类任务中表现优异，但在视觉检测任务中性能仍然不理想，主要存在异质脉冲模式导致的残余膜电位问题。

Method: 1. 延迟脉冲方法缓解异质脉冲模式引起的残余膜电位问题；2. 提出时间依赖的IF神经元(tdIF)，使神经元能够根据时间步长的时序动态调整积累和发放行为。

Result: 在目标检测和车道线检测两个关键视觉任务上，该方法超越了当前ANN-SNN转换方法，在超低延迟(5个时间步长内)下实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: tdIF方法使脉冲具有不同的时间特性，而不仅仅依赖频率表示，能够在更低时间步长下实现更精确的特征表示，同时保持与传统IF神经元相当的能量消耗。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by the brain, are characterized by
minimal power consumption and swift inference capabilities on neuromorphic
hardware, and have been widely applied to various visual perception tasks.
Current ANN-SNN conversion methods have achieved excellent results in
classification tasks with ultra-low time-steps, but their performance in visual
detection tasks remains suboptimal. In this paper, we propose a delay-spike
approach to mitigate the issue of residual membrane potential caused by
heterogeneous spiking patterns. Furthermore, we propose a novel
temporal-dependent Integrate-and-Fire (tdIF) neuron architecture for SNNs. This
enables Integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons to dynamically adjust their
accumulation and firing behaviors based on the temporal order of time-steps.
Our method enables spikes to exhibit distinct temporal properties, rather than
relying solely on frequency-based representations. Moreover, the tdIF neuron
maintains energy consumption on par with traditional IF neuron. We demonstrate
that our method achieves more precise feature representation with lower
time-steps, enabling high performance and ultra-low latency in visual detection
tasks. In this study, we conduct extensive evaluation of the tdIF method across
two critical vision tasks: object detection and lane line detection. The
results demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses current ANN-SNN
conversion approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance with ultra-low
latency (within 5 time-steps).

Motivation: 现有显著目标检测方法在复杂场景中容易丢失细节、模糊边缘，且单模态信息融合不充分，需要提升对小结构和边缘区域的检测精度。

Method: 设计动态不确定性图卷积模块(DUGC)通过空间语义距离构建稀疏图传播不确定性；提出多模态协同融合策略(MCF)使用可学习模态门控权重融合RGB、深度和边缘特征；采用多尺度BCE和IoU损失、跨尺度一致性约束和不确定性引导监督机制优化检测性能。

Conclusion: DUP-MCRNet通过动态不确定性传播和多模态协同融合有效提升了显著目标检测的性能，特别是在细节保持和边缘清晰度方面有显著改进。

Abstract: In view of the problems that existing salient object detection (SOD) methods
are prone to losing details, blurring edges, and insufficient fusion of
single-modal information in complex scenes, this paper proposes a dynamic
uncertainty propagation and multimodal collaborative reasoning network
(DUP-MCRNet). Firstly, a dynamic uncertainty graph convolution module (DUGC) is
designed to propagate uncertainty between layers through a sparse graph
constructed based on spatial semantic distance, and combined with channel
adaptive interaction, it effectively improves the detection accuracy of small
structures and edge regions. Secondly, a multimodal collaborative fusion
strategy (MCF) is proposed, which uses learnable modality gating weights to
weightedly fuse the attention maps of RGB, depth, and edge features. It can
dynamically adjust the importance of each modality according to different
scenes, effectively suppress redundant or interfering information, and
strengthen the semantic complementarity and consistency between
cross-modalities, thereby improving the ability to identify salient regions
under occlusion, weak texture or background interference. Finally, the
detection performance at the pixel level and region level is optimized through
multi-scale BCE and IoU loss, cross-scale consistency constraints, and
uncertainty-guided supervision mechanisms. Extensive experiments show that
DUP-MCRNet outperforms various SOD methods on most common benchmark datasets,
especially in terms of edge clarity and robustness to complex backgrounds. Our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/YukiBear426/DUP-MCRNet.

Conclusion: 通过多尺度BEV特征利用多尺度图像特征能显著提升多视角行人检测性能，特别是在处理尺度变化大的行人检测场景中

Abstract: Multi-View Pedestrian Detection (MVPD) aims to detect pedestrians in the form
of a bird's eye view (BEV) from multi-view images. In MVPD, end-to-end
trainable deep learning methods have progressed greatly. However, they often
struggle to detect pedestrians with consistently small or large scales in views
or with vastly different scales between views. This is because they do not
exploit multi-scale image features to generate the BEV feature and detect
pedestrians. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel MVPD method, called
Multi-Scale Multi-View Detection (MSMVD). MSMVD generates multi-scale BEV
features by projecting multi-scale image features extracted from individual
views into the BEV space, scale-by-scale. Each of these BEV features inherits
the properties of its corresponding scale image features from multiple views.
Therefore, these BEV features help the precise detection of pedestrians with
consistently small or large scales in views. Then, MSMVD combines information
at different scales of multiple views by processing the multi-scale BEV
features using a feature pyramid network. This improves the detection of
pedestrians with vastly different scales between views. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that exploiting multi-scale image features via multi-scale BEV
features greatly improves the detection performance, and MSMVD outperforms the
previous highest MODA by $4.5$ points on the GMVD dataset.

Conclusion: SFMFNet为实时深度伪造检测提供了一种有效的轻量级解决方案，适合视频会议和社交媒体等实际应用场景

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of real-time deepfake generation techniques,
forged content is becoming increasingly realistic and widespread across
applications like video conferencing and social media. Although
state-of-the-art detectors achieve high accuracy on standard benchmarks, their
heavy computational cost hinders real-time deployment in practical
applications. To address this, we propose the Spatial-Frequency Aware
Multi-Scale Fusion Network (SFMFNet), a lightweight yet effective architecture
for real-time deepfake detection. We design a spatial-frequency hybrid aware
module that jointly leverages spatial textures and frequency artifacts through
a gated mechanism, enhancing sensitivity to subtle manipulations. A
token-selective cross attention mechanism enables efficient multi-level feature
interaction, while a residual-enhanced blur pooling structure helps retain key
semantic cues during downsampling. Experiments on several benchmark datasets
show that SFMFNet achieves a favorable balance between accuracy and efficiency,
with strong generalization and practical value for real-time applications.

practical implementation. Thus, developing lightweight models that achieve
comparable performance to large-scale models while maintaining computational
efficiency is crucial. To address this, we employ a dual-model weight selection
strategy that initializes two lightweight models with weights derived from a
large pretrained model, enabling effective knowledge transfer. Next, SKD is
applied to these selected models, allowing the use of a broad range of initial
weight configurations without imposing additional excessive computational cost,
followed by fine-tuning for the target classification tasks. By combining
dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation, our method
overcomes the limitations of conventional approaches, which often fail to
retain critical information in compact models. Extensive experiments on
publicly available datasets-chest X-ray images, lung computed tomography scans,
and brain magnetic resonance imaging scans-demonstrate the superior performance
and robustness of our approach compared to existing methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于几何重密度化和跨尺度特征传播的LiDAR点云压缩方法，在保持轻量级的同时实现高效压缩和实时性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将无序点云转换为层次化结构进行预测编码，但几何细节的极端稀疏性阻碍了高效的上下文建模，限制了压缩性能和速度

Method: 包含两个轻量级模块：1) 几何重密度化模块 - 重新密度化稀疏几何，在更密集尺度提取特征后重新稀疏化；2) 跨尺度特征传播模块 - 利用多分辨率占用线索指导层次特征传播

Result: 在KITTI数据集上实现最先进的压缩比和实时性能，12位量化下编码和解码均达到26 FPS

Conclusion: 通过集成两个模块生成紧凑特征表示，提供高效上下文建模并加速编码过程，解决了稀疏几何细节的高效压缩问题

Abstract: LiDAR point clouds are fundamental to various applications, yet
high-precision scans incur substantial storage and transmission overhead.
Existing methods typically convert unordered points into hierarchical octree or
voxel structures for dense-to-sparse predictive coding. However, the extreme
sparsity of geometric details hinders efficient context modeling, thereby
limiting their compression performance and speed. To address this challenge, we
propose to generate compact features for efficient predictive coding. Our
framework comprises two lightweight modules. First, the Geometry
Re-Densification Module re-densifies encoded sparse geometry, extracts features
at denser scale, and then re-sparsifies the features for predictive coding.
This module avoids costly computation on highly sparse details while
maintaining a lightweight prediction head. Second, the Cross-scale Feature
Propagation Module leverages occupancy cues from multiple resolution levels to
guide hierarchical feature propagation. This design facilitates information
sharing across scales, thereby reducing redundant feature extraction and
providing enriched features for the Geometry Re-Densification Module. By
integrating these two modules, our method yields a compact feature
representation that provides efficient context modeling and accelerates the
coding process. Experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art
compression ratios and real-time performance, achieving 26 FPS for both
encoding and decoding at 12-bit quantization. Code is available at

Abstract: Scaling laws have validated the success and promise of large-data-trained
models in creative generation across text, image, and video domains. However,
this paradigm faces data scarcity in the 3D domain, as there is far less of it
available on the internet compared to the aforementioned modalities.
Fortunately, there exist adequate videos that inherently contain commonsense
priors, offering an alternative supervisory signal to mitigate the
generalization bottleneck caused by limited native 3D data. On the one hand,
videos capturing multiple views of an object or scene provide a spatial
consistency prior for 3D generation. On the other hand, the rich semantic
information contained within the videos enables the generated content to be
more faithful to the text prompts and semantically plausible. This paper
explores how to apply the video modality in 3D asset generation, spanning
datasets to models. We introduce Droplet3D-4M, the first large-scale video
dataset with multi-view level annotations, and train Droplet3D, a generative
model supporting both image and dense text input. Extensive experiments
validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its ability to
produce spatially consistent and semantically plausible content. Moreover, in
contrast to the prevailing 3D solutions, our approach exhibits the potential
for extension to scene-level applications. This indicates that the commonsense
priors from the videos significantly facilitate 3D creation. We have
open-sourced all resources including the dataset, code, technical framework,
and model weights: https://dropletx.github.io/.

Motivation: 自动驾驶系统中收集真实世界的极端案例成本高且危险，现有编辑方法存在视觉保真度有限和姿态控制不精确的问题。

Abstract: Corner cases are crucial for training and validating autonomous driving
systems, yet collecting them from the real world is often costly and hazardous.
Editing objects within captured sensor data offers an effective alternative for
generating diverse scenarios, commonly achieved through 3D Gaussian Splatting
or image generative models. However, these approaches often suffer from limited
visual fidelity or imprecise pose control. To address these issues, we propose
G^2Editor, a framework designed for photorealistic and precise object editing
in driving videos. Our method leverages a 3D Gaussian representation of the
edited object as a dense prior, injected into the denoising process to ensure
accurate pose control and spatial consistency. A scene-level 3D bounding box
layout is employed to reconstruct occluded areas of non-target objects.
Furthermore, to guide the appearance details of the edited object, we
incorporate hierarchical fine-grained features as additional conditions during
generation. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that G^2Editor
effectively supports object repositioning, insertion, and deletion within a
unified framework, outperforming existing methods in both pose controllability
and visual quality, while also benefiting downstream data-driven tasks.

Motivation: 胎儿脑部精确分割对于评估神经发育至关重要，但胰体育肢发育不良(CCD)等程度引起的解剖结构变化以及缺缓注释数据限制了深度学习模型的普适性

Method: 提出病理知识领域随机化策略，将CCD表现的先验知识嵌入合成数据生成流程，仅使用健康数据模拟多样的脑部变异

Result: 在248例健康胎儿、26例CCD和47例其他脑部病理的群体中验证，在CCD案例中取得显著改善，同时保持对健康和其他病理的性能。LCC估计错误从10.9mm降至0.7mm

Conclusion: 将领域特定解剖先验知识集成到合成数据流程中，可有效缓解数据缺乏问题并提升少见但临床重要病变的分析能力

Abstract: Accurate fetal brain segmentation is crucial for extracting biomarkers and
assessing neurodevelopment, especially in conditions such as corpus callosum
dysgenesis (CCD), which can induce drastic anatomical changes. However, the
rarity of CCD severely limits annotated data, hindering the generalization of
deep learning models. To address this, we propose a pathology-informed domain
randomization strategy that embeds prior knowledge of CCD manifestations into a
synthetic data generation pipeline. By simulating diverse brain alterations
from healthy data alone, our approach enables robust segmentation without
requiring pathological annotations.
  We validate our method on a cohort comprising 248 healthy fetuses, 26 with
CCD, and 47 with other brain pathologies, achieving substantial improvements on
CCD cases while maintaining performance on both healthy fetuses and those with
other pathologies. From the predicted segmentations, we derive clinically
relevant biomarkers, such as corpus callosum length (LCC) and volume, and show
their utility in distinguishing CCD subtypes. Our pathology-informed
augmentation reduces the LCC estimation error from 1.89 mm to 0.80 mm in
healthy cases and from 10.9 mm to 0.7 mm in CCD cases. Beyond these
quantitative gains, our approach yields segmentations with improved topological
consistency relative to available ground truth, enabling more reliable
shape-based analyses. Overall, this work demonstrates that incorporating
domain-specific anatomical priors into synthetic data pipelines can effectively
mitigate data scarcity and enhance analysis of rare but clinically significant
malformations.

Result: 在VideoMME、MLVU和EgoSchema等基准测试中，Video-MTR在准确性和效率方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Video-MTR通过端到端的强化多轮推理框架，有效解决了长视频理解的挑战，推动了该领域的技术发展。

Abstract: Long-form video understanding, characterized by long-range temporal
dependencies and multiple events, remains a challenge. Existing methods often
rely on static reasoning or external visual-language models (VLMs), which face
issues like complexity and sub-optimal performance due to the lack of
end-to-end training. In this paper, we propose Video-MTR, a reinforced
multi-turn reasoning framework designed to enable iterative key video segment
selection and question comprehension. Unlike traditional video reasoning
pipeline, which generate predictions in a single turn, Video-MTR performs
reasoning in multiple turns, selecting video segments progressively based on
the evolving understanding of previously processed segments and the current
question. This iterative process allows for a more refined and contextually
aware analysis of the video. To ensure intermediate reasoning process, we
introduce a novel gated bi-level reward system, combining trajectory-level
rewards based on answer correctness and turn-level rewards emphasizing
frame-query relevance. This system optimizes both video segment selection and
question comprehension, eliminating the need for external VLMs and allowing
end-to-end training. Extensive experiments on benchmarks like VideoMME, MLVU,
and EgoSchema demonstrate that Video-MTR outperforms existing methods in both
accuracy and efficiency, advancing the state-of-the-art in long video
understanding.

Method: 提出双重不确定性优化（DUO）框架：1）通过凸优化视角创新性地推导出无监督版本的focal loss，实现标签无关的不确定性加权；2）设计语义感知的法向量场约束，在语义清晰区域保持几何一致性；3）建立语义-几何互补的双分支机制。

Result: 在多个数据集和不同类型的域偏移场景下，DUO方法相比现有方法表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: DUO框架通过联合优化语义和几何不确定性，有效提升了单目3D目标检测在域偏移条件下的鲁棒性和可靠性，为安全关键应用提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate monocular 3D object detection (M3OD) is pivotal for safety-critical
applications like autonomous driving, yet its reliability deteriorates
significantly under real-world domain shifts caused by environmental or sensor
variations. To address these shifts, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods have
emerged, enabling models to adapt to target distributions during inference.
While prior TTA approaches recognize the positive correlation between low
uncertainty and high generalization ability, they fail to address the dual
uncertainty inherent to M3OD: semantic uncertainty (ambiguous class
predictions) and geometric uncertainty (unstable spatial localization). To
bridge this gap, we propose Dual Uncertainty Optimization (DUO), the first TTA
framework designed to jointly minimize both uncertainties for robust M3OD.
Through a convex optimization lens, we introduce an innovative convex structure
of the focal loss and further derive a novel unsupervised version, enabling
label-agnostic uncertainty weighting and balanced learning for high-uncertainty
objects. In parallel, we design a semantic-aware normal field constraint that
preserves geometric coherence in regions with clear semantic cues, reducing
uncertainty from the unstable 3D representation. This dual-branch mechanism
forms a complementary loop: enhanced spatial perception improves semantic
classification, and robust semantic predictions further refine spatial
understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DUO over
existing methods across various datasets and domain shift types.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to more studies to enhance golfers'
shot precision. However, these existing studies have not quantitatively
established the relationship between swing posture and ball trajectory,
limiting their ability to provide golfers with the necessary insights for swing
improvement. In this paper, we propose a new dataset called CaddieSet, which
includes joint information and various ball information from a single shot.
CaddieSet extracts joint information from a single swing video by segmenting it
into eight swing phases using a computer vision-based approach. Furthermore,
based on expert golf domain knowledge, we define 15 key metrics that influence
a golf swing, enabling the interpretation of swing outcomes through
swing-related features. Through experiments, we demonstrated the feasibility of
CaddieSet for predicting ball trajectories using various benchmarks. In
particular, we focus on interpretable models among several benchmarks and
verify that swing feedback using our joint features is quantitatively
consistent with established domain knowledge. This work is expected to offer
new insight into golf swing analysis for both academia and the sports industry.

Result: 在MVTec 3D-AD数据集上实现了新的最先进性能，显著降低了误报率。

Conclusion: IAENet通过有效融合2D和3D专家模型，显著提升了3D表面异常检测性能，具有工业部署的实用价值。

Abstract: Surface anomaly detection is pivotal for ensuring product quality in
industrial manufacturing. While 2D image-based methods have achieved remarkable
success, 3D point cloud-based detection remains underexplored despite its
richer geometric cues. We argue that the key bottleneck is the absence of
powerful pretrained foundation backbones in 3D comparable to those in 2D. To
bridge this gap, we propose Importance-Aware Ensemble Network (IAENet), an
ensemble framework that synergizes 2D pretrained expert with 3D expert models.
However, naively fusing predictions from disparate sources is non-trivial:
existing strategies can be affected by a poorly performing modality and thus
degrade overall accuracy. To address this challenge, We introduce an novel
Importance-Aware Fusion (IAF) module that dynamically assesses the contribution
of each source and reweights their anomaly scores. Furthermore, we devise
critical loss functions that explicitly guide the optimization of IAF, enabling
it to combine the collective knowledge of the source experts but also preserve
their unique strengths, thereby enhancing the overall performance of anomaly
detection. Extensive experiments on MVTec 3D-AD demonstrate that our IAENet
achieves a new state-of-the-art with a markedly lower false positive rate,
underscoring its practical value for industrial deployment.

Conclusion: 该方法克服了指令数据集质量限制，具有更好的可扩展性和兼容性，为语义图像编辑提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the progress in text-to-image generation, semantic image editing
remains a challenge. Inversion-based algorithms unavoidably introduce
reconstruction errors, while instruction-based models mainly suffer from
limited dataset quality and scale. To address these problems, we propose a
descriptive-prompt-based editing framework, named DescriptiveEdit. The core
idea is to re-frame `instruction-based image editing' as `reference-image-based
text-to-image generation', which preserves the generative power of well-trained
Text-to-Image models without architectural modifications or inversion.
Specifically, taking the reference image and a prompt as input, we introduce a
Cross-Attentive UNet, which newly adds attention bridges to inject reference
image features into the prompt-to-edit-image generation process. Owing to its
text-to-image nature, DescriptiveEdit overcomes limitations in instruction
dataset quality, integrates seamlessly with ControlNet, IP-Adapter, and other
extensions, and is more scalable. Experiments on the Emu Edit benchmark show it
improves editing accuracy and consistency.

Motivation: 在无法访问源域数据的情况下，现有方法依赖模型预测生成伪标签，但伪标签质量无法保证且存在误差累积问题，需要新的解决方案。

Method: 使用双分类器将目标数据的特征表示解耦为语义相关特征和域相关特征，通过保持子特征与整体特征的一致性来多角度捕捉数据特征，并设置自适应阈值进行置信度加权的自监督学习。

Conclusion: DCFS框架通过特征解耦和一致性约束，结合置信度感知学习，有效解决了持续测试时适应中的伪标签噪声和误差累积问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Continual test-time adaptation aims to continuously adapt a pre-trained model
to a stream of target domain data without accessing source data. Without access
to source domain data, the model focuses solely on the feature characteristics
of the target data. Relying exclusively on these features can lead to confusion
and introduce learning biases. Currently, many existing methods generate
pseudo-labels via model predictions. However, the quality of pseudo-labels
cannot be guaranteed and the problem of error accumulation must be solved. To
address these challenges, we propose DCFS, a novel CTTA framework that
introduces dual-path feature consistency and confidence-aware sample learning.
This framework disentangles the whole feature representation of the target data
into semantic-related feature and domain-related feature using dual classifiers
to learn distinct feature representations. By maintaining consistency between
the sub-features and the whole feature, the model can comprehensively capture
data features from multiple perspectives. Additionally, to ensure that the
whole feature information of the target domain samples is not overlooked, we
set a adaptive threshold and calculate a confidence score for each sample to
carry out loss weighted self-supervised learning, effectively reducing the
noise of pseudo-labels and alleviating the problem of error accumulation. The
efficacy of our proposed method is validated through extensive experimentation
across various datasets, including CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, and ImageNet-C,
demonstrating consistent performance in continual test-time adaptation
scenarios.

Motivation: 相机标定质量对新视角合成至关重要，1像素错误就会对重建质量产生显著影响，而现有方法缺乏真实场景的真实标定标准

Method: 使用3DGS模型，通过背向传播新视角颜色损失来优化相机参数，实现相机标定的细调

Result: 在3DGS参考数据集上，新的标定方法平均提升了0.4 dB PSNR

Conclusion: 虽然细调过程可能耗时较长，但对于重要场景的标定（如Mip-NeRF 360），新视角质量的提升价值远超过训练时间成本

Abstract: The quality of the camera calibration is of major importance for evaluating
progresses in novel view synthesis, as a 1-pixel error on the calibration has a
significant impact on the reconstruction quality. While there is no ground
truth for real scenes, the quality of the calibration is assessed by the
quality of the novel view synthesis. This paper proposes to use a 3DGS model to
fine tune calibration by backpropagation of novel view color loss with respect
to the cameras parameters. The new calibration alone brings an average
improvement of 0.4 dB PSNR on the dataset used as reference by 3DGS. The fine
tuning may be long and its suitability depends on the criticity of training
time, but for calibration of reference scenes, such as Mip-NeRF 360, the stake
of novel view quality is the most important.

Abstract: Accurate gross tumor volume segmentation on multi-modal medical data is
critical for radiotherapy planning in nasopharyngeal carcinoma and
glioblastoma. Recent advances in deep neural networks have brought promising
results in medical image segmentation, leading to an increasing demand for
labeled data. Since labeling medical images is time-consuming and
labor-intensive, active learning has emerged as a solution to reduce annotation
costs by selecting the most informative samples to label and adapting
high-performance models with as few labeled samples as possible. Previous
active domain adaptation (ADA) methods seek to minimize sample redundancy by
selecting samples that are farthest from the source domain. However, such
one-off selection can easily cause negative transfer, and access to source
medical data is often limited. Moreover, the query strategy for multi-modal
medical data remains unexplored. In this work, we propose an active and
sequential domain adaptation framework for dynamic multi-modal sample selection
in ADA. We derive a query strategy to prioritize labeling and training on the
most valuable samples based on their informativeness and representativeness.
Empirical validation on diverse gross tumor volume segmentation tasks
demonstrates that our method achieves favorable segmentation performance,
significantly outperforming state-of-the-art ADA methods. Code is available at

Conclusion: 数据层面的早期融合策略能够更好地利用LiDAR和RGB图像的互补特性，通过视觉基础模型和迭代精细化策略可以生成质量更高的伪标签，为无监督3D检测提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Existing LiDAR-based 3D object detectors typically rely on manually annotated
labels for training to achieve good performance. However, obtaining
high-quality 3D labels is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this
issue, recent works explore unsupervised 3D object detection by introducing RGB
images as an auxiliary modal to assist pseudo-box generation. However, these
methods simply integrate pseudo-boxes generated by LiDAR point clouds and RGB
images. Yet, such a label-level fusion strategy brings limited improvements to
the quality of pseudo-boxes, as it overlooks the complementary nature in terms
of LiDAR and RGB image data. To overcome the above limitations, we propose a
novel data-level fusion framework that integrates RGB images and LiDAR data at
an early stage. Specifically, we utilize vision foundation models for instance
segmentation and depth estimation on images and introduce a bi-directional
fusion method, where real points acquire category labels from the 2D space,
while 2D pixels are projected onto 3D to enhance real point density. To
mitigate noise from depth and segmentation estimations, we propose a local and
global filtering method, which applies local radius filtering to suppress depth
estimation errors and global statistical filtering to remove
segmentation-induced outliers. Furthermore, we propose a data-level fusion
based dynamic self-evolution strategy, which iteratively refines pseudo-boxes
under a dense representation, significantly improving localization accuracy.
Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that the detector
trained by our method significantly outperforms that trained by previous
state-of-the-art methods with 28.4$\%$ mAP on the nuScenes validation
benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Abstract: Estimating Body Mass Index (BMI) from camera images with machine learning
models enables rapid weight assessment when traditional methods are unavailable
or impractical, such as in telehealth or emergency scenarios. Existing computer
vision approaches have been limited to datasets of up to 14,500 images. In this
study, we present a deep learning-based BMI estimation method trained on our
WayBED dataset, a large proprietary collection of 84,963 smartphone images from
25,353 individuals. We introduce an automatic filtering method that uses
posture clustering and person detection to curate the dataset by removing
low-quality images, such as those with atypical postures or incomplete views.
This process retained 71,322 high-quality images suitable for training. We
achieve a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 7.9% on our hold-out test
set (WayBED data) using full-body images, the lowest value in the published
literature to the best of our knowledge. Further, we achieve a MAPE of 13% on
the completely unseen~(during training) VisualBodyToBMI dataset, comparable
with state-of-the-art approaches trained on it, demonstrating robust
generalization. Lastly, we fine-tune our model on VisualBodyToBMI and achieve a
MAPE of 8.56%, the lowest reported value on this dataset so far. We deploy the
full pipeline, including image filtering and BMI estimation, on Android devices
using the CLAID framework. We release our complete code for model training,
filtering, and the CLAID package for mobile deployment as open-source
contributions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究通过557个模拟实验，系统评估了7种主流域适应技术在自然图像和医学图像分类中的表现，发现DSAN算法在COVID-19等医学数据集上表现优异，准确率达91.2%，在动态数据流场景中比基线提升6.7%，且具有较好的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 域适应技术可以缓解训练集和测试集之间的分布差异，但现有研究主要基于自然图像而非医学数据，且主流数据集可能导致性能偏差。为了更好地理解域适应技术在自然和医学图像中的效果，需要进行系统性评估。

Method: 使用7种广泛使用的域适应技术，在5个自然图像数据集和8个医学图像数据集上进行了557个模拟实验，涵盖了分布外、动态数据流和有限训练样本等多种场景。

Result: DSAN算法表现突出，在COVID-19数据集上使用Resnet50达到91.2%的分类准确率，在动态数据流域适应场景中比基线提升6.7%。DSAN在COVID-19和皮肤癌数据集上展现出显著的可解释性。

Conclusion: 研究结果有助于理解域适应技术，为模型在医学数据上的有效适应提供了宝贵见解，DSAN算法在医学图像分类中表现出优越性能和实用性。

Abstract: Domain adaptation (DA) techniques have the potential in machine learning to
alleviate distribution differences between training and test sets by leveraging
information from source domains. In image classification, most advances in DA
have been made using natural images rather than medical data, which are harder
to work with. Moreover, even for natural images, the use of mainstream datasets
can lead to performance bias. {With the aim of better understanding the
benefits of DA for both natural and medical images, this study performs 557
simulation studies using seven widely-used DA techniques for image
classification in five natural and eight medical datasets that cover various
scenarios, such as out-of-distribution, dynamic data streams, and limited
training samples.} Our experiments yield detailed results and insightful
observations highlighting the performance and medical applicability of these
techniques. Notably, our results have shown the outstanding performance of the
Deep Subdomain Adaptation Network (DSAN) algorithm. This algorithm achieved
feasible classification accuracy (91.2\%) in the COVID-19 dataset using
Resnet50 and showed an important accuracy improvement in the dynamic data
stream DA scenario (+6.7\%) compared to the baseline. Our results also
demonstrate that DSAN exhibits remarkable level of explainability when
evaluated on COVID-19 and skin cancer datasets. These results contribute to the
understanding of DA techniques and offer valuable insight into the effective
adaptation of models to medical data.

TL;DR: 提出CLAB方法，通过对比学习辅助分支增强视频目标检测的特征表示能力，采用动态损失权重策略，在ImageNet VID数据集上达到84.0-85.2% mAP的SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频目标检测面临运动模糊、遮挡和变形等图像退化问题，现有方法通常需要特征聚合和复杂后处理，但计算成本高。希望在不增加推理计算负担的情况下提升对图像退化的鲁棒性。

Method: 1. 使用对比损失实现对比学习辅助分支，增强主干网络特征表示能力；2. 提出动态损失权重策略，训练早期侧重辅助特征学习，后期逐渐侧重检测任务。

Result: 在ImageNet VID数据集上，ResNet-101达到84.0% mAP，ResNeXt-101达到85.2% mAP，实现了CNN模型的state-of-the-art性能，且无需额外后处理方法。

Conclusion: CLAB方法简单有效，通过对比学习和动态权重策略显著提升视频目标检测性能，在不增加推理计算成本的情况下实现了优异的检测精度。

Abstract: Video object detection is a challenging task because videos often suffer from
image deterioration such as motion blur, occlusion, and deformable shapes,
making it significantly more difficult than detecting objects in still images.
Prior approaches have improved video object detection performance by employing
feature aggregation and complex post-processing techniques, though at the cost
of increased computational demands. To improve robustness to image degradation
without additional computational load during inference, we introduce a
straightforward yet effective Contrastive Learning through Auxiliary Branch
(CLAB) method. First, we implement a constrastive auxiliary branch using a
contrastive loss to enhance the feature representation capability of the video
object detector's backbone. Next, we propose a dynamic loss weighting strategy
that emphasizes auxiliary feature learning early in training while gradually
prioritizing the detection task as training converges. We validate our approach
through comprehensive experiments and ablation studies, demonstrating
consistent performance gains. Without bells and whistles, CLAB reaches a
performance of 84.0% mAP and 85.2% mAP with ResNet-101 and ResNeXt-101,
respectively, on the ImageNet VID dataset, thus achieving state-of-the-art
performance for CNN-based models without requiring additional post-processing
methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文分析了CLIP视觉编码器在排版攻击下的行为，发现特定注意力头负责提取和传递排版信息，并提出了一种无需微调的防御方法，通过选择性消融注意力头电路来提升模型对抗排版攻击的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 排版攻击通过向图像中注入文本来操纵多模态系统，导致目标误分类、恶意内容生成和视觉语言模型越狱。需要研究CLIP模型在这种攻击下的行为并开发有效的防御方法。

Method: 分析CLIP视觉编码器在排版攻击下的注意力机制，定位专门处理排版信息的注意力头，然后通过选择性消融这些注意力头组成的电路来防御攻击，无需微调模型。

Result: 该方法在ImageNet-100的排版变体上性能提升高达19.6%，同时标准ImageNet-100准确率下降不到1%。无需训练的防御方法与当前最先进的基于微调的防御方法竞争力相当。

Conclusion: 发布了一系列抗排版攻击的鲁棒CLIP模型（dyslexic CLIP），这些模型可作为安全关键应用的即插即用替代方案，在文本识别效用与文本操纵风险之间提供更好的平衡。

Abstract: Typographic attacks exploit multi-modal systems by injecting text into
images, leading to targeted misclassifications, malicious content generation
and even Vision-Language Model jailbreaks. In this work, we analyze how CLIP
vision encoders behave under typographic attacks, locating specialized
attention heads in the latter half of the model's layers that causally extract
and transmit typographic information to the cls token. Building on these
insights, we introduce a method to defend CLIP models against typographic
attacks by selectively ablating a typographic circuit, consisting of attention
heads. Without requiring finetuning, our method improves performance by up to
19.6% on a typographic variant of ImageNet-100, while reducing standard
ImageNet-100 accuracy by less than 1%. Notably, our training-free approach
remains competitive with current state-of-the-art typographic defenses that
rely on finetuning. To this end, we release a family of dyslexic CLIP models
which are significantly more robust against typographic attacks. These models
serve as suitable drop-in replacements for a broad range of safety-critical
applications, where the risks of text-based manipulation outweigh the utility
of text recognition.

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) is a crucial task in computer vision with
wide range of applications including human computer interaction, surveillance,
and assistive technologies. However, challenges such as occlusion, expression
variability, and lack of interpretability hinder the performance of traditional
FER systems. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a powerful alternative by
modeling relational dependencies between facial landmarks, enabling structured
and interpretable learning. In this paper, we propose GLaRE, a novel
Graph-based Landmark Region Embedding network for emotion recognition. Facial
landmarks are extracted using 3D facial alignment, and a quotient graph is
constructed via hierarchical coarsening to preserve spatial structure while
reducing complexity. Our method achieves 64.89 percentage accuracy on AffectNet
and 94.24 percentage on FERG, outperforming several existing baselines.
Additionally, ablation studies have demonstrated that region-level embeddings
from quotient graphs have contributed to improved prediction performance.

Method: 提出基于可缓存扩散架构的FastFit框架，采用半注意力机制，用类别嵌入替代传统时间步嵌入，实现参考特征编码与去噪过程的完全解耦，参考特征只需计算一次即可在所有步骤中无损重用

Result: 在VITON-HD、DressCode和新建的DressCode-MR数据集上的广泛实验表明，FastFit在关键保真度指标上超越最先进方法，同时提供显著推理效率优势，平均获得3.5倍加速

Conclusion: FastFit通过创新的可缓存扩散架构成功解决了多参考虚拟试穿的效率和性能问题，为复杂多参考虚拟试穿研究提供了有效解决方案和高质量数据集支持

Abstract: Despite its great potential, virtual try-on technology is hindered from
real-world application by two major challenges: the inability of current
methods to support multi-reference outfit compositions (including garments and
accessories), and their significant inefficiency caused by the redundant
re-computation of reference features in each denoising step. To address these
challenges, we propose FastFit, a high-speed multi-reference virtual try-on
framework based on a novel cacheable diffusion architecture. By employing a
Semi-Attention mechanism and substituting traditional timestep embeddings with
class embeddings for reference items, our model fully decouples reference
feature encoding from the denoising process with negligible parameter overhead.
This allows reference features to be computed only once and losslessly reused
across all steps, fundamentally breaking the efficiency bottleneck and
achieving an average 3.5x speedup over comparable methods. Furthermore, to
facilitate research on complex, multi-reference virtual try-on, we introduce
DressCode-MR, a new large-scale dataset. It comprises 28,179 sets of
high-quality, paired images covering five key categories (tops, bottoms,
dresses, shoes, and bags), constructed through a pipeline of expert models and
human feedback refinement. Extensive experiments on the VITON-HD, DressCode,
and our DressCode-MR datasets show that FastFit surpasses state-of-the-art
methods on key fidelity metrics while offering its significant advantage in
inference efficiency.

Conclusion: UTA-Sign方法有效解决了热成像的标志盲点和事件相机非均匀采样问题，为低光照环境下的自动驾驶提供了可靠的交通标志感知解决方案

Abstract: The thermal camera excels at perceiving outdoor environments under low-light
conditions, making it ideal for applications such as nighttime autonomous
driving and unmanned navigation. However, thermal cameras encounter challenges
when capturing signage from objects made of similar materials, which can pose
safety risks for accurately understanding semantics in autonomous driving
systems. In contrast, the neuromorphic vision camera, also known as an event
camera, detects changes in light intensity asynchronously and has proven
effective in high-speed, low-light traffic environments. Recognizing the
complementary characteristics of these two modalities, this paper proposes
UTA-Sign, an unsupervised thermal-event video augmentation for traffic signage
in low-illumination environments, targeting elements such as license plates and
roadblock indicators. To address the signage blind spots of thermal imaging and
the non-uniform sampling of event cameras, we developed a dual-boosting
mechanism that fuses thermal frames and event signals for consistent signage
representation over time. The proposed method utilizes thermal frames to
provide accurate motion cues as temporal references for aligning the uneven
event signals. At the same time, event signals contribute subtle signage
content to the raw thermal frames, enhancing the overall understanding of the
environment. The proposed method is validated on datasets collected from
real-world scenarios, demonstrating superior quality in traffic signage
sketching and improved detection accuracy at the perceptual level.

Conclusion: 提出的主动防御方法通过低频扰动有效破坏了深度伪造的生成过程，为预防深度伪造攻击提供了新的解决方案，具有实际应用价值

Abstract: Deepfake technology, driven by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), poses
significant risks to privacy and societal security. Existing detection methods
are predominantly passive, focusing on post-event analysis without preventing
attacks. To address this, we propose an active defense method based on
low-frequency perceptual perturbations to disrupt face swapping manipulation,
reducing the performance and naturalness of generated content. Unlike prior
approaches that used low-frequency perturbations to impact classification
accuracy,our method directly targets the generative process of deepfake
techniques. We combine frequency and spatial domain features to strengthen
defenses. By introducing artifacts through low-frequency perturbations while
preserving high-frequency details, we ensure the output remains visually
plausible. Additionally, we design a complete architecture featuring an
encoder, a perturbation generator, and a decoder, leveraging discrete wavelet
transform (DWT) to extract low-frequency components and generate perturbations
that disrupt facial manipulation models. Experiments on CelebA-HQ and LFW
demonstrate significant reductions in face-swapping effectiveness, improved
defense success rates, and preservation of visual quality.

Abstract: Generating 3D human motions from text is a challenging yet valuable task. The
key aspects of this task are ensuring text-motion consistency and achieving
generation diversity. Although recent advancements have enabled the generation
of precise and high-quality human motions from text, achieving diversity in the
generated motions remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we aim to
overcome the above challenge by designing a simple yet effective text-to-motion
generation method, \textit{i.e.}, Diverse-T2M. Our method introduces
uncertainty into the generation process, enabling the generation of highly
diverse motions while preserving the semantic consistency of the text.
Specifically, we propose a novel perspective that utilizes noise signals as
carriers of diversity information in transformer-based methods, facilitating a
explicit modeling of uncertainty. Moreover, we construct a latent space where
text is projected into a continuous representation, instead of a rigid
one-to-one mapping, and integrate a latent space sampler to introduce
stochastic sampling into the generation process, thereby enhancing the
diversity and uncertainty of the outputs. Our results on text-to-motion
generation benchmark datasets~(HumanML3D and KIT-ML) demonstrate that our
method significantly enhances diversity while maintaining state-of-the-art
performance in text consistency.

Abstract: Intraoperative ultrasound images are inherently challenging to interpret in
liver surgery due to the limited field of view and complex anatomical
structures. Bridging the gap between preoperative and intraoperative data is
crucial for effective surgical guidance. 3D IntraVascular UltraSound (IVUS)
offers a potential solution by enabling the reconstruction of the entire organ,
which facilitates registration between preoperative computed tomography (CT)
scans and intraoperative IVUS images. In this work, we propose an
optimization-based calibration method using a 3D-printed phantom for accurate
3D Intravascular Ultrasound volume reconstruction. Our approach ensures precise
alignment of tracked IVUS data with preoperative CT images, improving
intraoperative navigation. We validated our method using in vivo swine liver
images, achieving a calibration error from 0.88 to 1.80 mm and a registration
error from 3.40 to 5.71 mm between the 3D IVUS data and the corresponding CT
scan. Our method provides a reliable and accurate means of calibration and
volume reconstruction. It can be used to register intraoperative ultrasound
images with preoperative CT images in the context of liver surgery, and enhance
intraoperative guidance.

Abstract: In semiconductor manufacturing, defect detection and localization are
critical to ensuring product quality and yield. While X-ray imaging is a
reliable non-destructive testing method, it is memory-intensive and
time-consuming for large-scale scanning, Magnetic Field Imaging (MFI) offers a
more efficient means to localize regions of interest (ROI) for targeted X-ray
scanning. However, the limited availability of MFI datasets due to proprietary
concerns presents a significant bottleneck for training machine learning (ML)
models using MFI. To address this challenge, we consider an ML-driven approach
leveraging diffusion models with two physical constraints. We propose Physics
Informed Generative Models for Magnetic Field Images (PI-GenMFI) to generate
synthetic MFI samples by integrating specific physical information. We generate
MFI images for the most common defect types: power shorts. These synthetic
images will serve as training data for ML algorithms designed to localize
defect areas efficiently. To evaluate generated MFIs, we compare our model to
SOTA generative models from both variational autoencoder (VAE) and diffusion
methods. We present a domain expert evaluation to assess the generated samples.
In addition, we present qualitative and quantitative evaluation using various
metrics used for image generation and signal processing, showing promising
results to optimize the defect localization process.

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了数据重构攻击的效果和通用性，对分开推理安全构成了更大的隐私风险

Abstract: The growing complexity of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has led to the adoption
of Split Inference (SI), a collaborative paradigm that partitions computation
between edge devices and the cloud to reduce latency and protect user privacy.
However, recent advances in Data Reconstruction Attacks (DRAs) reveal that
intermediate features exchanged in SI can be exploited to recover sensitive
input data, posing significant privacy risks. Existing DRAs are typically
effective only on shallow models and fail to fully leverage semantic priors,
limiting their reconstruction quality and generalizability across datasets and
model architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN-based DRA framework
with Progressive Feature Optimization (PFO), which decomposes the generator
into hierarchical blocks and incrementally refines intermediate representations
to enhance the semantic fidelity of reconstructed images. To stabilize the
optimization and improve image realism, we introduce an L1-ball constraint
during reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms
prior attacks by a large margin, especially in high-resolution scenarios,
out-of-distribution settings, and against deeper and more complex DNNs.

Abstract: Emotional talking head synthesis aims to generate talking portrait videos
with vivid expressions. Existing methods still exhibit limitations in control
flexibility, motion naturalness, and expression quality. Moreover, currently
available datasets are primarily collected in lab settings, further
exacerbating these shortcomings. Consequently, these limitations substantially
hinder practical applications in real-world scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose EmoCAST, a diffusion-based framework with two key
modules for precise text-driven emotional synthesis. In appearance modeling,
emotional prompts are integrated through a text-guided decoupled emotive
module, enhancing the spatial knowledge to improve emotion comprehension. To
improve the relationship between audio and emotion, we introduce an emotive
audio attention module to capture the interplay between controlled emotion and
driving audio, generating emotion-aware features to guide more precise facial
motion synthesis. Additionally, we construct an emotional talking head dataset
with comprehensive emotive text descriptions to optimize the framework's
performance. Based on the proposed dataset, we propose an emotion-aware
sampling training strategy and a progressive functional training strategy that
further improve the model's ability to capture nuanced expressive features and
achieve accurate lip-synchronization. Overall, EmoCAST achieves
state-of-the-art performance in generating realistic, emotionally expressive,
and audio-synchronized talking-head videos. Project Page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺癌是女性癌症相关死亡的主要原因，早期检测对改善预后至关重要。MRI对高风险或致密乳腺组织女性的检测特别有效，但需要AI辅助提高诊断效率

Method: 开发基于SwinUNETR的深度学习框架，包含乳腺区域掩码、广泛数据增强和集成学习技术，使用多中心511个研究的数据集

Result: 在ODELIA联盟组织的多中心挑战中获得第二名，证明了该方法在临床乳腺MRI解读中的潜在价值

Conclusion: 该方法展现了良好的鲁棒性和泛化能力，代码已公开分享，有望支持临床乳腺癌诊断

Abstract: Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality in
women, and early detection is essential for improving outcomes. Magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) is a highly sensitive tool for breast cancer detection,
particularly in women at high risk or with dense breast tissue, where
mammography is less effective. The ODELIA consortium organized a multi-center
challenge to foster AI-based solutions for breast cancer diagnosis and
classification. The dataset included 511 studies from six European centers,
acquired on scanners from multiple vendors at both 1.5 T and 3 T. Each study
was labeled for the left and right breast as no lesion, benign lesion, or
malignant lesion. We developed a SwinUNETR-based deep learning framework that
incorporates breast region masking, extensive data augmentation, and ensemble
learning to improve robustness and generalizability. Our method achieved second
place on the challenge leaderboard, highlighting its potential to support
clinical breast MRI interpretation. We publicly share our codebase at

*Shiqi Xin,Xiaolin Zhang,Yanbin Liu,Peng Zhang,Caifeng Shan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AvatarBack是一个用于3D高斯头像重建的即插即用框架，通过生成身份一致的后视图伪图像和自适应空间对齐策略，解决了现有方法因依赖前视图图像而导致后脑区域重建质量差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于高斯泼溅的头像重建方法主要依赖前视图图像，导致后脑区域重建质量不佳，出现几何不一致、结构模糊和真实感降低等问题，限制了重建头像的保真度。

Method: 提出AvatarBack框架，包含两个核心技术：主题特定生成器（SSG）利用生成先验从稀疏前视图输入合成身份一致的后视图伪图像；自适应空间对齐策略（ASA）使用可学习变换矩阵优化合成视图与3D高斯表示之间的几何对齐。

Result: 在NeRSemble和K-hairstyle数据集上的实验表明，AvatarBack显著提升了后脑区域的重建质量，同时保持了前视图的保真度，重建的头像在不同运动下保持一致的视觉真实感且完全可动画化。

Conclusion: AvatarBack通过显式建模缺失的后脑区域，成功解决了3D高斯头像重建中的后脑质量问题，为完整一致的头像重建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Gaussian Splatting have significantly boosted the
reconstruction of head avatars, enabling high-quality facial modeling by
representing an 3D avatar as a collection of 3D Gaussians. However, existing
methods predominantly rely on frontal-view images, leaving the back-head poorly
constructed. This leads to geometric inconsistencies, structural blurring, and
reduced realism in the rear regions, ultimately limiting the fidelity of
reconstructed avatars. To address this challenge, we propose AvatarBack, a
novel plug-and-play framework specifically designed to reconstruct complete and
consistent 3D Gaussian avatars by explicitly modeling the missing back-head
regions. AvatarBack integrates two core technical innovations,i.e., the
Subject-specific Generator (SSG) and the Adaptive Spatial Alignment Strategy
(ASA). The former leverages a generative prior to synthesize
identity-consistent, plausible back-view pseudo-images from sparse frontal
inputs, providing robust multi-view supervision. To achieve precise geometric
alignment between these synthetic views and the 3D Gaussian representation, the
later employs learnable transformation matrices optimized during training,
effectively resolving inherent pose and coordinate discrepancies. Extensive
experiments on NeRSemble and K-hairstyle datasets, evaluated using geometric,
photometric, and GPT-4o-based perceptual metrics, demonstrate that AvatarBack
significantly enhances back-head reconstruction quality while preserving
frontal fidelity. Moreover, the reconstructed avatars maintain consistent
visual realism under diverse motions and remain fully animatable.

TL;DR: 本研究探索使用基础模型提升历史绘画中人物面部识别的性能，通过微调基础模型并将其嵌入与传统面部识别网络结合，显著超越了现有最先进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史绘画中的人物识别对艺术史研究很重要，但传统面部识别模型在处理绘画时面临领域偏移、风格变化等挑战，需要新的技术手段来提升识别准确性。

Method: 通过微调基础模型，并将其嵌入表示与传统面部识别网络的嵌入进行整合，构建了一个能够更好处理艺术作品中面部识别的混合方法。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法相比当前最先进方法取得了显著改进，基础模型能够有效弥补传统方法在处理艺术作品时的不足。

Conclusion: 基础模型在艺术面部识别领域具有巨大潜力，能够有效解决传统方法因领域偏移和艺术风格变化而导致的性能下降问题。

Abstract: Identifying sitters in historical paintings is a key task for art historians,
offering insight into their lives and how they chose to be seen. However, the
process is often subjective and limited by the lack of data and stylistic
variations. Automated facial recognition is capable of handling challenging
conditions and can assist, but while traditional facial recognition models
perform well on photographs, they struggle with paintings due to domain shift
and high intra-class variation. Artistic factors such as style, skill, intent,
and influence from other works further complicate recognition. In this work, we
investigate the potential of foundation models to improve facial recognition in
artworks. By fine-tuning foundation models and integrating their embeddings
with those from conventional facial recognition networks, we demonstrate
notable improvements over current state-of-the-art methods. Our results show
that foundation models can bridge the gap where traditional methods are
ineffective. Paper page at https://www.idiap.ch/paper/artface/

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CraftGraffiti是一个端到端的文本引导涂鸦生成框架，通过风格优先、身份保持的方法，在极端风格转换中保持面部身份识别性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在涂鸦这种高对比度、抽象的艺术形式中，面部特征的细微扭曲会消除主体的可识别性，破坏个人和文化真实性，因此需要解决极端风格转换中的身份保持问题。

Method: 使用LoRA微调的预训练扩散变换器进行涂鸦风格迁移，通过面部一致性自注意力机制增强身份嵌入，采用CLIP引导的提示扩展实现无关键点的姿态定制。

Result: 定量结果显示具有竞争力的面部特征一致性和最先进的美学评分，定性分析和现场部署证明了系统的实际创作影响力。

Conclusion: CraftGraffiti推进了身份尊重的AI辅助艺术目标，为创意AI应用中融合风格自由和可识别性提供了原则性方法。

Abstract: Preserving facial identity under extreme stylistic transformation remains a
major challenge in generative art. In graffiti, a high-contrast, abstract
medium, subtle distortions to the eyes, nose, or mouth can erase the subject's
recognizability, undermining both personal and cultural authenticity. We
present CraftGraffiti, an end-to-end text-guided graffiti generation framework
designed with facial feature preservation as a primary objective. Given an
input image and a style and pose descriptive prompt, CraftGraffiti first
applies graffiti style transfer via LoRA-fine-tuned pretrained diffusion
transformer, then enforces identity fidelity through a face-consistent
self-attention mechanism that augments attention layers with explicit identity
embeddings. Pose customization is achieved without keypoints, using CLIP-guided
prompt extension to enable dynamic re-posing while retaining facial coherence.
We formally justify and empirically validate the "style-first, identity-after"
paradigm, showing it reduces attribute drift compared to the reverse order.
Quantitative results demonstrate competitive facial feature consistency and
state-of-the-art aesthetic and human preference scores, while qualitative
analyses and a live deployment at the Cruilla Festival highlight the system's
real-world creative impact. CraftGraffiti advances the goal of
identity-respectful AI-assisted artistry, offering a principled approach for
blending stylistic freedom with recognizability in creative AI applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种生成去偏自评分数的新方法，让大型视觉语言模型能够自主评估和改进多模态对齐，减少幻觉并提高安全性，无需依赖外部数据集或人工标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型视觉语言模型对齐方法依赖外部数据集、人工标注或复杂后处理，导致可扩展性差、成本高，且容易产生幻觉和安全问题。

Method: 通过模型内部生成去偏自评分数作为自我评估指标，无需外部资源，改进解码策略和偏好调优过程，实现自主对齐改进。

Result: 实证结果显示该方法显著优于传统方法，有效减少幻觉、增强安全性并提升整体能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为大型视觉语言模型的对齐提供了更有效的解决方案，具有更好的可扩展性和实用性。

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large
Visual-Language Models (LVLMs) have opened up new opportunities for integrating
visual and linguistic modalities. However, effectively aligning these
modalities remains challenging, often leading to hallucinations--where
generated outputs are not grounded in the visual input--and raising safety
concerns across various domains. Existing alignment methods, such as
instruction tuning and preference tuning, often rely on external datasets,
human annotations, or complex post-processing, which limit scalability and
increase costs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that
generates the debiased self-judgment score, a self-evaluation metric created
internally by the model without relying on external resources. This enables the
model to autonomously improve alignment. Our method enhances both decoding
strategies and preference tuning processes, resulting in reduced
hallucinations, enhanced safety, and improved overall capability. Empirical
results show that our approach significantly outperforms traditional methods,
offering a more effective solution for aligning LVLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了S-HArM多模态数据集用于意图感知分类，包含9576个社交媒体图像-文本对，标注为幽默/讽刺、艺术或虚假信息。通过三种提示策略构建合成训练数据，实验表明保留视觉上下文的图像引导和多模态引导方法泛化效果更好，但整体性能有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态AI在检测合成和上下文无关内容方面取得进展，但忽略了AI生成图像背后的意图识别，需要填补这一研究空白。

Method: 构建S-HArM数据集（9576个真实社交媒体图像-文本对），探索三种提示策略（图像引导、描述引导、多模态引导）使用Stable Diffusion构建大规模合成训练数据，比较多种模型架构包括模态融合、对比学习、重建网络、注意力机制和大规模视觉语言模型。

Result: 在图像引导和多模态引导策略下训练的模型对真实内容泛化效果更好，因为保留了视觉上下文。但整体性能仍然有限，表明推断意图的复杂性。

Conclusion: 推断AI生成图像意图具有挑战性，需要专门的架构设计。保留视觉上下文的训练策略有助于提升模型泛化能力，但该领域仍需进一步研究。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal AI have enabled progress in detecting synthetic
and out-of-context content. However, existing efforts largely overlook the
intent behind AI-generated images. To fill this gap, we introduce S-HArM, a
multimodal dataset for intent-aware classification, comprising 9,576 "in the
wild" image-text pairs from Twitter/X and Reddit, labeled as Humor/Satire, Art,
or Misinformation. Additionally, we explore three prompting strategies
(image-guided, description-guided, and multimodally-guided) to construct a
large-scale synthetic training dataset with Stable Diffusion. We conduct an
extensive comparative study including modality fusion, contrastive learning,
reconstruction networks, attention mechanisms, and large vision-language
models. Our results show that models trained on image- and multimodally-guided
data generalize better to "in the wild" content, due to preserved visual
context. However, overall performance remains limited, highlighting the
complexity of inferring intent and the need for specialized architectures.

Result: MobileCLIP2在ImageNet-1k零样本准确率上取得SOTA性能，MobileCLIP2-B相比MobileCLIP-B提升2.2%准确率，MobileCLIP2-S4在2倍更小模型尺寸下达到SigLIP-SO400M/14的准确率

Conclusion: 通过改进的多模态强化训练方法，MobileCLIP2在保持低延迟的同时显著提升了零样本性能，为移动端视觉-语言模型提供了新的技术方案

Abstract: Foundation image-text models such as CLIP with zero-shot capabilities enable
a wide array of applications. MobileCLIP is a recent family of image-text
models at 3-15ms latency and 50-150M parameters with state-of-the-art zero-shot
accuracy. The main ingredients in MobileCLIP were its low-latency and light
architectures and a novel multi-modal reinforced training that made knowledge
distillation from multiple caption-generators and CLIP teachers efficient,
scalable, and reproducible. In this paper, we improve the multi-modal
reinforced training of MobileCLIP through: 1) better CLIP teacher ensembles
trained on the DFN dataset, 2) improved captioner teachers trained on the DFN
dataset and fine-tuned on a diverse selection of high-quality image-caption
datasets. We discover new insights through ablations such as the importance of
temperature tuning in contrastive knowledge distillation, the effectiveness of
caption-generator fine-tuning for caption diversity, and the additive
improvement from combining synthetic captions generated by multiple models. We
train a new family of models called MobileCLIP2 and achieve state-of-the-art
ImageNet-1k zero-shot accuracies at low latencies. In particular, we observe
2.2% improvement in ImageNet-1k accuracy for MobileCLIP2-B compared with
MobileCLIP-B architecture. Notably, MobileCLIP2-S4 matches the zero-shot
accuracy of SigLIP-SO400M/14 on ImageNet-1k while being 2$\times$ smaller and
improves on DFN ViT-L/14 at 2.5$\times$ lower latency. We release our
pretrained models (https://github.com/apple/ml-mobileclip) and the data
generation code (https://github.com/apple/ml-mobileclip-dr). The data
generation code makes it easy to create new reinforced datasets with arbitrary
teachers using distributed scalable processing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经视频压缩虽然性能显著，但学习型编解码器存在固有的比特率控制限制，需要解决可变比特率场景下的精确控制问题

Method: 提出动态路由自编码器（DRA）和速率控制代理，采用联合路由优化策略进行协同训练，实现可变编码路径和实时比特率调整

Result: 在HEVC和UVG数据集上平均BD-Rate降低14.8%，BD-PSNR增益0.47dB，平均比特率误差仅1.66%

Conclusion: 该方法实现了速率-失真-复杂度优化（RDCO），适用于各种比特率和比特率受限的应用场景

Abstract: Neural Video Compression (NVC) has achieved remarkable performance in recent
years. However, precise rate control remains a challenge due to the inherent
limitations of learning-based codecs. To solve this issue, we propose a dynamic
video compression framework designed for variable bitrate scenarios. First, to
achieve variable bitrate implementation, we propose the Dynamic-Route
Autoencoder with variable coding routes, each occupying partial computational
complexity of the whole network and navigating to a distinct RD trade-off.
Second, to approach the target bitrate, the Rate Control Agent estimates the
bitrate of each route and adjusts the coding route of DRA at run time. To
encompass a broad spectrum of variable bitrates while preserving overall RD
performance, we employ the Joint-Routes Optimization strategy, achieving
collaborative training of various routes. Extensive experiments on the HEVC and
UVG datasets show that the proposed method achieves an average BD-Rate
reduction of 14.8% and BD-PSNR gain of 0.47dB over state-of-the-art methods
while maintaining an average bitrate error of 1.66%, achieving
Rate-Distortion-Complexity Optimization (RDCO) for various bitrate and
bitrate-constrained applications. Our code is available at

TL;DR: CardioMorphNet是一种基于贝叶斯深度学习的3D心脏运动估计框架，通过形状引导的配准方法，避免了传统强度相似性损失的局限性，在心脏运动估计方面表现出优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有心脏运动估计方法依赖基于强度的图像配准相似性损失，往往忽略心脏解剖区域，导致运动估计不准确。需要一种能够专注于解剖区域的方法来提高心脏运动估计的准确性。

Method: 提出CardioMorphNet，一种循环贝叶斯深度学习框架，使用循环变分自编码器建模心脏周期的时空依赖性，通过两个后验模型进行双心室分割和运动估计，利用分割图进行递归配准而不使用基于强度的相似性损失。

Result: 在UK Biobank数据集上验证，CardioMorphNet在心脏运动估计方面表现出优越性能，超越了最先进方法。不确定性评估显示其在心脏区域产生较低的不确定性值，表明预测置信度更高。

Conclusion: CardioMorphNet通过形状引导的配准方法和贝叶斯建模，成功解决了传统心脏运动估计方法的局限性，提供了更准确和可信的心脏运动估计结果。

Abstract: Accurate cardiac motion estimation from cine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)
images is vital for assessing cardiac function and detecting its abnormalities.
Existing methods often struggle to capture heart motion accurately because they
rely on intensity-based image registration similarity losses that may overlook
cardiac anatomical regions. To address this, we propose CardioMorphNet, a
recurrent Bayesian deep learning framework for 3D cardiac shape-guided
deformable registration using short-axis (SAX) CMR images. It employs a
recurrent variational autoencoder to model spatio-temporal dependencies over
the cardiac cycle and two posterior models for bi-ventricular segmentation and
motion estimation. The derived loss function from the Bayesian formulation
guides the framework to focus on anatomical regions by recursively registering
segmentation maps without using intensity-based image registration similarity
loss, while leveraging sequential SAX volumes and spatio-temporal features. The
Bayesian modelling also enables computation of uncertainty maps for the
estimated motion fields. Validated on the UK Biobank dataset by comparing
warped mask shapes with ground truth masks, CardioMorphNet demonstrates
superior performance in cardiac motion estimation, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods. Uncertainty assessment shows that it also yields
lower uncertainty values for estimated motion fields in the cardiac region
compared with other probabilistic-based cardiac registration methods,
indicating higher confidence in its predictions.

Abstract: Atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) are important histopathological markers yet
remain challenging to identify consistently, particularly under domain shift
stemming from scanner, stain, and acquisition differences. We present a simple
training-time recipe for domain-robust AMF classification in MIDOG 2025 Task 2.
The approach (i) increases feature diversity via style perturbations inserted
at early and mid backbone stages, (ii) aligns attention-refined features across
sites using weak domain labels (Scanner, Origin, Species, Tumor) through an
auxiliary alignment loss, and (iii) stabilizes predictions by distilling from
an exponential moving average (EMA) teacher with temperature-scaled KL
divergence. On the organizer-run preliminary leaderboard for atypical mitosis
classification, our submission attains balanced accuracy of 0.8762, sensitivity
of 0.8873, specificity of 0.8651, and ROC AUC of 0.9499. The method incurs
negligible inference-time overhead, relies only on coarse domain metadata, and
delivers strong, balanced performance, positioning it as a competitive
submission for the MIDOG 2025 challenge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于点式奖励模型的T2I生成方法容易受到奖励破解影响，微小分数差异在归一化后被放大，导致模型过度优化琐碎增益而破坏生成稳定性

Method: Pref-GRPO采用成对偏好奖励方法，在每组图像内进行成对比较，使用胜率作为奖励信号，将优化目标从分数最大化转向偏好拟合

Result: 实验表明Pref-GRPO能更好区分细微图像质量差异，提供更稳定的优势并缓解奖励破解。UniGenBench基准揭示了开源和闭源T2I模型的优缺点

Conclusion: Pref-GRPO方法有效解决了T2I生成中的奖励不稳定问题，配合UniGenBench综合评估框架，为文本到图像生成提供了更可靠的训练和评估方案

Abstract: Recent advancements highlight the importance of GRPO-based reinforcement
learning methods and benchmarking in enhancing text-to-image (T2I) generation.
However, current methods using pointwise reward models (RM) for scoring
generated images are susceptible to reward hacking. We reveal that this happens
when minimal score differences between images are amplified after
normalization, creating illusory advantages that drive the model to
over-optimize for trivial gains, ultimately destabilizing the image generation
process. To address this, we propose Pref-GRPO, a pairwise preference
reward-based GRPO method that shifts the optimization objective from score
maximization to preference fitting, ensuring more stable training. In
Pref-GRPO, images are pairwise compared within each group using preference RM,
and the win rate is used as the reward signal. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PREF-GRPO differentiates subtle image quality differences,
providing more stable advantages and mitigating reward hacking. Additionally,
existing T2I benchmarks are limited by coarse evaluation criteria, hindering
comprehensive model assessment. To solve this, we introduce UniGenBench, a
unified T2I benchmark comprising 600 prompts across 5 main themes and 20
subthemes. It evaluates semantic consistency through 10 primary and 27
sub-criteria, leveraging MLLM for benchmark construction and evaluation. Our
benchmarks uncover the strengths and weaknesses of both open and closed-source
T2I models and validate the effectiveness of Pref-GRPO.

Conclusion: 该框架通过改进特征融合实现了照片级真实感合成，代码已开源。

Abstract: Generalizable Gaussian Splatting aims to synthesize novel views for unseen
scenes without per-scene optimization. In particular, recent advancements
utilize feed-forward networks to predict per-pixel Gaussian parameters,
enabling high-quality synthesis from sparse input views. However, existing
approaches fall short in encoding discriminative, multi-view consistent
features for Gaussian predictions, which struggle to construct accurate
geometry with sparse views. To address this, we propose $\mathbf{C}^{3}$-GS, a
framework that enhances feature learning by incorporating context-aware,

lightweight modules into a unified rendering pipeline, improving feature fusion
and enabling photorealistic synthesis without requiring additional supervision.

TL;DR: SeqVLM是一个新颖的零样本3D视觉定位框架，通过多视角真实场景图像和空间信息进行目标物体推理，在ScanRefer和Nr3D基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有零样本3D视觉定位方法面临的单视角定位依赖、空间推理受限以及上下文信息缺失或细节退化等问题，提升真实世界应用的泛化能力。

Method: 首先通过3D语义分割网络生成3D实例提案并进行语义过滤，然后采用提案引导的多视角投影策略将候选提案投影到真实场景图像序列中，最后通过动态调度机制迭代处理序列查询提示，利用VLM的跨模态推理能力识别文本指定的对象。

Conclusion: SeqVLM框架显著提升了零样本3D视觉定位的性能，推动了3DVG向更好泛化能力和真实世界适用性的发展。

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) aims to localize objects in 3D scenes using
natural language descriptions. Although supervised methods achieve higher
accuracy in constrained settings, zero-shot 3DVG holds greater promise for
real-world applications since eliminating scene-specific training requirements.
However, existing zero-shot methods face challenges of spatial-limited
reasoning due to reliance on single-view localization, and contextual omissions
or detail degradation. To address these issues, we propose SeqVLM, a novel
zero-shot 3DVG framework that leverages multi-view real-world scene images with
spatial information for target object reasoning. Specifically, SeqVLM first
generates 3D instance proposals via a 3D semantic segmentation network and
refines them through semantic filtering, retaining only semantic-relevant
candidates. A proposal-guided multi-view projection strategy then projects
these candidate proposals onto real scene image sequences, preserving spatial
relationships and contextual details in the conversion process of 3D point
cloud to images. Furthermore, to mitigate VLM computational overload, we
implement a dynamic scheduling mechanism that iteratively processes
sequances-query prompts, leveraging VLM's cross-modal reasoning capabilities to
identify textually specified objects. Experiments on the ScanRefer and Nr3D
benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving Acc@0.25 scores
of 55.6% and 53.2%, surpassing previous zero-shot methods by 4.0% and 5.2%,
respectively, which advance 3DVG toward greater generalization and real-world
applicability. The code is available at https://github.com/JiawLin/SeqVLM.

TL;DR: CLIP模型在军事环境中的遮挡鲁棒性研究，发现Transformer架构优于CNN，分散遮挡比集中遮挡影响更大，微调可显著提升遮挡容忍度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索CLIP视觉语言模型在军事应用场景（存在部分遮挡和低信噪比）中的鲁棒性，填补该领域的研究空白

Method: 使用18类军事车辆自定义数据集，通过不同遮挡百分比评估CLIP变体的性能，采用归一化曲线下面积(NAUC)作为评估指标

Result: Transformer-based CLIP优于CNN；细粒度分散遮挡比大块连续遮挡影响更大；线性探测模型在35%遮挡时性能骤降；微调后性能下降推迟到60%遮挡

Conclusion: 需要在训练中加入遮挡特定增强，并进一步研究补丁级敏感性和架构韧性，以提升CLIP在真实军事部署中的实用性

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP enable zero-shot classification by
aligning images and text in a shared embedding space, offering advantages for
defense applications with scarce labeled data. However, CLIP's robustness in
challenging military environments, with partial occlusion and degraded
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), remains underexplored. We investigate CLIP
variants' robustness to occlusion using a custom dataset of 18 military vehicle
classes and evaluate using Normalized Area Under the Curve (NAUC) across
occlusion percentages. Four key insights emerge: (1) Transformer-based CLIP
models consistently outperform CNNs, (2) fine-grained, dispersed occlusions
degrade performance more than larger contiguous occlusions, (3) despite
improved accuracy, performance of linear-probed models sharply drops at around
35% occlusion, (4) by finetuning the model's backbone, this performance drop
occurs at more than 60% occlusion. These results underscore the importance of
occlusion-specific augmentations during training and the need for further
exploration into patch-level sensitivity and architectural resilience for
real-world deployment of CLIP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发具有像素级上下文感知能力的端到端自动驾驶模型，以更好地理解复杂环境模式。

Method: 采用Swin Transformer和跳跃阶段机制，通过SW-MSA机制提取远距离像素信息，并在特征提取全过程保留关键信息。

Result: 在CARLA平台的对抗场景测试中，SKGE-Swin架构获得了比先前方法更优越的驾驶评分。

Conclusion: 该架构通过全局和多层次特征表示，有效提升了自动驾驶模型的环境理解能力，未来将通过消融研究验证各组件贡献。

Abstract: Focusing on the development of an end-to-end autonomous vehicle model with
pixel-to-pixel context awareness, this research proposes the SKGE-Swin
architecture. This architecture utilizes the Swin Transformer with a skip-stage
mechanism to broaden feature representation globally and at various network
levels. This approach enables the model to extract information from distant
pixels by leveraging the Swin Transformer's Shifted Window-based Multi-head
Self-Attention (SW-MSA) mechanism and to retain critical information from the
initial to the final stages of feature extraction, thereby enhancing its
capability to comprehend complex patterns in the vehicle's surroundings. The
model is evaluated on the CARLA platform using adversarial scenarios to
simulate real-world conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the
SKGE-Swin architecture achieves a superior Driving Score compared to previous
methods. Furthermore, an ablation study will be conducted to evaluate the
contribution of each architectural component, including the influence of skip
connections and the use of the Swin Transformer, in improving model
performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文探讨了视频内容中抽象概念识别的挑战，认为基础模型的发展为解决这一难题提供了理想条件，并呼吁借鉴数十年社区经验来避免重复造轮子。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然机器在视频内容理解方面取得显著进展，能够识别具体实体如物体、动作等，但人类独有的抽象概念识别能力（如正义、自由等）仍是开放挑战。自动理解高级抽象概念对于使模型更符合人类推理和价值观至关重要。

Method: 本文采用文献综述方法，研究了用于理解视频内容中抽象概念的不同任务和数据集，分析了研究人员在不同时期利用可用工具解决这些任务的尝试。

Result: 研究发现基础模型的进步为解决视频抽象概念理解提供了新的机遇，但需要借鉴过去数十年的社区经验来有效推进这一重要挑战。

Conclusion: 在多媒体基础模型时代重新审视抽象概念理解时，应该充分利用社区积累的经验和知识，避免重复工作，从而更好地解决这一重大开放挑战。

Abstract: The automatic understanding of video content is advancing rapidly. Empowered
by deeper neural networks and large datasets, machines are increasingly capable
of understanding what is concretely visible in video frames, whether it be
objects, actions, events, or scenes. In comparison, humans retain a unique
ability to also look beyond concrete entities and recognize abstract concepts
like justice, freedom, and togetherness. Abstract concept recognition forms a
crucial open challenge in video understanding, where reasoning on multiple
semantic levels based on contextual information is key. In this paper, we argue
that the recent advances in foundation models make for an ideal setting to
address abstract concept understanding in videos. Automated understanding of
high-level abstract concepts is imperative as it enables models to be more
aligned with human reasoning and values. In this survey, we study different
tasks and datasets used to understand abstract concepts in video content. We
observe that, periodically and over a long period, researchers have attempted
to solve these tasks, making the best use of the tools available at their
disposal. We advocate that drawing on decades of community experience will help
us shed light on this important open grand challenge and avoid ``re-inventing
the wheel'' as we start revisiting it in the era of multi-modal foundation
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可解释性方法存在可靠性问题，LIME方法不一致，CAM方法未考虑所有类别，医疗实践中需要可信赖、可解释的诊断

Method: 全局类别激活概率图评估(GCAPME)，概率化分析所有类别的像素级激活概率图，统一可视化诊断过程，结合SafeML技术检测误诊

Result: 在ISIC数据集上使用MobileNetV2和Vision Transformers进行评估

Conclusion: 该方法有助于降低误诊风险，提高诊断可靠性和患者安全性

Abstract: Recent advancements in skin lesion classification models have significantly
improved accuracy, with some models even surpassing dermatologists' diagnostic
performance. However, in medical practice, distrust in AI models remains a
challenge. Beyond high accuracy, trustworthy, explainable diagnoses are
essential. Existing explainability methods have reliability issues, with
LIME-based methods suffering from inconsistency, while CAM-based methods
failing to consider all classes. To address these limitations, we propose
Global Class Activation Probabilistic Map Evaluation, a method that analyses
all classes' activation probability maps probabilistically and at a pixel
level. By visualizing the diagnostic process in a unified manner, it helps
reduce the risk of misdiagnosis. Furthermore, the application of SafeML
enhances the detection of false diagnoses and issues warnings to doctors and
patients as needed, improving diagnostic reliability and ultimately patient
safety. We evaluated our method using the ISIC datasets with MobileNetV2 and
Vision Transformers.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文探讨了扩散分类器在组合泛化能力方面是否优于判别式模型（如CLIP和ViLT），特别是在对象-属性绑定和关系推理任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言语义的一个基本方面是能够从已知部分组合出新含义。虽然视觉语言模型（VLMs）取得了显著进展，但有证据表明它们在组合泛化方面存在困难，例如无法正确绑定对象属性和关系。

Method: 评估了三种模型（扩散分类器、CLIP和ViLT）在零样本学习（ZSL）和广义零样本学习（GZSL）设置下绑定对象属性和关系的能力，并分析了CLIP嵌入表示的特点。

Result: 扩散分类器和ViLT在概念绑定任务上表现良好，但所有模型在关系GZSL任务上都面临显著困难。CLIP嵌入分析表明，困难可能源于关系概念（如左右）的表示过于相似。

Conclusion: 虽然扩散分类器在某些组合任务上表现更好，但所有视觉语言模型在关系推理方面都面临根本性挑战，需要进一步改进关系概念的表示学习。

Abstract: A fundamental aspect of the semantics of natural language is that novel
meanings can be formed from the composition of previously known parts.
Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in recent years,
however, there is evidence that they are unable to perform this kind of
composition. For example, given an image of a red cube and a blue cylinder, a
VLM such as CLIP is likely to incorrectly label the image as a red cylinder or
a blue cube, indicating it represents the image as a `bag-of-words' and fails
to capture compositional semantics. Diffusion models have recently gained
significant attention for their impressive generative abilities, and zero-shot
classifiers based on diffusion models have been shown to perform competitively
with CLIP in certain compositional tasks. In this work we explore whether the
generative Diffusion Classifier has improved compositional generalisation
abilities compared to discriminative models. We assess three models --
Diffusion Classifier, CLIP, and ViLT -- on their ability to bind objects with
attributes and relations in both zero-shot learning (ZSL) and generalised
zero-shot learning (GZSL) settings. Our results show that the Diffusion
Classifier and ViLT perform well at concept binding tasks, but that all models
struggle significantly with the relational GZSL task, underscoring the broader
challenges VLMs face with relational reasoning. Analysis of CLIP embeddings
suggests that the difficulty may stem from overly similar representations of
relational concepts such as left and right. Code and dataset are available at:

Motivation: 现有点云配准方法忽略点方向和不确定性，对噪声和激进旋转敏感，需要大量训练数据和变换增强

Method: 使用虚拟视角相机参数从Lidar点云初始化surfel，通过SE(3)等变卷积核学习位置和旋转特征，包含等变卷积编码器、交叉注意力机制、全连接解码器和Huber损失

Result: 在室内外数据集上相比最先进方法表现出优越性和鲁棒性能

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理点云配准中的噪声和旋转问题，在真实点云扫描上具有鲁棒性

Abstract: Point cloud registration is crucial for ensuring 3D alignment consistency of
multiple local point clouds in 3D reconstruction for remote sensing or digital
heritage. While various point cloud-based registration methods exist, both
non-learning and learning-based, they ignore point orientations and point
uncertainties, making the model susceptible to noisy input and aggressive
rotations of the input point cloud like orthogonal transformation; thus, it
necessitates extensive training point clouds with transformation augmentations.
To address these issues, we propose a novel surfel-based pose learning
regression approach. Our method can initialize surfels from Lidar point cloud
using virtual perspective camera parameters, and learns explicit
$\mathbf{SE(3)}$ equivariant features, including both position and rotation
through $\mathbf{SE(3)}$ equivariant convolutional kernels to predict relative
transformation between source and target scans. The model comprises an
equivariant convolutional encoder, a cross-attention mechanism for similarity
computation, a fully-connected decoder, and a non-linear Huber loss.
Experimental results on indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate our model
superiority and robust performance on real point-cloud scans compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: DVCTNet通过双视图协同训练和特征融合，有效解决了牙科龋齿检测的挑战，为临床应用提供了可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate dental caries detection from panoramic X-rays plays a pivotal role
in preventing lesion progression. However, current detection methods often
yield suboptimal accuracy due to subtle contrast variations and diverse lesion
morphology of dental caries. In this work, inspired by the clinical workflow
where dentists systematically combine whole-image screening with detailed
tooth-level inspection, we present DVCTNet, a novel Dual-View Co-Training
network for accurate dental caries detection. Our DVCTNet starts with employing
automated tooth detection to establish two complementary views: a global view
from panoramic X-ray images and a local view from cropped tooth images. We then
pretrain two vision foundation models separately on the two views. The
global-view foundation model serves as the detection backbone, generating
region proposals and global features, while the local-view model extracts
detailed features from corresponding cropped tooth patches matched by the
region proposals. To effectively integrate information from both views, we
introduce a Gated Cross-View Attention (GCV-Atten) module that dynamically
fuses dual-view features, enhancing the detection pipeline by integrating the
fused features back into the detection model for final caries detection. To
rigorously evaluate our DVCTNet, we test it on a public dataset and further
validate its performance on a newly curated, high-precision dental caries
detection dataset, annotated using both intra-oral images and panoramic X-rays
for double verification. Experimental results demonstrate DVCTNet's superior
performance against existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on both datasets,
indicating the clinical applicability of our method. Our code and labeled
dataset are available at https://github.com/ShanghaiTech-IMPACT/DVCTNet.

*He Li,Xinyu Liu,Weihang Kong,Xingchen Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FusionCounting是一个新颖的多任务学习框架，将人群计数集成到可见光和红外图像融合过程中，通过动态损失权重和对抗训练提升融合质量和计数性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VIF方法主要优化融合图像质量，语义分割需要大量标注，目标检测在拥挤场景中面临边界框重叠和遮挡问题。RGB-T人群计数虽受关注但尚未与VIF整合。

Method: 提出多任务学习框架，利用人群计数提供密度信息指导图像融合。采用动态损失函数权重策略平衡任务贡献，并加入对抗训练增强鲁棒性。

Result: 在公开数据集上的实验表明，FusionCounting不仅提升了图像融合质量，还实现了优越的人群计数性能。

Conclusion: 将人群计数集成到VIF框架中是有效的，动态权重和对抗训练策略显著提升了模型在密集场景中的表现和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Most visible and infrared image fusion (VIF) methods focus primarily on
optimizing fused image quality. Recent studies have begun incorporating
downstream tasks, such as semantic segmentation and object detection, to
provide semantic guidance for VIF. However, semantic segmentation requires
extensive annotations, while object detection, despite reducing annotation
efforts compared with segmentation, faces challenges in highly crowded scenes
due to overlapping bounding boxes and occlusion. Moreover, although RGB-T crowd
counting has gained increasing attention in recent years, no studies have
integrated VIF and crowd counting into a unified framework. To address these
challenges, we propose FusionCounting, a novel multi-task learning framework
that integrates crowd counting into the VIF process. Crowd counting provides a
direct quantitative measure of population density with minimal annotation,
making it particularly suitable for dense scenes. Our framework leverages both
input images and population density information in a mutually beneficial
multi-task design. To accelerate convergence and balance tasks contributions,
we introduce a dynamic loss function weighting strategy. Furthermore, we
incorporate adversarial training to enhance the robustness of both VIF and
crowd counting, improving the model's stability and resilience to adversarial
attacks. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that
FusionCounting not only enhances image fusion quality but also achieves
superior crowd counting performance.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel pipeline for 2D keypoint estima- tion of surgical
tools by leveraging Vision Language Models (VLMs) fine- tuned using a low rank
adjusting (LoRA) technique. Unlike traditional Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) or Transformer-based approaches, which often suffer from overfitting in
small-scale medical datasets, our method harnesses the generalization
capabilities of pre-trained VLMs. We carefully design prompts to create an
instruction-tuning dataset and use them to align visual features with semantic
keypoint descriptions. Experimental results show that with only two epochs of
fine tuning, the adapted VLM outperforms the baseline models, demonstrating the
ef- fectiveness of LoRA in low-resource scenarios. This approach not only
improves keypoint detection performance, but also paves the way for future work
in 3D surgical hands and tools pose estimation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了PointDGRWKV，首个基于RWKV架构的域泛化点云分类框架，通过自适应几何标记移位和跨域关键特征分布对齐来解决RWKV在点云应用中遇到的空间扭曲和注意力偏移问题。


<details>

Motivation: 现有基于卷积网络、Transformer或Mamba架构的域泛化点云分类方法存在感受野有限、计算成本高或长程依赖建模不足的问题。RWKV架构具有线性复杂度、全局感受野和长程依赖优势，但直接应用于点云会遇到空间扭曲和注意力偏移挑战。

Method: 提出PointDGRWKV框架，包含两个关键模块：1) 自适应几何标记移位(Adaptive Geometric Token Shift)用于建模局部邻域结构，提升几何上下文感知；2) 跨域关键特征分布对齐(Cross-Domain key feature Distribution Alignment)通过对齐跨域关键特征分布来缓解注意力偏移。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，PointDGRWKV在域泛化点云分类任务上达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: PointDGRWKV成功地将RWKV架构应用于域泛化点云分类，通过创新的几何建模和分布对齐机制，在保持RWKV线性效率的同时，显著提升了模型的泛化能力和性能表现。

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) has been recently explored to enhance the
generalizability of Point Cloud Classification (PCC) models toward unseen
domains. Prior works are based on convolutional networks, Transformer or Mamba
architectures, either suffering from limited receptive fields or high
computational cost, or insufficient long-range dependency modeling. RWKV, as an
emerging architecture, possesses superior linear complexity, global receptive
fields, and long-range dependency. In this paper, we present the first work
that studies the generalizability of RWKV models in DG PCC. We find that
directly applying RWKV to DG PCC encounters two significant challenges: RWKV's
fixed direction token shift methods, like Q-Shift, introduce spatial
distortions when applied to unstructured point clouds, weakening local
geometric modeling and reducing robustness. In addition, the Bi-WKV attention
in RWKV amplifies slight cross-domain differences in key distributions through
exponential weighting, leading to attention shifts and degraded generalization.
To this end, we propose PointDGRWKV, the first RWKV-based framework tailored
for DG PCC. It introduces two key modules to enhance spatial modeling and
cross-domain robustness, while maintaining RWKV's linear efficiency. In
particular, we present Adaptive Geometric Token Shift to model local
neighborhood structures to improve geometric context awareness. In addition,
Cross-Domain key feature Distribution Alignment is designed to mitigate
attention drift by aligning key feature distributions across domains. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that PointDGRWKV achieves
state-of-the-art performance on DG PCC.

Conclusion: PathMR展示了在AI驱动病理诊断中提高可解释性的潜力，为临床采用提供了透明和可追溯的决策依据。

Abstract: Deep learning based automated pathological diagnosis has markedly improved
diagnostic efficiency and reduced variability between observers, yet its
clinical adoption remains limited by opaque model decisions and a lack of
traceable rationale. To address this, recent multimodal visual reasoning
architectures provide a unified framework that generates segmentation masks at
the pixel level alongside semantically aligned textual explanations. By
localizing lesion regions and producing expert style diagnostic narratives,
these models deliver the transparent and interpretable insights necessary for
dependable AI assisted pathology. Building on these advancements, we propose
PathMR, a cell-level Multimodal visual Reasoning framework for Pathological
image analysis. Given a pathological image and a textual query, PathMR
generates expert-level diagnostic explanations while simultaneously predicting
cell distribution patterns. To benchmark its performance, we evaluated our
approach on the publicly available PathGen dataset as well as on our newly
developed GADVR dataset. Extensive experiments on these two datasets
demonstrate that PathMR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art visual
reasoning methods in text generation quality, segmentation accuracy, and
cross-modal alignment. These results highlight the potential of PathMR for
improving interpretability in AI-driven pathological diagnosis. The code will

Motivation: 胰腺导管腺癌（PDAC）是致死率极高的癌症，五年生存率低于10%，主要原因是晚期检测。需要开发早期检测方法来提高生存率

Method: 使用双模态成像（自发荧光和SHG）分析组织样本，评估6种深度学习架构（包括CNN和ViT），最终采用改进的ResNet架构，使用冻结预训练层和类别加权训练来解决数据集小和类别不平衡问题

Conclusion: 建立了一个强大的自动化PDAC检测流程，可以增强病理学家能力，并为扩展到其他癌症类型奠定基础，同时为小规模医学影像数据集应用深度学习提供了宝贵见解

Abstract: Pacreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most lethal forms
of cancer, with a five-year survival rate below 10% primarily due to late
detection. This research develops and validates a deep learning framework for
early PDAC detection through analysis of dual-modality imaging:
autofluorescence and second harmonic generation (SHG). We analyzed 40 unique
patient samples to create a specialized neural network capable of
distinguishing between normal, fibrotic, and cancerous tissue. Our methodology
evaluated six distinct deep learning architectures, comparing traditional
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with modern Vision Transformers (ViTs).
Through systematic experimentation, we identified and overcome significant
challenges in medical image analysis, including limited dataset size and class
imbalance. The final optimized framework, based on a modified ResNet
architecture with frozen pre-trained layers and class-weighted training,
achieved over 90% accuracy in cancer detection. This represents a significant
improvement over current manual analysis methods an demonstrates potential for
clinical deployment. This work establishes a robust pipeline for automated PDAC
detection that can augment pathologists' capabilities while providing a
foundation for future expansion to other cancer types. The developed
methodology also offers valuable insights for applying deep learning to
limited-size medical imaging datasets, a common challenge in clinical
applications.

Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning -- the practice of asking ``what if'' by varying
inputs and observing changes in model behavior -- has become central to
interpretable and fair AI. This thesis develops frameworks that use
counterfactuals to explain, audit, and mitigate bias in vision classifiers and
generative models. By systematically altering semantically meaningful
attributes while holding others fixed, these methods uncover spurious
correlations, probe causal dependencies, and help build more robust systems.
  The first part addresses vision classifiers. CAVLI integrates attribution
(LIME) with concept-level analysis (TCAV) to quantify how strongly decisions
rely on human-interpretable concepts. With localized heatmaps and a Concept
Dependency Score, CAVLI shows when models depend on irrelevant cues like
backgrounds. Extending this, ASAC introduces adversarial counterfactuals that
perturb protected attributes while preserving semantics. Through curriculum
learning, ASAC fine-tunes biased models for improved fairness and accuracy
while avoiding stereotype-laden artifacts.
  The second part targets generative Text-to-Image (TTI) models. TIBET provides
a scalable pipeline for evaluating prompt-sensitive biases by varying
identity-related terms, enabling causal auditing of how race, gender, and age
affect image generation. To capture interactions, BiasConnect builds causal
graphs diagnosing intersectional biases. Finally, InterMit offers a modular,
training-free algorithm that mitigates intersectional bias via causal
sensitivity scores and user-defined fairness goals.
  Together, these contributions show counterfactuals as a unifying lens for
interpretability, fairness, and causality in both discriminative and generative
models, establishing principled, scalable methods for socially responsible bias
evaluation and mitigation.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle perception typically relies on modular pipelines that
decompose the task into detection, tracking, and prediction. While
interpretable, these pipelines suffer from error accumulation and limited
inter-task synergy. Unified perception has emerged as a promising paradigm that
integrates these sub-tasks within a shared architecture, potentially improving
robustness, contextual reasoning, and efficiency while retaining interpretable
outputs. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of unified
perception, introducing a holistic and systemic taxonomy that categorizes
methods along task integration, tracking formulation, and representation flow.
We define three paradigms -Early, Late, and Full Unified Perception- and
systematically review existing methods, their architectures, training
strategies, datasets used, and open-source availability, while highlighting
future research directions. This work establishes the first comprehensive
framework for understanding and advancing unified perception, consolidates
fragmented efforts, and guides future research toward more robust,
generalizable, and interpretable perception.

Motivation: 有丝分裂像是肿瘤分级的重要生物标志物，但区分非典型有丝分裂像(AMFs)和正常有丝分裂像(NMFs)困难，人工标注耗时且主观

Method: 使用AUCMEDI训练ConvNeXtBase模型集成，并扩展基于规则的优化(RBR)模块

Result: 集成模型在MIDOG25初步测试集上平衡准确率84.02%；RBR提高了特异性但降低了敏感性和整体性能

Conclusion: 深度集成在AMF分类中表现良好，RBR可以提升特定指标但需要进一步研究

Abstract: Mitotic figures (MFs) are relevant biomarkers in tumor grading.
Differentiating atypical MFs (AMFs) from normal MFs (NMFs) remains difficult,
as manual annotation is time-consuming and subjective. In this work an ensemble
of ConvNeXtBase models was trained with AUCMEDI and extend with a rule-based
refinement (RBR) module. On the MIDOG25 preliminary test set, the ensemble
achieved a balanced accuracy of 84.02%. While the RBR increased specificity, it
reduced sensitivity and overall performance. The results show that deep
ensembles perform well for AMF classification. RBR can increase specific
metrics but requires further research.

Abstract: In the era of Industry 5.0, monitoring human activity is essential for
ensuring both ergonomic safety and overall well-being. While multi-camera
centralized setups improve pose estimation accuracy, they often suffer from
high computational costs and bandwidth requirements, limiting scalability and
real-time applicability. Distributing processing across edge devices can reduce
network bandwidth and computational load. On the other hand, the constrained
resources of edge devices lead to accuracy degradation, and the distribution of
computation leads to temporal and spatial inconsistencies. We address this
challenge by proposing COMETH (Convex Optimization for Multiview Estimation and
Tracking of Humans), a lightweight algorithm for real-time multi-view human
pose fusion that relies on three concepts: it integrates kinematic and
biomechanical constraints to increase the joint positioning accuracy; it
employs convex optimization-based inverse kinematics for spatial fusion; and it
implements a state observer to improve temporal consistency. We evaluate COMETH
on both public and industrial datasets, where it outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in localization, detection, and tracking accuracy. The proposed fusion
pipeline enables accurate and scalable human motion tracking, making it
well-suited for industrial and safety-critical applications. The code is
publicly available at https://github.com/PARCO-LAB/COMETH.

Abstract: Many high-performance networks were not designed with lightweight application
scenarios in mind from the outset, which has greatly restricted their scope of
application. This paper takes ConvNeXt as the research object and significantly
reduces the parameter scale and network complexity of ConvNeXt by integrating
the Cross Stage Partial Connections mechanism and a series of optimized

performance under different complexity configurations. The three core
innovations of E-ConvNeXt are : (1) integrating the Cross Stage Partial Network
(CSPNet) with ConvNeXt and adjusting the network structure, which reduces the
model's network complexity by up to 80%; (2) Optimizing the Stem and Block
structures to enhance the model's feature expression capability and operational
efficiency; (3) Replacing Layer Scale with channel attention. Experimental

Conclusion: 该方法有效缓解了数据稀缺问题，显著提升了多种模型在真实世界篡改基准上的性能，为图像篡改检测领域提供了重要数据资源

Abstract: Images manipulated using image editing tools can mislead viewers and pose
significant risks to social security. However, accurately localizing the
manipulated regions within an image remains a challenging problem. One of the
main barriers in this area is the high cost of data acquisition and the severe
lack of high-quality annotated datasets. To address this challenge, we
introduce novel methods that mitigate data scarcity by leveraging readily
available web data. We utilize a large collection of manually forged images
from the web, as well as automatically generated annotations derived from a
simpler auxiliary task, constrained image manipulation localization.
Specifically, we introduce a new paradigm CAAAv2, which automatically and
accurately annotates manipulated regions at the pixel level. To further improve
annotation quality, we propose a novel metric, QES, which filters out
unreliable annotations. Through CAAA v2 and QES, we construct MIMLv2, a
large-scale, diverse, and high-quality dataset containing 246,212 manually
forged images with pixel-level mask annotations. This is over 120x larger than
existing handcrafted datasets like IMD20. Additionally, we introduce Object
Jitter, a technique that further enhances model training by generating
high-quality manipulation artifacts. Building on these advances, we develop a
new model, Web-IML, designed to effectively leverage web-scale supervision for
the image manipulation localization task. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach substantially alleviates the data scarcity problem and
significantly improves the performance of various models on multiple real-world
forgery benchmarks. With the proposed web supervision, Web-IML achieves a
striking performance gain of 31% and surpasses previous SOTA TruFor by 24.1
average IoU points. The dataset and code will be made publicly available at

Abstract: Simulating detector responses is a crucial part of understanding the inner
workings of particle collisions in the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. Such
simulations are currently performed with statistical Monte Carlo methods, which
are computationally expensive and put a significant strain on CERN's
computational grid. Therefore, recent proposals advocate for generative machine
learning methods to enable more efficient simulations. However, the
distribution of the data varies significantly across the simulations, which is
hard to capture with out-of-the-box methods. In this study, we present
ExpertSim - a deep learning simulation approach tailored for the Zero Degree
Calorimeter in the ALICE experiment. Our method utilizes a
Mixture-of-Generative-Experts architecture, where each expert specializes in
simulating a different subset of the data. This allows for a more precise and
efficient generation process, as each expert focuses on a specific aspect of
the calorimeter response. ExpertSim not only improves accuracy, but also
provides a significant speedup compared to the traditional Monte-Carlo methods,
offering a promising solution for high-efficiency detector simulations in
particle physics experiments at CERN. We make the code available at

Conclusion: 该方法通过显式因果推理实现了透明且逻辑一致的推理，CCE可作为跨领域可重用的因果推理引擎

Abstract: Existing Causal-Why Video Question Answering (VideoQA) models often struggle
with higher-order reasoning, relying on opaque, monolithic pipelines that
entangle video understanding, causal inference, and answer generation. These
black-box approaches offer limited interpretability and tend to depend on
shallow heuristics. We propose a novel, modular framework that explicitly
decouples causal reasoning from answer generation, introducing natural language
causal chains as interpretable intermediate representations. Inspired by human
cognitive models, these structured cause-effect sequences bridge low-level
video content with high-level causal reasoning, enabling transparent and
logically coherent inference. Our two-stage architecture comprises a Causal
Chain Extractor (CCE) that generates causal chains from video-question pairs,
and a Causal Chain-Driven Answerer (CCDA) that produces answers grounded in
these chains. To address the lack of annotated reasoning traces, we introduce a
scalable method for generating high-quality causal chains from existing
datasets using large language models. We also propose CauCo, a new evaluation
metric for causality-oriented captioning. Experiments on three large-scale
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms state-of-the-art
models, but also yields substantial gains in explainability, user trust, and
generalization -- positioning the CCE as a reusable causal reasoning engine
across diverse domains. Project page:

Conclusion: POSE成功解决了大规模视频扩散模型的采样效率问题，实现了高质量单步视频生成，为视频生成领域提供了有效的加速解决方案。

Abstract: The field of video diffusion generation faces critical bottlenecks in
sampling efficiency, especially for large-scale models and long sequences.
Existing video acceleration methods adopt image-based techniques but suffer
from fundamental limitations: they neither model the temporal coherence of
video frames nor provide single-step distillation for large-scale video models.
To bridge this gap, we propose POSE (Phased One-Step Equilibrium), a
distillation framework that reduces the sampling steps of large-scale video
diffusion models, enabling the generation of high-quality videos in a single
step. POSE employs a carefully designed two-phase process to distill video
models:(i) stability priming: a warm-up mechanism to stabilize adversarial
distillation that adapts the high-quality trajectory of the one-step generator
from high to low signal-to-noise ratio regimes, optimizing the video quality of
single-step mappings near the endpoints of flow trajectories. (ii) unified
adversarial equilibrium: a flexible self-adversarial distillation mechanism
that promotes stable single-step adversarial training towards a Nash
equilibrium within the Gaussian noise space, generating realistic single-step
videos close to real videos. For conditional video generation, we propose (iii)
conditional adversarial consistency, a method to improve both semantic
consistency and frame consistency between conditional frames and generated
frames. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that POSE outperforms other
acceleration methods on VBench-I2V by average 7.15% in semantic alignment,
temporal conference and frame quality, reducing the latency of the pre-trained
model by 100$\times$, from 1000 seconds to 10 seconds, while maintaining
competitive performance.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models enable high-quality image generation but are
computationally expensive. While prior work optimizes per-inference efficiency,
we explore an orthogonal approach: reducing redundancy across correlated
prompts. Our method leverages the coarse-to-fine nature of diffusion models,
where early denoising steps capture shared structures among similar prompts. We
propose a training-free approach that clusters prompts based on semantic
similarity and shares computation in early diffusion steps. Experiments show
that for models trained conditioned on image embeddings, our approach
significantly reduces compute cost while improving image quality. By leveraging
UnClip's text-to-image prior, we enhance diffusion step allocation for greater
efficiency. Our method seamlessly integrates with existing pipelines, scales
with prompt sets, and reduces the environmental and financial burden of
large-scale text-to-image generation. Project page:

Abstract: Labeled handwriting data is often scarce, limiting the effectiveness of
recognition systems that require diverse, style-consistent training samples.
Handwriting synthesis offers a promising solution by generating artificial data
to augment training. However, current methods face two major limitations.
First, most are built on conventional convolutional architectures, which
struggle to model long-range dependencies and complex stroke patterns. Second,
they largely ignore the crucial role of frequency information, which is
essential for capturing fine-grained stylistic and structural details in
handwriting. To address these challenges, we propose FW-GAN, a one-shot
handwriting synthesis framework that generates realistic, writer-consistent
text from a single example. Our generator integrates a phase-aware Wave-MLP to
better capture spatial relationships while preserving subtle stylistic cues. We
further introduce a frequency-guided discriminator that leverages
high-frequency components to enhance the authenticity detection of generated
samples. Additionally, we introduce a novel Frequency Distribution Loss that
aligns the frequency characteristics of synthetic and real handwriting, thereby
enhancing visual fidelity. Experiments on Vietnamese and English handwriting
datasets demonstrate that FW-GAN generates high-quality, style-consistent
handwriting, making it a valuable tool for augmenting data in low-resource
handwriting recognition (HTR) pipelines. Official implementation is available

Maximizing Marginal Gains at both segment-level and token-level. Specifically,
we first divide the video into segments based on frame similarity, and then
dynamically allocate the token budget for each segment to maximize the marginal
gain of each segment. Subsequently, we propose a temporal-guided DPC algorithm
that jointly models inter-frame uniqueness and intra-frame diversity, thereby
maximizing the marginal gain of each token. By combining both stages, MMG-Vid
can maximize the utilization of the limited token budget, significantly
improving efficiency while maintaining strong performance. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MMG-Vid can maintain over 99.5% of the original
performance, while effectively reducing 75% visual tokens and accelerating the
prefilling stage by 3.9x on LLaVA-OneVision-7B. Code will be released soon.

*Wei Li,Renshan Zhang,Rui Shao,Jie He,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CogVLA是一个认知对齐的视觉-语言-动作框架，通过指令驱动路由和稀疏化技术，在提高效率的同时提升性能，相比OpenVLA减少2.5倍训练成本和2.8倍推理延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言-动作模型需要大量后训练，计算开销大，限制了可扩展性和部署。受人类多模态协调启发，需要更高效的框架。

Method: 采用3阶段渐进架构：1) EFA-Routing在视觉编码器中注入指令信息选择性聚合视觉token；2) LFP-Routing在语言模型中引入动作意图，修剪无关token实现稀疏化；3) V-L-A耦合注意力结合因果视觉-语言注意力和双向动作并行解码。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试和真实机器人任务中分别达到97.4%和70.0%的成功率，性能达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: CogVLA通过认知对齐设计实现了高效高性能的视觉-语言-动作建模，显著降低了计算成本，为实际部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models built on pre-trained
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) require extensive post-training, resulting in
high computational overhead that limits scalability and deployment.We propose
CogVLA, a Cognition-Aligned Vision-Language-Action framework that leverages
instruction-driven routing and sparsification to improve both efficiency and
performance. CogVLA draws inspiration from human multimodal coordination and
introduces a 3-stage progressive architecture. 1) Encoder-FiLM based
Aggregation Routing (EFA-Routing) injects instruction information into the
vision encoder to selectively aggregate and compress dual-stream visual tokens,
forming a instruction-aware latent representation. 2) Building upon this
compact visual encoding, LLM-FiLM based Pruning Routing (LFP-Routing)
introduces action intent into the language model by pruning
instruction-irrelevant visually grounded tokens, thereby achieving token-level
sparsity. 3) To ensure that compressed perception inputs can still support
accurate and coherent action generation, we introduce V-L-A Coupled Attention
(CAtten), which combines causal vision-language attention with bidirectional
action parallel decoding. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark and
real-world robotic tasks demonstrate that CogVLA achieves state-of-the-art
performance with success rates of 97.4% and 70.0%, respectively, while reducing
training costs by 2.5-fold and decreasing inference latency by 2.8-fold
compared to OpenVLA. CogVLA is open-sourced and publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出了HydraFake数据集和Veritas检测器，通过分层泛化测试和多模态大语言模型的模式感知推理来解决深度伪造检测在现实场景中的泛化问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学术基准与工业实践存在严重差异，训练源同质化且测试图像质量低，阻碍了检测器的实际部署

Method: 1) 构建HydraFake数据集，包含多样化深度伪造技术和野外伪造内容；2) 提出Veritas检测器，基于多模态大语言模型，采用模式感知推理（规划、自我反思等）模拟人类取证过程；3) 两阶段训练管道将深度伪造推理能力内化到MLLM中

Result: 实验显示先前检测器在跨模型场景中泛化良好，但在未见伪造技术和数据域上表现不足。Veritas在不同OOD场景中取得显著提升，并能提供透明可信的检测输出

Conclusion: HydraFake数据集和Veritas检测器有效解决了深度伪造检测在现实世界中的泛化挑战，为实际部署提供了可靠解决方案

Abstract: Deepfake detection remains a formidable challenge due to the complex and
evolving nature of fake content in real-world scenarios. However, existing
academic benchmarks suffer from severe discrepancies from industrial practice,
typically featuring homogeneous training sources and low-quality testing
images, which hinder the practical deployments of current detectors. To
mitigate this gap, we introduce HydraFake, a dataset that simulates real-world
challenges with hierarchical generalization testing. Specifically, HydraFake
involves diversified deepfake techniques and in-the-wild forgeries, along with
rigorous training and evaluation protocol, covering unseen model architectures,
emerging forgery techniques and novel data domains. Building on this resource,
we propose Veritas, a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) based deepfake
detector. Different from vanilla chain-of-thought (CoT), we introduce
pattern-aware reasoning that involves critical reasoning patterns such as
"planning" and "self-reflection" to emulate human forensic process. We further
propose a two-stage training pipeline to seamlessly internalize such deepfake
reasoning capacities into current MLLMs. Experiments on HydraFake dataset
reveal that although previous detectors show great generalization on
cross-model scenarios, they fall short on unseen forgeries and data domains.
Our Veritas achieves significant gains across different OOD scenarios, and is
capable of delivering transparent and faithful detection outputs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FakeParts是一种新型深度伪造技术，通过局部区域或时间段的细微修改来创建部分伪造视频，比传统深度伪造更具欺骗性。作者提出了首个大规模基准数据集FakePartsBench，包含2.5万+视频，并证明这种技术使人类和现有检测模型的准确率下降30%以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度伪造检测主要针对完全合成的内容，但现实中存在大量局部修改的部分伪造视频，这些内容更难检测且更具欺骗性，现有检测方法对此存在严重漏洞。

Method: 提出了FakeParts部分深度伪造技术，创建了FakePartsBench基准数据集（包含超过25,000个视频，带有像素级和帧级操作标注），并通过用户研究和现有检测模型评估其欺骗性。

Result: FakeParts部分伪造视频使人类检测准确率相比传统深度伪造下降超过30%，现有最先进检测模型也出现类似的性能下降，证明了当前检测方法的严重脆弱性。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了当前深度伪造检测方法对部分视频操作的严重漏洞，提供了必要的基准资源来开发更鲁棒的检测方法，以应对这种新型欺骗性更强的深度伪造威胁。

Abstract: We introduce FakeParts, a new class of deepfakes characterized by subtle,
localized manipulations to specific spatial regions or temporal segments of
otherwise authentic videos. Unlike fully synthetic content, these partial
manipulations, ranging from altered facial expressions to object substitutions
and background modifications, blend seamlessly with real elements, making them
particularly deceptive and difficult to detect. To address the critical gap in
detection capabilities, we present FakePartsBench, the first large-scale
benchmark dataset specifically designed to capture the full spectrum of partial
deepfakes. Comprising over 25K videos with pixel-level and frame-level
manipulation annotations, our dataset enables comprehensive evaluation of
detection methods. Our user studies demonstrate that FakeParts reduces human
detection accuracy by over 30% compared to traditional deepfakes, with similar
performance degradation observed in state-of-the-art detection models. This
work identifies an urgent vulnerability in current deepfake detection
approaches and provides the necessary resources to develop more robust methods
for partial video manipulations.

Motivation: 现有单目踪踪器遇到深度歧义和遮挡问题，而传统多摄像头方法需要过20+摄像头和每序列优化，实用性低

Method: 使用已知摄像机姿势和多视图深度信息，将多视图特征融合成统一点云，采用k近邻相关性和转换器类更新机制来预测3D对应关系

Result: 在Panoptic Studio和DexYCB两个真实数据集上达到中位轨迹误差分别为3.1cm和2.0cm，支持1-8个摄像头和24-150帧的视频长度

Conclusion: 该方法为多视图3D踪踪研究设置了新标准，提供了实用的实际应用工具，并开源了踪踪器和数据集

Abstract: We introduce the first data-driven multi-view 3D point tracker, designed to
track arbitrary points in dynamic scenes using multiple camera views. Unlike
existing monocular trackers, which struggle with depth ambiguities and
occlusion, or prior multi-camera methods that require over 20 cameras and
tedious per-sequence optimization, our feed-forward model directly predicts 3D
correspondences using a practical number of cameras (e.g., four), enabling
robust and accurate online tracking. Given known camera poses and either
sensor-based or estimated multi-view depth, our tracker fuses multi-view
features into a unified point cloud and applies k-nearest-neighbors correlation
alongside a transformer-based update to reliably estimate long-range 3D
correspondences, even under occlusion. We train on 5K synthetic multi-view
Kubric sequences and evaluate on two real-world benchmarks: Panoptic Studio and
DexYCB, achieving median trajectory errors of 3.1 cm and 2.0 cm, respectively.
Our method generalizes well to diverse camera setups of 1-8 views with varying
vantage points and video lengths of 24-150 frames. By releasing our tracker
alongside training and evaluation datasets, we aim to set a new standard for
multi-view 3D tracking research and provide a practical tool for real-world
applications. Project page available at https://ethz-vlg.github.io/mvtracker.

TL;DR: OneReward是一个统一的强化学习框架，使用单一奖励模型提升多任务生成能力，应用于掩码引导图像生成任务，在多个评估维度上超越商业和开源竞品。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多任务生成方法通常依赖任务特定的监督微调(SFT)，这限制了模型的泛化能力和训练效率。不同任务虽然共享相同的条件范式，但在数据分布和评估指标上差异显著，需要统一的解决方案。

Method: 提出OneReward框架，使用单一视觉语言模型(VLM)作为生成奖励模型，能够区分给定任务和评估标准下的优劣结果。基于此开发Seedream 3.0 Fill模型，通过多任务强化学习直接在预训练基础模型上训练，无需任务特定的SFT。

Result: 实验结果表明，统一的编辑模型在多个评估维度上一致优于商业和开源竞争对手，包括Ideogram、Adobe Photoshop和FLUX Fill [Pro]。

Conclusion: OneReward框架证明了使用单一奖励模型可以有效提升多任务生成能力，为多任务生成模型提供了一种高效统一的训练方法，消除了对任务特定监督微调的依赖。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce OneReward, a unified reinforcement learning
framework that enhances the model's generative capabilities across multiple
tasks under different evaluation criteria using only \textit{One Reward} model.
By employing a single vision-language model (VLM) as the generative reward
model, which can distinguish the winner and loser for a given task and a given
evaluation criterion, it can be effectively applied to multi-task generation
models, particularly in contexts with varied data and diverse task objectives.
We utilize OneReward for mask-guided image generation, which can be further
divided into several sub-tasks such as image fill, image extend, object
removal, and text rendering, involving a binary mask as the edit area. Although
these domain-specific tasks share same conditioning paradigm, they differ
significantly in underlying data distributions and evaluation metrics. Existing
methods often rely on task-specific supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which limits
generalization and training efficiency. Building on OneReward, we develop
Seedream 3.0 Fill, a mask-guided generation model trained via multi-task
reinforcement learning directly on a pre-trained base model, eliminating the
need for task-specific SFT. Experimental results demonstrate that our unified
edit model consistently outperforms both commercial and open-source
competitors, such as Ideogram, Adobe Photoshop, and FLUX Fill [Pro], across
multiple evaluation dimensions. Code and model are available at:

Conclusion: Dress&Dance提供了一个高质量且灵活的虚拟试穿体验，通过创新的CondNet架构和多模态训练策略，显著提升了虚拟试穿视频的生成质量。

Abstract: We present Dress&Dance, a video diffusion framework that generates high
quality 5-second-long 24 FPS virtual try-on videos at 1152x720 resolution of a
user wearing desired garments while moving in accordance with a given reference
video. Our approach requires a single user image and supports a range of tops,
bottoms, and one-piece garments, as well as simultaneous tops and bottoms
try-on in a single pass. Key to our framework is CondNet, a novel conditioning
network that leverages attention to unify multi-modal inputs (text, images, and
videos), thereby enhancing garment registration and motion fidelity. CondNet is
trained on heterogeneous training data, combining limited video data and a
larger, more readily available image dataset, in a multistage progressive
manner. Dress&Dance outperforms existing open source and commercial solutions

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了针对NeurIPS 2024擦除不可见挑战的获胜解决方案，展示了在黑白盒和米色盒攻击场景下近乎完美的水印去除效果（95.7%），同时保持图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数字水印技术的鲁棒性在面对对抗攻击时存在不确定性，需要通过系统性的攻击测试来验证和改进水印方法的抗攻击能力。

Method: 针对米色盒攻击使用基于VAE的自适应规避攻击，结合测试时优化和CIELAB空间的颜色对比度恢复；针对黑盒攻击采用基于空间或频域伪影的图像聚类，然后应用图像到图像扩散模型，结合受控噪声注入和ChatGPT生成的语义先验。

Result: 方法成功实现了近乎完美的水印去除率（95.7%），同时对剩余图像质量的影响可以忽略不计。

Conclusion: 这些攻击方法有望激发开发更鲁棒的图像水印技术，推动数字媒体认证和版权保护技术的发展。

Abstract: Content watermarking is an important tool for the authentication and
copyright protection of digital media. However, it is unclear whether existing
watermarks are robust against adversarial attacks. We present the winning
solution to the NeurIPS 2024 Erasing the Invisible challenge, which
stress-tests watermark robustness under varying degrees of adversary knowledge.
The challenge consisted of two tracks: a black-box and beige-box track,
depending on whether the adversary knows which watermarking method was used by
the provider. For the beige-box track, we leverage an adaptive VAE-based
evasion attack, with a test-time optimization and color-contrast restoration in
CIELAB space to preserve the image's quality. For the black-box track, we first
cluster images based on their artifacts in the spatial or frequency-domain.
Then, we apply image-to-image diffusion models with controlled noise injection
and semantic priors from ChatGPT-generated captions to each cluster with
optimized parameter settings. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method
successfully achieves near-perfect watermark removal (95.7%) with negligible
impact on the residual image's quality. We hope that our attacks inspire the
development of more robust image watermarking methods.

TL;DR: 通过3D CNN网络结合专门的偏差罚正方法，实现了肺结节体积的高精度自动估算，误差从传统方法的25-30%降至8.0%，处理速度提升3倍以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的肺结节体积估算方法（如CTR比和球形近似）因结节形状和密度的变性导致估计不一致，影响早期肺癌检测的准确性。

Method: 提出了一种结合多尺度3D卷积神经网络(CNN)和子型特异性偏差罚正的先进框架，进行精确的体积估算。模型基于上海胸科医院的364例数据进行训练和评估。

Result: 方法实现了较手动非线性回归的8.0%平均绝对偏差，每次扫描推理时间不超20秒。这一结果远超现有深度学习和半自动流程（误差25-30%，处理时间超60秒），锐减误差超17个百分点，处理速度提升3倍。

Conclusion: 该方法为临床肺结节筛查和监测提供了高准确、高效率且可扩展的工具，在提高早期肺癌检测方面具有广阔的应用前景。

Abstract: Early detection of lung cancer is crucial for effective treatment and relies
on accurate volumetric assessment of pulmonary nodules in CT scans. Traditional
methods, such as consolidation-to-tumor ratio (CTR) and spherical
approximation, are limited by inconsistent estimates due to variability in
nodule shape and density. We propose an advanced framework that combines a
multi-scale 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) with subtype-specific bias
correction for precise volume estimation. The model was trained and evaluated
on a dataset of 364 cases from Shanghai Chest Hospital. Our approach achieved a
mean absolute deviation of 8.0 percent compared to manual nonlinear regression,
with inference times under 20 seconds per scan. This method outperforms
existing deep learning and semi-automated pipelines, which typically have
errors of 25 to 30 percent and require over 60 seconds for processing. Our
results show a reduction in error by over 17 percentage points and a threefold
acceleration in processing speed. These advancements offer a highly accurate,
efficient, and scalable tool for clinical lung nodule screening and monitoring,
with promising potential for improving early lung cancer detection.

Method: 采用两阶段训练框架：1）在多源公共城市数据集和小规模域内数据集上预训练投影式CNN；2）仅使用域内数据微调轻量级预测头。应用Point Prompt Training到批归一化层，使用Manifold Mixup作为正则化器，并引入直方图归一化环境特征。

Result: 仅使用50个标注点云，mIoU从33.5%提升至51.8%，整体准确率从85.5%提升至90.8%，显著优于直接在域内数据上的朴素训练方法。

Conclusion: 跨多个数据集预训练是提高泛化能力和在有限监督下实现鲁棒分割的关键，该研究为挑战性低数据场景下的3D语义分割提供了实用框架。

Abstract: In this case study, we present a data-efficient point cloud segmentation
pipeline and training framework for robust segmentation of unimproved roads and
seven other classes. Our method employs a two-stage training framework: first,
a projection-based convolutional neural network is pre-trained on a mixture of
public urban datasets and a small, curated in-domain dataset; then, a
lightweight prediction head is fine-tuned exclusively on in-domain data. Along
the way, we explore the application of Point Prompt Training to batch
normalization layers and the effects of Manifold Mixup as a regularizer within
our pipeline. We also explore the effects of incorporating histogram-normalized
ambients to further boost performance. Using only 50 labeled point clouds from
our target domain, we show that our proposed training approach improves mean
Intersection-over-Union from 33.5% to 51.8% and the overall accuracy from 85.5%
to 90.8%, when compared to naive training on the in-domain data. Crucially, our
results demonstrate that pre-training across multiple datasets is key to
improving generalization and enabling robust segmentation under limited
in-domain supervision. Overall, this study demonstrates a practical framework
for robust 3D semantic segmentation in challenging, low-data scenarios. Our
code is available at: https://github.com/andrewyarovoi/MD-FRNet.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态场景插值方法假设相邻时间步之间的运动足够小，但实践中即使轻微偏离这个假设也会导致传统技术失败，需要能够处理大运动的方法

Method: 提出全局运动对应器(GMC)，学习一元势场预测SE(3)映射到共享规范空间，平衡对应关系、空间和语义平滑性以及局部刚性

Result: 在经历大全局运动的3D场景插值任务中显著优于现有基线方法，并具备其他基线方法无法实现的外推能力

Conclusion: GMC方法能够鲁棒地处理大运动并实现平滑过渡，为动态场景插值提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Existing dynamic scene interpolation methods typically assume that the motion
between consecutive timesteps is small enough so that displacements can be
locally approximated by linear models. In practice, even slight deviations from
this small-motion assumption can cause conventional techniques to fail. In this
paper, we introduce Global Motion Corresponder (GMC), a novel approach that
robustly handles large motion and achieves smooth transitions. GMC learns unary
potential fields that predict SE(3) mappings into a shared canonical space,
balancing correspondence, spatial and semantic smoothness, and local rigidity.
We demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines on
3D scene interpolation when the two states undergo large global motions.
Furthermore, our method enables extrapolation capabilities where other baseline
methods cannot.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation has advanced rapidly over the past two decades,
largely driven by deep learning, which has enabled accurate and efficient
delineation of cells, tissues, organs, and pathologies across diverse imaging
modalities. This progress raises a fundamental question: to what extent have
current models overcome persistent challenges, and what gaps remain? In this
work, we provide an in-depth review of medical image segmentation, tracing its
progress and key developments over the past decade. We examine core principles,
including multiscale analysis, attention mechanisms, and the integration of
prior knowledge, across the encoder, bottleneck, skip connections, and decoder
components of segmentation networks. Our discussion is organized around seven
key dimensions: (1) the shift from supervised to semi-/unsupervised learning,
(2) the transition from organ segmentation to lesion-focused tasks, (3)
advances in multi-modality integration and domain adaptation, (4) the role of
foundation models and transfer learning, (5) the move from deterministic to
probabilistic segmentation, (6) the progression from 2D to 3D and 4D
segmentation, and (7) the trend from model invocation to segmentation agents.
Together, these perspectives provide a holistic overview of the trajectory of
deep learning-based medical image segmentation and aim to inspire future
innovation. To support ongoing research, we maintain a continually updated

TL;DR: 利用iPhone 15 Pro Max的LiDAR技术实现实时背景移除，替代传统绿幕和AI方法，在60fps下运行，但受限于深度图分辨率(320x240)和材料反射特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统背景移除技术如绿幕抠像和AI模型受光照条件限制，LiDAR的深度信息不受光照影响，能在各种光线环境下稳定工作。

Method: 集成iPhone 15 Pro Max的LiDAR和彩色摄像头，使用SwiftUI和Swift框架开发用户界面和后端，Metal Shader Language实现实时图像增强，达到60fps帧率。

Result: 成功实现基于LiDAR的实时背景移除系统，性能稳定，但深度图分辨率较低(320x240)，且某些材料可能影响LiDAR深度测量精度。

Conclusion: 如果移动设备LiDAR分辨率能提升到与彩色图像匹配，LiDAR有望成为视频和摄影应用中背景移除的主流技术。

Abstract: Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology in consumer-grade mobile
devices can be used as a replacement for traditional background removal and
compositing techniques. Unlike approaches such as chroma keying and trained AI
models, LiDAR's depth information is independent of subject lighting, and
performs equally well in low-light and well-lit environments. We integrate the
LiDAR and color cameras on the iPhone 15 Pro Max with GPU-based image
processing. We use Apple's SwiftUI and Swift frameworks for user interface and
backend development, and Metal Shader Language (MSL) for realtime image
enhancement at the standard iPhone streaming frame rate of 60 frames per
second. The only meaningful limitations of the technology are the streaming
bandwidth of the depth data, which currently reduces the depth map resolution
to 320x240, and any pre-existing limitations of the LiDAR IR laser to reflect
accurate depth from some materials. If the LiDAR resolution on a mobile device
like the iPhone can be improved to match the color image resolution, LiDAR
could feasibly become the preeminent method of background removal for video
applications and photography.

TL;DR: GENRE-CMR是一种基于GAN的生成对抗网络架构，采用残差深度展开重建框架，通过边缘感知区域损失和统计分布对齐损失来提升心脏磁共振图像重建的保真度和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决加速心脏磁共振成像中扫描时间与图像质量之间的权衡问题，特别是在不同采集设置下的泛化能力挑战。

Method: 使用生成对抗网络(GAN)架构，结合残差深度展开重建框架，集成边缘感知区域(EAR)损失和统计分布对齐(SDA)损失来指导网络学习。

Result: 在未见数据上达到0.9552 SSIM和38.90 dB PSNR，超越了现有最先进方法，在各种加速因子和采样轨迹上表现优异。

Conclusion: 该框架为高质量心脏磁共振重建提供了统一且稳健的解决方案，为临床异构采集协议的适应性部署铺平了道路。

Abstract: Accelerated Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (CMR) image reconstruction
remains a critical challenge due to the trade-off between scan time and image
quality, particularly when generalizing across diverse acquisition settings. We
propose GENRE-CMR, a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based architecture
employing a residual deep unrolled reconstruction framework to enhance
reconstruction fidelity and generalization. The architecture unrolls iterative
optimization into a cascade of convolutional subnetworks, enriched with
residual connections to enable progressive feature propagation from shallow to
deeper stages. To further improve performance, we integrate two loss functions:
(1) an Edge-Aware Region (EAR) loss, which guides the network to focus on
structurally informative regions and helps prevent common reconstruction
blurriness; and (2) a Statistical Distribution Alignment (SDA) loss, which
regularizes the feature space across diverse data distributions via a symmetric
KL divergence formulation. Extensive experiments confirm that GENRE-CMR
surpasses state-of-the-art methods on training and unseen data, achieving
0.9552 SSIM and 38.90 dB PSNR on unseen distributions across various
acceleration factors and sampling trajectories. Ablation studies confirm the
contribution of each proposed component to reconstruction quality and
generalization. Our framework presents a unified and robust solution for
high-quality CMR reconstruction, paving the way for clinically adaptable
deployment across heterogeneous acquisition protocols.

TL;DR: DINOv3-H+视觉变换器通过LoRA微调和数据增强，在MIDOG 2025挑战中实现了0.8871的平衡准确率，为异型有丝分裂分类提供了强基线


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异型有丝分裂(AMF)是预后不良的标志物，但由于低患病率、形态学细微差异和观察者间变异性，检测仍然困难

Method: 使用在自然图像上预训练的DINOv3-H+视觉变换器，通过低秩适应(LoRA, 65万可训练参数)和广泛的数据增强进行微调

Result: 尽管存在领域差距，DINOv3在组织病理学上有效迁移，在初步测试集上达到0.8871的平衡准确率

Conclusion: DINOv3预训练具有强大鲁棒性，结合参数高效微调，为MIDOG 2025中的异型有丝分裂分类提供了强有力的基线方法

Abstract: Atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) are markers of abnormal cell division
associated with poor prognosis, yet their detection remains difficult due to
low prevalence, subtle morphology, and inter-observer variability. The MIDOG
2025 challenge introduces a benchmark for AMF classification across multiple
domains. In this work, we evaluate the recently published DINOv3-H+ vision
transformer, pretrained on natural images, which we fine-tuned using low-rank
adaptation (LoRA, 650k trainable parameters) and extensive augmentation.
Despite the domain gap, DINOv3 transfers effectively to histopathology,
achieving a balanced accuracy of 0.8871 on the preliminary test set. These
results highlight the robustness of DINOv3 pretraining and show that, when
combined with parameter-efficient fine-tuning, it provides a strong baseline
for atypical mitosis classification in MIDOG 2025.

TL;DR: 提出Mixture of Contexts (MoC)稀疏注意力路由模块，通过动态选择信息块和强制锚点来解决长视频生成中的长上下文记忆问题，实现近线性计算扩展和分钟级一致性生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频生成本质上是长上下文记忆问题，需要模型在长范围内保持和检索重要事件。传统扩散变换器的二次自注意力成本使得内存和计算在长序列上难以处理。

Method: 将长上下文视频生成重新定义为内部信息检索任务，提出可学习的稀疏注意力路由模块MoC。每个查询动态选择少量信息块和强制锚点（标题、局部窗口）进行注意力计算，采用因果路由防止循环闭合。

Result: 通过扩展数据和逐步稀疏化路由，模型将计算资源分配给重要历史信息，在分钟级内容中保持身份、动作和场景的一致性，实现近线性计算扩展。

Conclusion: MoC模块作为有效的长期记忆检索引擎，使模型能够在分钟尺度上出现记忆和一致性，同时效率作为检索的副产品，实现了实用的训练和合成。

Abstract: Long video generation is fundamentally a long context memory problem: models
must retain and retrieve salient events across a long range without collapsing
or drifting. However, scaling diffusion transformers to generate long-context
videos is fundamentally limited by the quadratic cost of self-attention, which
makes memory and computation intractable and difficult to optimize for long
sequences. We recast long-context video generation as an internal information
retrieval task and propose a simple, learnable sparse attention routing module,
Mixture of Contexts (MoC), as an effective long-term memory retrieval engine.
In MoC, each query dynamically selects a few informative chunks plus mandatory
anchors (caption, local windows) to attend to, with causal routing that
prevents loop closures. As we scale the data and gradually sparsify the
routing, the model allocates compute to salient history, preserving identities,
actions, and scenes over minutes of content. Efficiency follows as a byproduct
of retrieval (near-linear scaling), which enables practical training and
synthesis, and the emergence of memory and consistency at the scale of minutes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地震体波研究中的关键挑战是低振幅P波和S波经常被时频重叠的面波掩盖，传统滤波方法效果有限，需要先进的信号处理技术

Method: 开发SP-TFF方法，利用预测的地震射线入射角构建方向性滤波器，在时频域集成振幅、方向性和线性度信息，专门设计滤波器组来分离体波能量

Result: 在合成测试和2021年墨西哥格雷罗Mw 7.0地震波形数据上验证，SP-TFF为自动体波提取提供了稳健的计算框架

Conclusion: SP-TFF成功实现了将偏振信息滤波集成到地震数据处理流程中，能够有效提取被高振幅面波掩盖的体波信号

Abstract: Seismic waves generated by earthquakes consist of multiple phases that carry
critical information about Earth's internal structure as they propagate through
heterogeneous media. These phases provide constraints from different regions of
the Earth, such as the crust, mantle, and even the cores. The choice of phase
depends on the study target and scientific objective: surface waves are suited
for imaging shallow structures, whereas body waves yield higher-resolution
information at depth. A key challenge in body-wave studies is that the
low-amplitude P and S arrivals are often masked by surface waves overlapping in
both time and frequency. Although body waves typically contain higher-frequency
content, their spectral overlap with surface waves limits the effectiveness of
conventional filtering approaches. Addressing this issue requires advanced
signal-processing techniques. One such method, Sparsity-Promoting
Time-Frequency Filtering (SP-TFF, Mohammadigheymasi et al., 2022), exploits
high-resolution polarization information in the time-frequency domain. SP-TFF
integrates amplitude, directivity, and rectilinearity to enhance phase
discrimination. Here, we further develop SP-TFF by designing a filter set
tailored to isolate body-wave arrivals otherwise masked by high-amplitude
surface waves. The directivity filters are constructed from predicted seismic
ray incidence angles, enabling focused extraction of body-wave energy and
suppression of interfering phases. We evaluate the method on both synthetic
tests and waveform data from the Mw 7.0 Guerrero, Mexico, earthquake of
September 8, 2021, recorded by the United States National Seismic Network
(USNSN). Our results show that SP-TFF provides a robust computational framework
for automated body-wave extraction, integrating polarization-informed filtering
into seismological data-processing pipelines.

Motivation: 转移是头颌鱼相细胞瘤临床管理的主要挑战，需要可靠的治疗前预测来优化治疗策略和预后

Method: 使用3D Swin Transformer从肿瘤区域提取深度特征，结合收入形态学特征和临床数据，通过全连接网络进行多模态融合预测

Result: 融合模型表现最佳（AUC=0.803，准确度=0.752），显著超过单一模态模型，具有良好的可突性和可解释性

Conclusion: 该多模态融合模型能够准确预测HNSCC转移风险，为个性化治疗规划提供了可能的临床决策支持工具

Abstract: Metastasis remains the major challenge in the clinical management of head and
neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Reliable pre-treatment prediction of
metastatic risk is crucial for optimizing treatment strategies and prognosis.
This study develops a deep learning-based multimodal framework to predict
metastasis risk in HNSCC patients by integrating computed tomography (CT)
images, radiomics, and clinical data. 1497 HNSCC patients were included. Tumor
and organ masks were derived from pretreatment CT images. A 3D Swin Transformer
extracted deep features from tumor regions. Meanwhile, 1562 radiomics features
were obtained using PyRadiomics, followed by correlation filtering and random
forest selection, leaving 36 features. Clinical variables including age, sex,
smoking, and alcohol status were encoded and fused with imaging-derived
features. Multimodal features were fed into a fully connected network to
predict metastasis risk. Performance was evaluated using five-fold
cross-validation with area under the curve (AUC), accuracy (ACC), sensitivity
(SEN), and specificity (SPE). The proposed fusion model outperformed
single-modality models. The 3D deep learning module alone achieved an AUC of
0.715, and when combined with radiomics and clinical features, predictive
performance improved (AUC = 0.803, ACC = 0.752, SEN = 0.730, SPE = 0.758).
Stratified analysis showed generalizability across tumor subtypes. Ablation
studies indicated complementary information from different modalities.
Evaluation showed the 3D Swin Transformer provided more robust representation
learning than conventional networks. This multimodal fusion model demonstrated
high accuracy and robustness in predicting metastasis risk in HNSCC, offering a
comprehensive representation of tumor biology. The interpretable model has
potential as a clinical decision-support tool for personalized treatment
planning.

Abstract: Real-time human-device interaction in industrial Metaverse faces challenges
such as high computational load, limited bandwidth, and strict latency. This
paper proposes a task-oriented edge-assisted cross-system framework using
digital twins (DTs) to enable responsive interactions. By predicting operator
motions, the system supports: 1) proactive Metaverse rendering for visual
feedback, and 2) preemptive control of remote devices. The DTs are decoupled
into two virtual functions-visual display and robotic control-optimizing both
performance and adaptability. To enhance generalizability, we introduce the
Human-In-The-Loop Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (HITL-MAML) algorithm, which
dynamically adjusts prediction horizons. Evaluation on two tasks demonstrates
the framework's effectiveness: in a Trajectory-Based Drawing Control task, it
reduces weighted RMSE from 0.0712 m to 0.0101 m; in a real-time 3D scene
representation task for nuclear decommissioning, it achieves a PSNR of 22.11,
SSIM of 0.8729, and LPIPS of 0.1298. These results show the framework's

Conclusion: SPGrasp有效解决了动态抓取合成中的延迟-交互性权衡问题，实现了实时交互式抓取。

Abstract: Real-time interactive grasp synthesis for dynamic objects remains challenging
as existing methods fail to achieve low-latency inference while maintaining
promptability. To bridge this gap, we propose SPGrasp (spatiotemporal
prompt-driven dynamic grasp synthesis), a novel framework extending segment
anything model v2 (SAMv2) for video stream grasp estimation. Our core
innovation integrates user prompts with spatiotemporal context, enabling
real-time interaction with end-to-end latency as low as 59 ms while ensuring
temporal consistency for dynamic objects. In benchmark evaluations, SPGrasp
achieves instance-level grasp accuracies of 90.6% on OCID and 93.8% on
Jacquard. On the challenging GraspNet-1Billion dataset under continuous
tracking, SPGrasp achieves 92.0% accuracy with 73.1 ms per-frame latency,
representing a 58.5% reduction compared to the prior state-of-the-art
promptable method RoG-SAM while maintaining competitive accuracy. Real-world
experiments involving 13 moving objects demonstrate a 94.8% success rate in

Result: 在单视角选择和完整轨迹规划任务上达到state-of-the-art性能，能够有效提升定位鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ActLoc的模块化设计使其适用于各种机器人导航和检测任务，通过主动视角选择显著提高了定位可靠性。

Abstract: Reliable localization is critical for robot navigation, yet most existing
systems implicitly assume that all viewing directions at a location are equally
informative. In practice, localization becomes unreliable when the robot
observes unmapped, ambiguous, or uninformative regions. To address this, we
present ActLoc, an active viewpoint-aware planning framework for enhancing
localization accuracy for general robot navigation tasks. At its core, ActLoc
employs a largescale trained attention-based model for viewpoint selection. The
model encodes a metric map and the camera poses used during map construction,
and predicts localization accuracy across yaw and pitch directions at arbitrary
3D locations. These per-point accuracy distributions are incorporated into a
path planner, enabling the robot to actively select camera orientations that
maximize localization robustness while respecting task and motion constraints.
ActLoc achieves stateof-the-art results on single-viewpoint selection and
generalizes effectively to fulltrajectory planning. Its modular design makes it
readily applicable to diverse robot navigation and inspection tasks.

Abstract: Recent scientific studies have suggested that, in certain physical
configurations, the time-dependent behavior of earthquake rupture and seafloor
(bathymetry) motion can leave observable near-field signatures in tsunami wave
generation and propagation. However, dynamic ground movement is often neglected
in conventional tsunami models, which commonly assume instantaneous ground
displacement (sourcing). This work introduces a pseudo-spectral algorithm for
the solution of the nonlinear shallow water equations with timedependent
seafloor displacement and velocity. Based on a Fourier continuation (FC)
methodology for the accurate trigonometric interpolation of a non-periodic
function, the solver provides high-order convergence in space and time; mild
(linear) Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) constraints for explicit time
integration; and results that are effectively free of numerical dispersion (or
''pollution'') errors. Such properties enable the efficient and robust
resolution of the different space-time scales involved modeling tsunamis
generated by dynamic earthquake ground motion (including over long distances).
Numerical experiments attesting to accuracy and computational performance are
presented with direct comparisons to high-order finite difference
methodologies. The solver is physically validated by a number of classical and
semi-classical benchmark cases based on simulated or experimental data.
Additionally, a seismologically realistic, first-of-its-kind parametric study
based on earthquake speed is introduced, whose results-easily facilitated by
the FC-based approach proposed herein, with minimal numerical tuning-further
demonstrate the potential importance of (and the motivation herein for)
incorporating time-dependent seafloor behavior in quantitative tsunami hazard
assessment.

Abstract: We present LoTUS, a novel Machine Unlearning (MU) method that eliminates the
influence of training samples from pre-trained models, avoiding retraining from

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) has emerged as an effective model compression
technique in deep learning, enabling the transfer of knowledge from a large
teacher model to a compact student model. While KD has demonstrated significant
success, it is not yet fully understood which factors contribute to improving
the student's performance. In this paper, we reveal a strong correlation
between the teacher's calibration error and the student's accuracy. Therefore,
we claim that the calibration of the teacher model is an important factor for
effective KD. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the performance of KD can be
improved by simply employing a calibration method that reduces the teacher's
calibration error. Our algorithm is versatile, demonstrating effectiveness
across various tasks from classification to detection. Moreover, it can be
easily integrated with existing state-of-the-art methods, consistently
achieving superior performance.

Motivation: 超声信号在工业无损检测中至关重要，但标注数据稀缺且信号处理任务特定。MAE在视觉领域成功但1D信号分析尚未充分探索，需要开发适用于超声信号的自监督学习方法。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了MAE通过可扩展的自监督学习推动超声信号分析的潜力，为工业应用中的信号处理提供了有效的预训练方法。

Abstract: We investigated the adaptation and performance of Masked Autoencoders (MAEs)
with Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures for self-supervised representation
learning on one-dimensional (1D) ultrasound signals. Although MAEs have
demonstrated significant success in computer vision and other domains, their
use for 1D signal analysis, especially for raw ultrasound data, remains largely
unexplored. Ultrasound signals are vital in industrial applications such as
non-destructive testing (NDT) and structural health monitoring (SHM), where
labeled data are often scarce and signal processing is highly task-specific. We
propose an approach that leverages MAE to pre-train on unlabeled synthetic
ultrasound signals, enabling the model to learn robust representations that
enhance performance in downstream tasks, such as time-of-flight (ToF)
classification. This study systematically investigated the impact of model
size, patch size, and masking ratio on pre-training efficiency and downstream
accuracy. Our results show that pre-trained models significantly outperform
models trained from scratch and strong convolutional neural network (CNN)
baselines optimized for the downstream task. Additionally, pre-training on
synthetic data demonstrates superior transferability to real-world measured
signals compared with training solely on limited real datasets. This study
underscores the potential of MAEs for advancing ultrasound signal analysis
through scalable, self-supervised learning.

Abstract: We introduce SAFEMax, a novel method for Machine Unlearning in diffusion
models. Grounded in information-theoretic principles, SAFEMax maximizes the
entropy in generated images, causing the model to generate Gaussian noise when
conditioned on impermissible classes by ultimately halting its denoising
process. Also, our method controls the balance between forgetting and retention
by selectively focusing on the early diffusion steps, where class-specific
information is prominent. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of SAFEMax
and highlight its substantial efficiency gains over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated considerable potential in the
realm of medical imaging. However, the development of high-performance AI
models typically necessitates training on large-scale, centralized datasets.
This approach is confronted with significant challenges due to strict patient
privacy regulations and legal restrictions on data sharing and utilization.
These limitations hinder the development of large-scale models in medical
domains and impede continuous updates and training with new data. Federated
Learning (FL), a privacy-preserving distributed training framework, offers a
new solution by enabling collaborative model development across fragmented
medical datasets. In this survey, we review FL's contributions at two stages of
the full-stack medical analysis pipeline. First, in upstream tasks such as CT
or MRI reconstruction, FL enables joint training of robust reconstruction
networks on diverse, multi-institutional datasets, alleviating data scarcity
while preserving confidentiality. Second, in downstream clinical tasks like
tumor diagnosis and segmentation, FL supports continuous model updating by
allowing local fine-tuning on new data without centralizing sensitive images.
We comprehensively analyze FL implementations across the medical imaging
pipeline, from physics-informed reconstruction networks to diagnostic AI
systems, highlighting innovations that improve communication efficiency, align
heterogeneous data, and ensure secure parameter aggregation. Meanwhile, this
paper provides an outlook on future research directions, aiming to serve as a
valuable reference for the field's development.

TL;DR: GUARD是一种测试方法，将政府发布的AI伦理指南转化为具体的违规测试问题，通过自动生成违反指南的问题来评估LLM的合规性，并包含越狱诊断功能来识别绕过安全机制的场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在各领域的广泛应用，其生成有害内容的风险引发社会关注。政府发布的伦理指南多为高层要求，缺乏可操作的测试方法，需要将指南转化为具体的测试问题来验证LLM合规性。

Method: GUARD方法自动生成基于政府指南的违规问题来测试LLM响应。对于不直接违规的响应，GUARD-JD集成越狱诊断概念，创建场景诱导不道德或违规响应，识别可能绕过安全机制的情况。最终生成合规报告。

Result: 在7个LLM（包括Vicuna-13B、LongChat-7B、Llama2-7B、Llama-3-8B、GPT-3.5、GPT-4、GPT-4o和Claude-3.7）上实证验证了有效性，测试了三个政府指南的合规性并进行了越狱诊断。GUARD-JD还可迁移到视觉语言模型。

Conclusion: GUARD提供了一种将高层伦理指南转化为具体测试问题的方法，有效评估LLM合规性并识别安全漏洞，有助于促进可靠的LLM应用发展。

Abstract: As Large Language Models become increasingly integral to various domains,
their potential to generate harmful responses has prompted significant societal
and regulatory concerns. In response, governments have issued ethics guidelines
to promote the development of trustworthy AI. However, these guidelines are
typically high-level demands for developers and testers, leaving a gap in
translating them into actionable testing questions to verify LLM compliance.
  To address this challenge, we introduce GUARD (\textbf{G}uideline
\textbf{U}pholding Test through \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{R}ole-play and
Jailbreak \textbf{D}iagnostics), a testing method designed to operationalize
guidelines into specific guideline-violating questions that assess LLM
adherence. To implement this, GUARD uses automated generation of
guideline-violating questions based on government-issued guidelines, thereby
testing whether responses comply with these guidelines. When responses directly
violate guidelines, GUARD reports inconsistencies. Furthermore, for responses
that do not directly violate guidelines, GUARD integrates the concept of
``jailbreaks'' to diagnostics, named GUARD-JD, which creates scenarios that
provoke unethical or guideline-violating responses, effectively identifying
potential scenarios that could bypass built-in safety mechanisms. Our method
finally culminates in a compliance report, delineating the extent of adherence
and highlighting any violations.
  We have empirically validated the effectiveness of GUARD on seven LLMs,
including Vicuna-13B, LongChat-7B, Llama2-7B, Llama-3-8B, GPT-3.5, GPT-4,
GPT-4o, and Claude-3.7, by testing compliance under three government-issued
guidelines and conducting jailbreak diagnostics. Additionally, GUARD-JD can
transfer jailbreak diagnostics to vision-language models, demonstrating its
usage in promoting reliable LLM-based applications.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了脉冲神经网络中泄漏时间常数(LTC)对不同数据类型分类性能的影响，发现最优LTC范围对准确率、权重分布和能量效率至关重要，需要根据任务特性进行特定调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脉冲神经网络在低功耗边缘计算中具有潜力，但泄漏时间常数这一关键参数对不同数据模态的影响尚未充分研究，需要系统分析其对网络性能的影响。

Method: 使用时间自适应前馈脉冲神经网络，在静态图像、动态图像和生物信号时间序列分类任务上进行实验，分析不同LTC值对推理准确率、突触权重分布和发放动态的影响。

Result: 实验表明：静态和动态图像任务中，中等LTC值获得更高准确率和紧凑的权重分布；时间序列任务中，最优LTC增强时间特征保留并允许LTC变化容忍；准确率在特定LTC范围内达到峰值，超出该范围会显著下降。

Conclusion: 任务特定的LTC调谐对高效脉冲编码和鲁棒学习至关重要，研究结果为硬件感知的SNN优化提供了实用指南，有助于实现可扩展的超低功耗SNN部署。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are promising candidates for low-power edge
computing in domains such as wearable sensing and time-series analysis. A key
neuronal parameter, the leaky time constant (LTC), governs temporal integration
of information in Leaky Integrateand-Fire (LIF) neurons, yet its impact on
feedforward SNN performance across different data modalities remains
underexplored. This study investigates the role of LTC in a temporally adaptive
feedforward SNN applied to static image, dynamic image, and biosignal
time-series classification. Presented experiments demonstrate that LTCs
critically affect inference accuracy, synaptic weight distributions, and firing
dynamics. For static and dynamic images, intermediate LTCs yield higher
accuracy and compact, centered weight histograms, reflecting stable feature
encoding. In time-series tasks, optimal LTCs enhance temporal feature retention
and result in broader weight sparsity, allowing for tolerance of LTC
variations. The provided results show that inference accuracy peaks at specific
LTC ranges, with significant degradation beyond this optimal band due to
over-integration or excessive forgetting. Firing rate analysis reveals a strong
interplay between LTC, network depth, and energy efficiency, underscoring the
importance of balanced spiking activity. These findings reveal that
task-specific LTC tuning is essential for efficient spike coding and robust
learning. The results provide practical guidelines for hardware-aware SNN
optimization and highlight how neuronal time constants can be designed to match
task dynamics. This work contributes toward scalable, ultra-lowpower SNN
deployment for real-time classification tasks in neuromorphic computing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脉冲神经网络(SNN)作为节能且生物可信的深度学习替代方案，在高风险生物医学成像中的应用几乎未被探索，特别是在肝脏健康状态分类方面。

Method: 使用Medical Segmentation Decathlon的Task03\Liver数据集，比较三种学习算法（替代梯度学习、Tempotron规则、生物启发主动学习）和三种架构变体（定制低层模型、snnTorch和SpikingJelly框架），采用Optuna进行超参数优化。

Result: 定制构建的SNNDeep在验证准确率（98.35%）、学习规则适应性和训练效率方面均优于基于框架的实现。

Conclusion: 研究首次证明低层高度可调SNN在医学成像中能超越标准框架，特别是在数据有限、时间受限的诊断场景中，为精准医学中的神经启发AI开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Purpose: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have recently gained attention as
energy-efficient, biologically plausible alternatives to conventional deep
learning models. Their application in high-stakes biomedical imaging remains
almost entirely unexplored. Methods: This study introduces SNNDeep, the first
tailored SNN specifically optimized for binary classification of liver health
status from computed tomography (CT) features. To ensure clinical relevance and
broad generalizability, the model was developed and evaluated using the
Task03\Liver dataset from the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD), a
standardized benchmark widely used for assessing performance across diverse
medical imaging tasks. We benchmark three fundamentally different learning
algorithms, namely Surrogate Gradient Learning, the Tempotron rule, and
Bio-Inspired Active Learning across three architectural variants: a fully
customized low-level model built from scratch, and two implementations using
leading SNN frameworks, i.e., snnTorch and SpikingJelly. Hyperparameter
optimization was performed using Optuna. Results: Our results demonstrate that
the custom-built SNNDeep consistently outperforms framework-based
implementations, achieving a maximum validation accuracy of 98.35%, superior
adaptability across learning rules, and significantly reduced training
overhead. Conclusion:This study provides the first empirical evidence that
low-level, highly tunable SNNs can surpass standard frameworks in medical
imaging, especially in data-limited, temporally constrained diagnostic
settings, thereby opening a new pathway for neuro-inspired AI in precision
medicine.
