### [1] [CNVSRC 2024: The Second Chinese Continuous Visual Speech Recognition Challenge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02010)
*Zehua Liu,Xiaolou Li,Chen Chen,Lantian Li,Dong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CNVSRC 2024是中文连续视觉语音识别挑战赛的延续，改进了基线系统和数据集，推动了该领域的技术进步。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推动中文大词汇量连续视觉语音识别（LVC-VSR）的研究，通过挑战赛形式促进技术进步。

Method: 使用CN-CVS和CNVSRC-Single/Multi数据集，引入更强的基线系统和新增数据集CN-CVS2-P1。

Result: 展示了数据预处理、特征提取、模型设计和训练策略的创新，提升了中文LVC-VSR的技术水平。

Conclusion: CNVSRC 2024通过改进和新增数据集，进一步推动了中文LVC-VSR领域的发展。

Abstract: This paper presents the second Chinese Continuous Visual Speech Recognition
Challenge (CNVSRC 2024), which builds on CNVSRC 2023 to advance research in
Chinese Large Vocabulary Continuous Visual Speech Recognition (LVC-VSR). The
challenge evaluates two test scenarios: reading in recording studios and
Internet speech. CNVSRC 2024 uses the same datasets as its predecessor CNVSRC
2023, which involves CN-CVS for training and CNVSRC-Single/Multi for
development and evaluation. However, CNVSRC 2024 introduced two key
improvements: (1) a stronger baseline system, and (2) an additional dataset,
CN-CVS2-P1, for open tracks to improve data volume and diversity. The new
challenge has demonstrated several important innovations in data preprocessing,
feature extraction, model design, and training strategies, further pushing the
state-of-the-art in Chinese LVC-VSR. More details and resources are available
at the official website.

### [2] [OASIS: Online Sample Selection for Continual Visual Instruction Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02011)
*Minjae Lee,Minhyuk Seo,Tingyu Qu,Tinne Tuytelaars,Jonghyun Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OASIS是一种自适应在线样本选择方法，用于持续视觉指令调整（CVIT），动态调整每批样本数量以减少冗余并适应分布变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在CVIT场景中，大规模数据的训练延迟阻碍实时适应，现有方法依赖预训练参考模型或固定样本选择策略，无法应对未来数据和分布变化。

Method: 提出OASIS方法，动态调整每批样本数量，并通过迭代更新选择分数最小化冗余。

Result: 实验表明，OASIS仅用25%数据即可达到全数据训练的性能，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: OASIS有效解决了CVIT中的实时适应问题，显著提升了效率。

Abstract: In continual visual instruction tuning (CVIT) scenarios, where multi-modal
data continuously arrive in an online streaming manner, training delays from
large-scale data significantly hinder real-time adaptation. While existing data
selection strategies reduce training overheads, they rely on pre-trained
reference models, which are impractical in CVIT setups due to unknown future
data. Recent reference model-free online sample selection methods address this
issue but typically select a fixed number of samples per batch (e.g., top-k),
causing them to suffer from distribution shifts where informativeness varies
across batches. To address these limitations, we propose OASIS, an adaptive
online sample selection approach for CVIT that: (1) dynamically adjusts
selected samples per batch based on relative inter-batch informativeness, and
(2) minimizes redundancy of selected samples through iterative selection score
updates. Empirical results across various MLLMs, such as LLaVA-1.5 and
Qwen-VL-2.5, show that OASIS achieves comparable performance to full-data
training using only 25% of the data and outperforms the state-of-the-art.

*Zehua Liu,Xiaolou Li,Li Guo,Lantian Li,Dong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文探讨了如何利用大型语言模型（LLMs）提升视觉语音识别（VSR）性能，提出了三项关键贡献：规模测试、上下文感知解码和迭代优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在VSR系统中已显示出性能提升潜力，但其具体应用方式尚未深入研究。

Method: 通过规模测试研究LLM大小对VSR的影响，引入上下文感知解码和迭代优化方法。

Result: 实验表明，这些方法显著提升了VSR性能。

Conclusion: LLMs在VSR任务中具有巨大潜力，通过系统优化可进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) transcribes speech by analyzing lip
movements. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been integrated into VSR
systems, leading to notable performance improvements. However, the potential of
LLMs has not been extensively studied, and how to effectively utilize LLMs in
VSR tasks remains unexplored. This paper systematically explores how to better
leverage LLMs for VSR tasks and provides three key contributions: (1) Scaling
Test: We study how the LLM size affects VSR performance, confirming a scaling
law in the VSR task. (2) Context-Aware Decoding: We add contextual text to
guide the LLM decoding, improving recognition accuracy. (3) Iterative
Polishing: We propose iteratively refining LLM outputs, progressively reducing
recognition errors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that by these designs,
the great potential of LLMs can be largely harnessed, leading to significant
VSR performance improvement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自动驾驶和辅助驾驶技术的发展，对复杂驾驶场景的理解能力提出了更高要求，但多模态大模型在垂直领域的应用面临数据收集、模型训练和部署优化等挑战。

Method: 方法包括动态提示优化（根据输入图像调整提示以聚焦关键对象）、数据集构建（结合真实与合成数据）、模型训练（集成知识蒸馏、动态微调和量化技术）以及部署优化。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著提升了模型在关键任务中的准确性，同时实现了高效的资源利用。

Conclusion: 该系统性优化方法为驾驶场景感知技术的实际应用提供了有力支持。

Abstract: With the advancement of autonomous and assisted driving technologies, higher
demands are placed on the ability to understand complex driving scenarios.
Multimodal general large models have emerged as a solution for this challenge.
However, applying these models in vertical domains involves difficulties such
as data collection, model training, and deployment optimization. This paper
proposes a comprehensive method for optimizing multimodal models in driving
scenarios, including cone detection, traffic light recognition, speed limit
recommendation, and intersection alerts. The method covers key aspects such as
dynamic prompt optimization, dataset construction, model training, and
deployment. Specifically, the dynamic prompt optimization adjusts the prompts
based on the input image content to focus on objects affecting the ego vehicle,
enhancing the model's task-specific focus and judgment capabilities. The
dataset is constructed by combining real and synthetic data to create a
high-quality and diverse multimodal training dataset, improving the model's
generalization in complex driving environments. In model training, advanced
techniques like knowledge distillation, dynamic fine-tuning, and quantization
are integrated to reduce storage and computational costs while boosting
performance. Experimental results show that this systematic optimization method
not only significantly improves the model's accuracy in key tasks but also
achieves efficient resource utilization, providing strong support for the
practical application of driving scenario perception technologies.

### [5] [Object-centric Self-improving Preference Optimization for Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02015)
*Yoonjin Oh,Yongjin Kim,Hyomin Kim,Donghwan Chi,Sungwoong Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为OSPO的框架，用于改进多模态大语言模型在文本到图像生成任务中的细粒度视觉理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多模态大语言模型在图像理解和生成方面取得了进展，但在细粒度视觉理解（尤其是文本到图像生成任务）中仍存在不足，且偏好优化方法在该领域的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出了OSPO框架，利用MLLMs的推理能力，通过对象级对比偏好对的自改进机制（包括对象中心提示扰动、密集化和VQA评分）来优化偏好数据。

Result: 在三个代表性的文本到图像生成基准测试中验证了OSPO，结果显示其性能显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: OSPO通过自改进机制有效提升了文本到图像生成任务的性能，填补了偏好优化方法在该领域的空白。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
significantly improved both image understanding and generation capabilities.
Despite these improvements, MLLMs still struggle with fine-grained visual
comprehension, particularly in text-to-image generation tasks. While preference
optimization methods have been explored to address these limitations in image
understanding tasks, their application to image generation remains largely
underexplored. To address this gap, we propose an Object-centric Self-improving
Preference Optimization (OSPO) framework designed for text-to-image generation
by MLLMs. OSPO leverages the intrinsic reasoning abilities of MLLMs without
requiring any external datasets or models. OSPO emphasizes the importance of
high-quality preference pair data, which is critical for effective preference
optimization. To achieve this, it introduces a self-improving mechanism that
autonomously constructs object-level contrastive preference pairs through
object-centric prompt perturbation, densification and VQA scoring. This process
eliminates ambiguous or disproportionate variations commonly found in naively
generated preference pairs, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of preference
optimization. We validate OSPO on three representative compositional
text-to-image benchmarks, demonstrating substantial performance gains over
baseline models.

### [6] [Are classical deep neural networks weakly adversarially robust?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02016)
*Nuolin Sun,Linyuan Wang,Dongyang Li,Bin Yan,Lei Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于层间特征路径相关性的对抗样本检测和图像识别方法，避免了计算开销大的对抗训练，展示了DNN固有的对抗鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗训练虽能提升DNN的对抗鲁棒性，但计算开销大，因此需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 利用DNN每层输出的聚类特性和渐进前馈崩溃现象，构建特征路径并计算其与类中心特征路径的相关性。

Result: 在ResNet-20上，干净准确率为82.77%，对抗准确率为44.17%；在ResNet-18上分别为80.01%和46.1%。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了DNN固有的对抗鲁棒性，挑战了传统对DNN弱对抗鲁棒性的认知。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks have received increasing attention and it has been widely
recognized that classical DNNs have weak adversarial robustness. The most
commonly used adversarial defense method, adversarial training, improves the
adversarial accuracy of DNNs by generating adversarial examples and retraining
the model. However, adversarial training requires a significant computational
overhead. In this paper, inspired by existing studies focusing on the
clustering properties of DNN output features at each layer and the Progressive
Feedforward Collapse phenomenon, we propose a method for adversarial example
detection and image recognition that uses layer-wise features to construct
feature paths and computes the correlation between the examples feature paths
and the class-centered feature paths. Experimental results show that the
recognition method achieves 82.77% clean accuracy and 44.17% adversarial
accuracy on the ResNet-20 with PFC. Compared to the adversarial training method
with 77.64% clean accuracy and 52.94% adversarial accuracy, our method exhibits
a trade-off without relying on computationally expensive defense strategies.
Furthermore, on the standard ResNet-18, our method maintains this advantage
with respective metrics of 80.01% and 46.1%. This result reveals inherent
adversarial robustness in DNNs, challenging the conventional understanding of
the weak adversarial robustness in DNNs.

### [7] [Fairness through Feedback: Addressing Algorithmic Misgendering in Automatic Gender Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02017)
*Camilla Quaresmini,Giacomo Zanotti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了自动性别识别（AGR）系统的问题，提出应重新思考其理论与设计，强调性别、性别表达与生理性别的区分，并建议引入用户反馈机制以提高公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AGR系统通常基于生理性别分类，忽略了性别多样性，导致对非二元性别和性别不一致人群的不可靠性。论文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 论文首先区分了性别、性别表达与生理性别的概念，然后提出通过用户反馈机制改进AGR系统，使其更具包容性。

Result: 研究表明，AGR系统应允许用户纠正输出，以提升公平性，并尊重个体的自我表达权。

Conclusion: AGR系统需重新设计，以尊重性别多样性，并通过反馈机制减少误判，实现更公平的结果。

Abstract: Automatic Gender Recognition (AGR) systems are an increasingly widespread
application in the Machine Learning (ML) landscape. While these systems are
typically understood as detecting gender, they often classify datapoints based
on observable features correlated at best with either male or female sex. In
addition to questionable binary assumptions, from an epistemological point of
view, this is problematic for two reasons. First, there exists a gap between
the categories the system is meant to predict (woman versus man) and those onto
which their output reasonably maps (female versus male). What is more, gender
cannot be inferred on the basis of such observable features. This makes AGR
tools often unreliable, especially in the case of non-binary and gender
non-conforming people. We suggest a theoretical and practical rethinking of AGR
systems. To begin, distinctions are made between sex, gender, and gender
expression. Then, we build upon the observation that, unlike algorithmic
misgendering, human-human misgendering is open to the possibility of
re-evaluation and correction. We suggest that analogous dynamics should be
recreated in AGR, giving users the possibility to correct the system's output.
While implementing such a feedback mechanism could be regarded as diminishing
the system's autonomy, it represents a way to significantly increase fairness
levels in AGR. This is consistent with the conceptual change of paradigm that
we advocate for AGR systems, which should be understood as tools respecting
individuals' rights and capabilities of self-expression and determination.

### [8] [Improve Multi-Modal Embedding Learning via Explicit Hard Negative Gradient Amplifying](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02020)
*Youze Xue,Dian Li,Gang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文分析了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）中硬负样本在对比学习中的作用，提出了一种显式梯度放大方法，显著提升了多模态嵌入的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管CLIP框架已成功扩展到MLLMs，但硬负样本在对比学习中的具体贡献尚未深入研究。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过分析info-NCE损失的梯度，提出显式梯度放大方法，增强硬负样本对模型参数更新的影响。

Result: 基于LLaVA-OneVision-7B架构的模型在MMEB基准测试中达到最优性能，结合自研MLLM（QQMM）后在MMEB排行榜中排名第一。

Conclusion: 显式梯度放大方法有效提升了多模态嵌入的判别性，为对比学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) in
recent years, the foundational Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP)
framework has been successfully extended to MLLMs, enabling more powerful and
universal multi-modal embeddings for a wide range of retrieval tasks. Despite
these developments, the core contrastive learning paradigm remains largely
unchanged from CLIP-style models to MLLMs. Within this framework, the effective
mining of hard negative samples continues to be a critical factor for enhancing
performance. Prior works have introduced both offline and online strategies for
hard negative mining to improve the efficiency of contrastive learning. While
these approaches have led to improved multi-modal embeddings, the specific
contribution of each hard negative sample to the learning process has not been
thoroughly investigated. In this work, we conduct a detailed analysis of the
gradients of the info-NCE loss with respect to the query, positive, and
negative samples, elucidating the role of hard negatives in updating model
parameters. Building upon this analysis, we propose to explicitly amplify the
gradients associated with hard negative samples, thereby encouraging the model
to learn more discriminative embeddings. Our multi-modal embedding model,
trained with the proposed Explicit Gradient Amplifier and based on the
LLaVA-OneVision-7B architecture, achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
MMEB benchmark compared to previous methods utilizing the same MLLM backbone.
Furthermore, when integrated with our self-developed MLLM, QQMM, our approach
attains the top rank on the MMEB leaderboard. Code and models are released on
https://github.com/QQ-MM/QQMM-embed.

### [9] [Dynamic-Aware Video Distillation: Optimizing Temporal Resolution Based on Video Semantics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02021)
*Yinjie Zhao,Heng Zhao,Bihan Wen,Yew-Soon Ong,Joey Tianyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于强化学习的动态感知视频蒸馏方法（DAViD），用于优化视频数据集中的时间分辨率，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉任务和数据集的快速发展，减少数据集冗余成为关键研究方向。尽管数据集蒸馏在图像数据上已有广泛研究，但在视频数据上仍存在挑战，尤其是时间信息的处理和冗余水平的差异。

Method: 提出DAViD方法，利用强化学习预测合成视频的最佳时间分辨率，并通过教师循环奖励函数更新策略。

Result: DAViD显著优于现有方法，性能大幅提升。

Conclusion: 该研究为未来高效且语义自适应的视频数据集蒸馏研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: With the rapid development of vision tasks and the scaling on datasets and
models, redundancy reduction in vision datasets has become a key area of
research. To address this issue, dataset distillation (DD) has emerged as a
promising approach to generating highly compact synthetic datasets with
significantly less redundancy while preserving essential information. However,
while DD has been extensively studied for image datasets, DD on video datasets
remains underexplored. Video datasets present unique challenges due to the
presence of temporal information and varying levels of redundancy across
different classes. Existing DD approaches assume a uniform level of temporal
redundancy across all different video semantics, which limits their
effectiveness on video datasets. In this work, we propose Dynamic-Aware Video
Distillation (DAViD), a Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach to predict the
optimal Temporal Resolution of the synthetic videos. A teacher-in-the-loop
reward function is proposed to update the RL agent policy. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study to introduce adaptive temporal resolution
based on video semantics in video dataset distillation. Our approach
significantly outperforms existing DD methods, demonstrating substantial
improvements in performance. This work paves the way for future research on
more efficient and semantic-adaptive video dataset distillation research.

### [10] [Do You See Me : A Multidimensional Benchmark for Evaluating Visual Perception in Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02022)
*Aditya Kanade,Tanuja Ganu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLLMs在视觉感知上存在明显缺陷，即使答案正确也可能误解关键视觉元素。新基准测试显示人类准确率96.49%，而顶级MLLMs平均低于50%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示MLLMs在视觉感知上的隐性失败，并提供一个系统性评估其视觉能力的基准。

Method: 引入“Do You See Me”基准测试，包含1,758张图像和2,612个问题，涵盖7个心理学启发的子任务，评估MLLMs的视觉技能。

Result: 人类准确率96.49%，MLLMs平均低于50%，任务复杂度增加时差距更大。失败原因包括视觉注意力分配错误和细节表征不稳定。

Conclusion: 亟需开发具有真正鲁棒视觉感知能力的MLLMs，并提供了公开数据集和工具以促进研究。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show reasoning promise, yet their
visual perception is a critical bottleneck. Strikingly, MLLMs can produce
correct answers even while misinterpreting crucial visual elements, masking
these underlying failures. Our preliminary study on a joint
perception-reasoning dataset revealed that for one leading MLLM, 29% of its
correct answers to reasoning questions still exhibited visual perception
errors. To systematically address this, we introduce "Do You See Me", a
scalable benchmark with 1,758 images and 2,612 questions. It spans seven
human-psychology inspired subtasks in 2D and 3D, featuring controllable
complexity to rigorously evaluate MLLM visual skills. Our findings on 3 leading
closed-source and 5 major open-source models reveal a stark deficit: humans
achieve 96.49% accuracy, while top MLLMs average below 50%. This performance
gap widens rapidly with increased task complexity (e.g., from 12% to 45% in the
visual form constancy subtask). Further analysis into the root causes suggests
that failures stem from challenges like misallocated visual attention and the
instability of internal representations for fine-grained details, especially at
or below encoder patch resolution. This underscores an urgent need for MLLMs
with truly robust visual perception. The benchmark dataset, source code and
evaluation scripts are available at https://github.com/microsoft/Do-You-See-Me.

*Hyojin Bahng,Caroline Chan,Fredo Durand,Phillip Isola*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用循环一致性作为监督信号的方法，用于语言与视觉对齐任务，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法依赖昂贵且耗时的人类或AI偏好数据的问题。

Method: 通过文本到图像和图像到文本的循环一致性计算相似性，构建偏好数据集并训练奖励模型。

Result: 在详细描述任务中优于现有对齐指标，且作为验证器在Best-of-N采样中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法在多种视觉语言任务和文本到图像生成中表现出色，数据集和模型已开源。

Abstract: Learning alignment between language and vision is a fundamental challenge,
especially as multimodal data becomes increasingly detailed and complex.
Existing methods often rely on collecting human or AI preferences, which can be
costly and time-intensive. We propose an alternative approach that leverages
cycle consistency as a supervisory signal. Given an image and generated text,
we map the text back to image space using a text-to-image model and compute the
similarity between the original image and its reconstruction. Analogously, for
text-to-image generation, we measure the textual similarity between an input
caption and its reconstruction through the cycle. We use the cycle consistency
score to rank candidates and construct a preference dataset of 866K comparison
pairs. The reward model trained on our dataset outperforms state-of-the-art
alignment metrics on detailed captioning, with superior inference-time
scalability when used as a verifier for Best-of-N sampling. Furthermore,
performing DPO and Diffusion DPO using our dataset enhances performance across
a wide range of vision-language tasks and text-to-image generation. Our
dataset, model, and code are at https://cyclereward.github.io

*Shiyu Shen,Bin Pan,Ziye Zhang,Zhenwei Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于高光谱解混的新型扩散模型，通过解混自编码器和丰度扩散模块，解决了高维度和物理约束问题，生成高质量且多样化的高光谱图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成模型依赖条件生成方案，限制了生成图像的多样性，且高光谱数据的高维度和物理约束对扩散模型提出了挑战。

Method: 模型包含解混自编码器模块和丰度扩散模块，前者将生成任务转移到低维丰度空间，后者确保生成样本满足非负性和一致性约束。

Result: 实验结果表明，模型能够生成高质量且多样化的高光谱图像，并通过传统指标和提出的新指标验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该模型在高光谱数据生成方面取得了进展，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Recently, hyperspectral image generation has received increasing attention,
but existing generative models rely on conditional generation schemes, which
limits the diversity of generated images. Diffusion models are popular for
their ability to generate high-quality samples, but adapting these models from
RGB to hyperspectral data presents the challenge of high dimensionality and
physical constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a novel diffusion
model guided by hyperspectral unmixing. Our model comprises two key modules: an
unmixing autoencoder module and an abundance diffusion module. The unmixing
autoencoder module leverages unmixing guidance to shift the generative task
from the image space to the low-dimensional abundance space, significantly
reducing computational complexity while preserving high fidelity. The abundance
diffusion module generates samples that satisfy the constraints of
non-negativity and unity, ensuring the physical consistency of the
reconstructed HSIs. Additionally, we introduce two evaluation metrics tailored
to hyperspectral data. Empirical results, evaluated using both traditional
metrics and our proposed metrics, indicate that our model is capable of
generating high-quality and diverse hyperspectral images, offering an
advancement in hyperspectral data generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出新任务“Map and Locate”，结合开放词汇分割与3D重建，并介绍基线方法SAB3R，性能优于单独使用MASt3R和CLIP。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 统一开放词汇分割和3D重建任务，推动现实世界AI应用发展。

Method: 基于MASt3R，引入轻量级蒸馏策略，将2D视觉骨干的语义特征迁移至3D模型。

Result: SAB3R在Map and Locate基准测试中表现优异，并在2D语义分割和3D任务中验证有效性。

Conclusion: SAB3R成功结合分割与重建，为AI应用提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce a new task, Map and Locate, which unifies the traditionally
distinct objectives of open-vocabulary segmentation - detecting and segmenting
object instances based on natural language queries - and 3D reconstruction, the
process of estimating a scene's 3D structure from visual inputs. Specifically,
Map and Locate involves generating a point cloud from an unposed video and
segmenting object instances based on open-vocabulary queries. This task serves
as a critical step toward real-world embodied AI applications and introduces a
practical task that bridges reconstruction, recognition and reorganization. To
tackle this task, we introduce a simple yet effective baseline, which we denote
as SAB3R. Our approach builds upon MASt3R, a recent breakthrough in 3D computer
vision, and incorporates a lightweight distillation strategy. This method
transfers dense, per-pixel semantic features from 2D vision backbones (eg, CLIP
and DINOv2) to enhance MASt3R's capabilities. Without introducing any auxiliary
frozen networks, our model generates per-pixel semantic features and constructs
cohesive point maps in a single forward pass. Compared to separately deploying
MASt3R and CLIP, our unified model, SAB3R, achieves superior performance on the
Map and Locate benchmark. Furthermore, we evaluate SAB3R on both 2D semantic
segmentation and 3D tasks to comprehensively validate its effectiveness.

Abstract: Due to strong learning abilities of convolutional neural networks (CNNs),
they have become mainstream methods for image super-resolution. However, there
are big differences of different deep learning methods with different types.
There is little literature to summarize relations and differences of different
methods in image super-resolution. Thus, summarizing these literatures are
important, according to loading capacity and execution speed of devices. This
paper first introduces principles of CNNs in image super-resolution, then
introduces CNNs based bicubic interpolation, nearest neighbor interpolation,
bilinear interpolation, transposed convolution, sub-pixel layer, meta
up-sampling for image super-resolution to analyze differences and relations of
different CNNs based interpolations and modules, and compare performance of
these methods by experiments. Finally, this paper gives potential research
points and drawbacks and summarizes the whole paper, which can facilitate
developments of CNNs in image super-resolution.

Abstract: Deformable medical image registration is an essential task in
computer-assisted interventions. This problem is particularly relevant to
oncological treatments, where precise image alignment is necessary for tracking
tumor growth, assessing treatment response, and ensuring accurate delivery of
therapies. Recent AI methods can outperform traditional techniques in accuracy
and speed, yet they often produce unreliable deformations that limit their
clinical adoption. In this work, we address this challenge and introduce a
novel implicit registration framework that can predict accurate and reliable
deformations. Our insight is to reformulate image registration as a signal
reconstruction problem: we learn a kernel function that can recover the dense
displacement field from sparse keypoint correspondences. We integrate our
method in a novel hierarchical architecture, and estimate the displacement
field in a coarse-to-fine manner. Our formulation also allows for efficient
refinement at test time, permitting clinicians to easily adjust registrations
when needed. We validate our method on challenging intra-patient thoracic and
abdominal zero-shot registration tasks, using public and internal datasets from
the local University Hospital. Our method not only shows competitive accuracy
to state-of-the-art approaches, but also bridges the generalization gap between
implicit and explicit registration techniques. In particular, our method
generates deformations that better preserve anatomical relationships and
matches the performance of specialized commercial systems, underscoring its
potential for clinical adoption.

*Julius Erbach,Dominik Narnhofer,Andreas Dombos,Bernt Schiele,Jan Eric Lenssen,Konrad Schindler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FLAIR是一种新型的无训练变分框架，利用基于流的生成模型作为逆问题的先验，通过变分目标和确定性轨迹调整提升重建质量和样本多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于流的生成模型（如Stable Diffusion 3）在图像生成中表现优异，但在逆成像问题中尚未达到类似保真度，存在非线性映射、数据似然难解和罕见模式恢复困难等障碍。

Method: 提出FLAIR框架，结合变分目标和确定性轨迹调整，解耦数据保真度和正则化优化，并引入时间依赖的校准方案。

Result: 在标准成像基准测试中，FLAIR在重建质量和样本多样性上均优于现有基于扩散和流的方法。

Conclusion: FLAIR为逆问题提供了一种高效且无需额外训练的先验利用方法，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Flow-based latent generative models such as Stable Diffusion 3 are able to
generate images with remarkable quality, even enabling photorealistic
text-to-image generation. Their impressive performance suggests that these
models should also constitute powerful priors for inverse imaging problems, but
that approach has not yet led to comparable fidelity. There are several key
obstacles: (i) the encoding into a lower-dimensional latent space makes the
underlying (forward) mapping non-linear; (ii) the data likelihood term is
usually intractable; and (iii) learned generative models struggle to recover
rare, atypical data modes during inference. We present FLAIR, a novel training
free variational framework that leverages flow-based generative models as a
prior for inverse problems. To that end, we introduce a variational objective
for flow matching that is agnostic to the type of degradation, and combine it
with deterministic trajectory adjustments to recover atypical modes. To enforce
exact consistency with the observed data, we decouple the optimization of the
data fidelity and regularization terms. Moreover, we introduce a time-dependent
calibration scheme in which the strength of the regularization is modulated
according to off-line accuracy estimates. Results on standard imaging
benchmarks demonstrate that FLAIR consistently outperforms existing diffusion-
and flow-based methods in terms of reconstruction quality and sample diversity.

Conclusion: TIIF-Bench为T2I模型的细粒度评估提供了系统化的工具，有助于推动模型性能的提升。

Abstract: The rapid advancements of Text-to-Image (T2I) models have ushered in a new
phase of AI-generated content, marked by their growing ability to interpret and
follow user instructions. However, existing T2I model evaluation benchmarks
fall short in limited prompt diversity and complexity, as well as coarse
evaluation metrics, making it difficult to evaluate the fine-grained alignment
performance between textual instructions and generated images. In this paper,
we present TIIF-Bench (Text-to-Image Instruction Following Benchmark), aiming
to systematically assess T2I models' ability in interpreting and following
intricate textual instructions. TIIF-Bench comprises a set of 5000 prompts
organized along multiple dimensions, which are categorized into three levels of
difficulties and complexities. To rigorously evaluate model robustness to
varying prompt lengths, we provide a short and a long version for each prompt
with identical core semantics. Two critical attributes, i.e., text rendering
and style control, are introduced to evaluate the precision of text synthesis
and the aesthetic coherence of T2I models. In addition, we collect 100
high-quality designer level prompts that encompass various scenarios to
comprehensively assess model performance. Leveraging the world knowledge
encoded in large vision language models, we propose a novel computable
framework to discern subtle variations in T2I model outputs. Through meticulous
benchmarking of mainstream T2I models on TIIF-Bench, we analyze the pros and
cons of current T2I models and reveal the limitations of current T2I
benchmarks. Project Page: https://a113n-w3i.github.io/TIIF_Bench/.

Conclusion: AstroDiff为天文图像湍流修复提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Photography is the cornerstone of modern astronomical and space research.
However, most astronomical images captured by ground-based telescopes suffer
from atmospheric turbulence, resulting in degraded imaging quality. While
multi-frame strategies like lucky imaging can mitigate some effects, they
involve intensive data acquisition and complex manual processing. In this
paper, we propose AstroDiff, a generative restoration method that leverages
both the high-quality generative priors and restoration capabilities of
diffusion models to mitigate atmospheric turbulence. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that AstroDiff outperforms existing state-of-the-art learning-based
methods in astronomical image turbulence mitigation, providing higher
perceptual quality and better structural fidelity under severe turbulence
conditions. Our code and additional results are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨深度神经网络与猴子大脑在图像分类任务中决策策略的相似性，解决以往研究结果不一致的问题。

Method: 使用决策变量相关性（DVC）量化分类任务中解码决策的相关性，评估模型与猴子V4/IT记录的相似性。

Result: 模型间相似性与猴子间相似性相当，但模型与猴子相似性较低且随模型性能提升而降低；对抗训练和更大数据集预训练未改善模型与猴子相似性。

Conclusion: 猴子V4/IT与图像分类模型在任务相关表征上存在根本差异。

Abstract: Previous studies have compared the brain and deep neural networks trained on
image classification. Intriguingly, while some suggest that their
representations are highly similar, others argued the opposite. Here, we
propose a new approach to characterize the similarity of the decision
strategies of two observers (models or brains) using decision variable
correlation (DVC). DVC quantifies the correlation between decoded decisions on
individual samples in a classification task and thus can capture task-relevant
information rather than general representational alignment. We evaluate this
method using monkey V4/IT recordings and models trained on image classification
tasks.
  We find that model--model similarity is comparable to monkey--monkey
similarity, whereas model--monkey similarity is consistently lower and,
surprisingly, decreases with increasing ImageNet-1k performance. While
adversarial training enhances robustness, it does not improve model--monkey
similarity in task-relevant dimensions; however, it markedly increases
model--model similarity. Similarly, pre-training on larger datasets does not
improve model--monkey similarity. These results suggest a fundamental
divergence between the task-relevant representations in monkey V4/IT and those
learned by models trained on image classification tasks.

Motivation: 消防员在恶劣环境中常因感知问题受伤，现有AI系统在此类场景中表现不佳，亟需改进。

Method: 通过收集专业训练视频并标注动作、物体位置和退化数据，构建Fire360数据集，支持五项任务评估模型能力。

Result: 人类专家在TOR任务中表现优异（83.5%），而GPT-4o等模型表现较差，显示其在退化环境下推理能力不足。

Conclusion: Fire360的发布旨在推动AI在不确定性环境中的感知、记忆和推理能力发展。

Abstract: Modern AI systems struggle most in environments where reliability is critical
- scenes with smoke, poor visibility, and structural deformation. Each year,
tens of thousands of firefighters are injured on duty, often due to breakdowns
in situational perception. We introduce Fire360, a benchmark for evaluating
perception and reasoning in safety-critical firefighting scenarios. The dataset
includes 228 360-degree videos from professional training sessions under
diverse conditions (e.g., low light, thermal distortion), annotated with action
segments, object locations, and degradation metadata. Fire360 supports five
tasks: Visual Question Answering, Temporal Action Captioning, Object
Localization, Safety-Critical Reasoning, and Transformed Object Retrieval
(TOR). TOR tests whether models can match pristine exemplars to fire-damaged
counterparts in unpaired scenes, evaluating transformation-invariant
recognition. While human experts achieve 83.5% on TOR, models like GPT-4o lag
significantly, exposing failures in reasoning under degradation. By releasing
Fire360 and its evaluation suite, we aim to advance models that not only see,
but also remember, reason, and act under uncertainty. The dataset is available

<details>

Motivation: 当前基础FM模型在微调时计算成本高，而扩散模型（如Stable Diffusion）具有高效架构和生态系统支持，Diff2Flow旨在解决如何高效将扩散模型知识迁移到FM中的关键挑战。

Method: 提出Diff2Flow框架，通过时间步重缩放、对齐插值和从扩散预测中导出FM兼容的速度场，系统性地桥接扩散模型和FM范式。

Result: Diff2Flow在参数高效约束下优于朴素FM和扩散微调，并在多样下游任务中达到或超越现有最优方法的性能。

Conclusion: Diff2Flow成功实现了扩散模型到FM的高效知识迁移，为生成任务提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have revolutionized generative tasks through high-fidelity
outputs, yet flow matching (FM) offers faster inference and empirical
performance gains. However, current foundation FM models are computationally
prohibitive for finetuning, while diffusion models like Stable Diffusion
benefit from efficient architectures and ecosystem support. This work addresses
the critical challenge of efficiently transferring knowledge from pre-trained
diffusion models to flow matching. We propose Diff2Flow, a novel framework that
systematically bridges diffusion and FM paradigms by rescaling timesteps,
aligning interpolants, and deriving FM-compatible velocity fields from
diffusion predictions. This alignment enables direct and efficient FM
finetuning of diffusion priors with no extra computation overhead. Our
experiments demonstrate that Diff2Flow outperforms na\"ive FM and diffusion
finetuning particularly under parameter-efficient constraints, while achieving
superior or competitive performance across diverse downstream tasks compared to
state-of-the-art methods. We will release our code at

Motivation: 胎盘病理检查对检测和缓解分娩相关健康风险有效，但现有自动化方法计算量大，限制了其部署。

Method: 提出两种改进：1）文本锚定的视觉-语言对比知识蒸馏（VLCD）；2）使用自然图像数据集进行无监督预蒸馏以优化初始化。

Result: 方法在性能和鲁棒性上匹配或超越教师模型，尤其适用于低质量图像。

Conclusion: VLCD提高了医疗视觉-语言对比学习方法的效率和可部署性，使AI医疗解决方案更易在资源有限环境中应用。

Abstract: Pathological examination of the placenta is an effective method for detecting
and mitigating health risks associated with childbirth. Recent advancements in
AI have enabled the use of photographs of the placenta and pathology reports
for detecting and classifying signs of childbirth-related pathologies. However,
existing automated methods are computationally extensive, which limits their
deployability. We propose two modifications to vision-language contrastive
learning (VLC) frameworks to enhance their accuracy and efficiency: (1)
text-anchored vision-language contrastive knowledge distillation (VLCD)-a new
knowledge distillation strategy for medical VLC pretraining, and (2)
unsupervised predistillation using a large natural images dataset for improved
initialization. Our approach distills efficient neural networks that match or
surpass the teacher model in performance while achieving model compression and
acceleration. Our results showcase the value of unsupervised predistillation in
improving the performance and robustness of our approach, specifically for
lower-quality images. VLCD serves as an effective way to improve the efficiency
and deployability of medical VLC approaches, making AI-based healthcare
solutions more accessible, especially in resource-constrained environments.

Motivation: 当前扩散视频生成方法依赖统计学习，缺乏对物理运动的显式建模，导致非物理伪影。本文旨在通过频率域分析提升物理合理性。

Method: 1. 分析物理运动的频率特征；2. 设计物理运动损失函数；3. 提出频率域增强模块，通过零初始化策略调整视频特征。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了运动质量和物理合理性，且不影响视觉质量或语义对齐。

Conclusion: 该框架为深度学习视频合成提供了物理约束的通用方法，连接了数据驱动模型与物理运动模型。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based video generation have yielded
unprecedented quality in visual content and semantic coherence. However,
current approaches predominantly rely on statistical learning from vast
datasets without explicitly modeling the underlying physics of motion,
resulting in subtle yet perceptible non-physical artifacts that diminish the
realism of generated videos. This paper introduces a physics-informed frequency
domain approach to enhance the physical plausibility of generated videos. We
first conduct a systematic analysis of the frequency-domain characteristics of
diverse physical motions (translation, rotation, scaling), revealing that each
motion type exhibits distinctive and identifiable spectral signatures. Building
on this theoretical foundation, we propose two complementary components: (1) a
physical motion loss function that quantifies and optimizes the conformity of
generated videos to ideal frequency-domain motion patterns, and (2) a frequency
domain enhancement module that progressively learns to adjust video features to
conform to physical motion constraints while preserving original network
functionality through a zero-initialization strategy. Experiments across
multiple video diffusion architectures demonstrate that our approach
significantly enhances motion quality and physical plausibility without
compromising visual quality or semantic alignment. Our frequency-domain
physical motion framework generalizes effectively across different video
generation architectures, offering a principled approach to incorporating
physical constraints into deep learning-based video synthesis pipelines. This
work seeks to establish connections between data-driven models and
physics-based motion models.

Result: 在Ego4D ASD基准测试中达到76.6% mAP，超越LoCoNet和STHG。

Conclusion: 预训练音频先验和对齐融合方法在现实场景中具有显著优势。

Abstract: Active speaker detection (ASD) in egocentric videos presents unique
challenges due to unstable viewpoints, motion blur, and off-screen speech
sources - conditions under which traditional visual-centric methods degrade
significantly. We introduce PAIR-Net (Pretrained Audio-Visual Integration with
Regularization Network), an effective model that integrates a partially frozen
Whisper audio encoder with a fine-tuned AV-HuBERT visual backbone to robustly
fuse cross-modal cues. To counteract modality imbalance, we introduce an
inter-modal alignment loss that synchronizes audio and visual representations,
enabling more consistent convergence across modalities. Without relying on
multi-speaker context or ideal frontal views, PAIR-Net achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the Ego4D ASD benchmark with 76.6% mAP,
surpassing LoCoNet and STHG by 8.2% and 12.9% mAP, respectively. Our results
highlight the value of pretrained audio priors and alignment-based fusion for
robust ASD under real-world egocentric conditions.

TL;DR: Rig3R是一种多视角3D重建模型，通过结合或推断相机设备结构，显著提升了3D重建和相机姿态估计的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如DUSt3R）将图像视为无结构集合，限制了在同步设备场景中的效果。Rig3R旨在利用或推断设备结构以提升性能。

Method: Rig3R结合可选设备元数据（如相机ID、时间、姿态），构建设备感知的潜在空间，并联合预测点图和两种射线图（全局和设备中心）。

Result: Rig3R在3D重建、相机姿态估计和设备结构推断上表现最优，比传统和基于学习的方法提升17-45% mAA。

Conclusion: Rig3R通过设备感知设计，在单次前向传播中实现高性能，无需后处理或迭代优化。

Abstract: Estimating agent pose and 3D scene structure from multi-camera rigs is a
central task in embodied AI applications such as autonomous driving. Recent
learned approaches such as DUSt3R have shown impressive performance in
multiview settings. However, these models treat images as unstructured
collections, limiting effectiveness in scenarios where frames are captured from
synchronized rigs with known or inferable structure.
  To this end, we introduce Rig3R, a generalization of prior multiview
reconstruction models that incorporates rig structure when available, and
learns to infer it when not. Rig3R conditions on optional rig metadata
including camera ID, time, and rig poses to develop a rig-aware latent space
that remains robust to missing information. It jointly predicts pointmaps and
two types of raymaps: a pose raymap relative to a global frame, and a rig
raymap relative to a rig-centric frame consistent across time. Rig raymaps
allow the model to infer rig structure directly from input images when metadata
is missing.
  Rig3R achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D reconstruction, camera pose
estimation, and rig discovery, outperforming both traditional and learned
methods by 17-45% mAA across diverse real-world rig datasets, all in a single
forward pass without post-processing or iterative refinement.

Abstract: Despite advances in multimodal learning, challenging benchmarks for
mixed-modal image retrieval that combines visual and textual information are
lacking. This paper introduces a novel benchmark to rigorously evaluate image
retrieval that demands deep cross-modal contextual understanding. We present
two new datasets: the Entity Image Dataset (EI), providing canonical images for
Wikipedia entities, and the Mixed-Modal Image Retrieval Dataset (MMIR), derived
from the WIT dataset. The MMIR benchmark features two challenging query types
requiring models to ground textual descriptions in the context of provided
visual entities: single entity-image queries (one entity image with descriptive
text) and multi-entity-image queries (multiple entity images with relational
text). We empirically validate the benchmark's utility as both a training
corpus and an evaluation set for mixed-modal retrieval. The quality of both
datasets is further affirmed through crowd-sourced human annotations. The
datasets are accessible through the GitHub page:

Abstract: Large foundation models trained on extensive datasets demonstrate strong
zero-shot capabilities in various domains. To replicate their success when data
and model size are constrained, knowledge distillation has become an
established tool for transferring knowledge from foundation models to small
student networks. However, the effectiveness of distillation is critically
limited by the available training data. This work addresses the common
practical issue of covariate shift in knowledge distillation, where spurious
features appear during training but not at test time. We ask the question: when
these spurious features are unknown, yet a robust teacher is available, is it
possible for a student to also become robust to them? We address this problem
by introducing a novel diffusion-based data augmentation strategy that
generates images by maximizing the disagreement between the teacher and the
student, effectively creating challenging samples that the student struggles
with. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves worst
group and mean group accuracy on CelebA and SpuCo Birds as well as the spurious
mAUC on spurious ImageNet under covariate shift, outperforming state-of-the-art
diffusion-based data augmentation baselines

Conclusion: MeWM为医学世界模型的未来应用奠定了基础，显著提升临床决策效果。

Abstract: Providing effective treatment and making informed clinical decisions are
essential goals of modern medicine and clinical care. We are interested in
simulating disease dynamics for clinical decision-making, leveraging recent
advances in large generative models. To this end, we introduce the Medical
World Model (MeWM), the first world model in medicine that visually predicts
future disease states based on clinical decisions. MeWM comprises (i)
vision-language models to serve as policy models, and (ii) tumor generative
models as dynamics models. The policy model generates action plans, such as
clinical treatments, while the dynamics model simulates tumor progression or
regression under given treatment conditions. Building on this, we propose the
inverse dynamics model that applies survival analysis to the simulated
post-treatment tumor, enabling the evaluation of treatment efficacy and the
selection of the optimal clinical action plan. As a result, the proposed MeWM
simulates disease dynamics by synthesizing post-treatment tumors, with
state-of-the-art specificity in Turing tests evaluated by radiologists.
Simultaneously, its inverse dynamics model outperforms medical-specialized GPTs
in optimizing individualized treatment protocols across all metrics. Notably,

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种互惠学习框架（RLF）和类分布正则化（CDR）方法，以解决广义类别发现（GCD）中基类识别不可靠的问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 广义类别发现（GCD）中，现有参数化方法因不可靠的自监督导致基类识别能力不足。

Method: 提出互惠学习框架（RLF）和类分布正则化（CDR），通过辅助分支和软标签优化基类识别，并减少对基类的学习偏差。

Result: 在七个GCD数据集上验证，RLCD方法在所有类别中表现优异，且计算开销可忽略。

Conclusion: RLCD通过RLF和CDR显著提升了GCD任务的性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to identify unlabeled samples by
leveraging the base knowledge from labeled ones, where the unlabeled set
consists of both base and novel classes. Since clustering methods are
time-consuming at inference, parametric-based approaches have become more
popular. However, recent parametric-based methods suffer from inferior base
discrimination due to unreliable self-supervision. To address this issue, we
propose a Reciprocal Learning Framework (RLF) that introduces an auxiliary
branch devoted to base classification. During training, the main branch filters
the pseudo-base samples to the auxiliary branch. In response, the auxiliary
branch provides more reliable soft labels for the main branch, leading to a
virtuous cycle. Furthermore, we introduce Class-wise Distribution
Regularization (CDR) to mitigate the learning bias towards base classes. CDR
essentially increases the prediction confidence of the unlabeled data and
boosts the novel class performance. Combined with both components, our proposed
method, RLCD, achieves superior performance in all classes with negligible
extra computation. Comprehensive experiments across seven GCD datasets validate
its superiority. Our codes are available at https://github.com/APORduo/RLCD.

Abstract: Object Navigation (ObjectNav) is a fundamental task in embodied artificial
intelligence. Although significant progress has been made in semantic map
construction and target direction prediction in current research, redundant
exploration and exploration failures remain inevitable. A critical but
underexplored direction is the timely termination of exploration to overcome
these challenges. We observe a diminishing marginal effect between exploration
steps and exploration rates and analyze the cost-benefit relationship of
exploration. Inspired by this, we propose RATE-Nav, a Region-Aware
Termination-Enhanced method. It includes a geometric predictive region
segmentation algorithm and region-Based exploration estimation algorithm for
exploration rate calculation. By leveraging the visual question answering
capabilities of visual language models (VLMs) and exploration rates enables
efficient termination.RATE-Nav achieves a success rate of 67.8% and an SPL of
31.3% on the HM3D dataset. And on the more challenging MP3D dataset, RATE-Nav
shows approximately 10% improvement over previous zero-shot methods.

Conclusion: InterRVOS任务和ReVIOSa模型为视频中对象交互的分割和理解提供了新方向。

Abstract: Referring video object segmentation aims to segment the object in a video
corresponding to a given natural language expression. While prior works have
explored various referring scenarios, including motion-centric or
multi-instance expressions, most approaches still focus on localizing a single
target object in isolation. However, in comprehensive video understanding, an
object's role is often defined by its interactions with other entities, which
are largely overlooked in existing datasets and models. In this work, we
introduce Interaction-aware referring video object sgementation (InterRVOS), a
new task that requires segmenting both actor and target entities involved in an
interaction. Each interactoin is described through a pair of complementary
expressions from different semantic perspectives, enabling fine-grained
modeling of inter-object relationships. To tackle this task, we propose
InterRVOS-8K, the large-scale and automatically constructed dataset containing
diverse interaction-aware expressions with corresponding masks, including
challenging cases such as motion-only multi-instance expressions. We also
present a baseline architecture, ReVIOSa, designed to handle actor-target
segmentation from a single expression, achieving strong performance in both
standard and interaction-focused settings. Furthermore, we introduce an
actor-target-aware evalaution setting that enables a more targeted assessment
of interaction understanding. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach outperforms prior methods in modeling complex object interactions for
referring video object segmentation task, establishing a strong foundation for
future research in interaction-centric video understanding. Our project page is

Conclusion: RoadFormer在道路表面分类任务中表现优异，显著提升了自动驾驶系统的路面感知可靠性。

Abstract: The classification of the type of road surface (RSC) aims to utilize pavement
features to identify the roughness, wet and dry conditions, and material
information of the road surface. Due to its ability to effectively enhance road
safety and traffic management, it has received widespread attention in recent
years. In autonomous driving, accurate RSC allows vehicles to better understand
the road environment, adjust driving strategies, and ensure a safer and more
efficient driving experience. For a long time, vision-based RSC has been
favored. However, existing visual classification methods have overlooked the
exploration of fine-grained classification of pavement types (such as similar
pavement textures). In this work, we propose a pure vision-based fine-grained
RSC method for autonomous driving scenarios, which fuses local and global
feature information through the stacking of convolutional and transformer
modules. We further explore the stacking strategies of local and global feature
extraction modules to find the optimal feature extraction strategy. In
addition, since fine-grained tasks also face the challenge of relatively large
intra-class differences and relatively small inter-class differences, we
propose a Foreground-Background Module (FBM) that effectively extracts
fine-grained context features of the pavement, enhancing the classification
ability for complex pavements. Experiments conducted on a large-scale pavement
dataset containing one million samples and a simplified dataset reorganized
from this dataset achieved Top-1 classification accuracies of 92.52% and
96.50%, respectively, improving by 5.69% to 12.84% compared to SOTA methods.
These results demonstrate that RoadFormer outperforms existing methods in RSC
tasks, providing significant progress in improving the reliability of pavement
perception in autonomous driving systems.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个数据集上表现接近传统标注方法，同时大幅降低标注成本和时间。

Conclusion: 该方法是一种可行的替代方案，兼具性能和效率优势。

Abstract: Great labels make great models. However, traditional labeling approaches for
tasks like object detection have substantial costs at scale. Furthermore,
alternatives to fully-supervised object detection either lose functionality or
require larger models with prohibitive computational costs for inference at
scale. To that end, this paper addresses the problem of training standard
object detection models without any ground truth labels. Instead, we configure
previously-trained vision-language foundation models to generate
application-specific pseudo "ground truth" labels. These auto-generated labels
directly integrate with existing model training frameworks, and we subsequently
train lightweight detection models that are computationally efficient. In this
way, we avoid the costs of traditional labeling, leverage the knowledge of
vision-language models, and keep the efficiency of lightweight models for
practical application. We perform exhaustive experiments across multiple
labeling configurations, downstream inference models, and datasets to establish
best practices and set an extensive auto-labeling benchmark. From our results,
we find that our approach is a viable alternative to standard labeling in that
it maintains competitive performance on multiple datasets and substantially
reduces labeling time and costs.

<details>

Motivation: 高光谱图像（HSIs）在采集和传输过程中常受复杂混合噪声影响，现有混合方法在模块交替和互补性利用上不足。

Method: 结合低秩模块（阈值张量奇异值分解）和稀疏模块（Top-K稀疏变换器），通过深度展开网络实现紧密耦合。

Result: 在合成和真实HSIs上实验表明，DU-TRPCA在严重混合噪声下优于现有方法，且具有可解释性和稳定去噪动态。

Conclusion: DU-TRPCA通过紧密耦合低秩和稀疏模块，显著提升了高光谱图像去噪性能。

Abstract: Hyperspectral images (HSIs) are often degraded by complex mixed noise during
acquisition and transmission, making effective denoising essential for
subsequent analysis. Recent hybrid approaches that bridge model-driven and
data-driven paradigms have shown great promise. However, most of these
approaches lack effective alternation between different priors or modules,
resulting in loosely coupled regularization and insufficient exploitation of
their complementary strengths. Inspired by tensor robust principal component
analysis (TRPCA), we propose a novel deep unfolding network (DU-TRPCA) that
enforces stage-wise alternation between two tightly integrated modules:
low-rank and sparse. The low-rank module employs thresholded tensor singular
value decomposition (t-SVD), providing a widely adopted convex surrogate for
tensor low-rankness and has been demonstrated to effectively capture the global
spatial-spectral structure of HSIs. The Top-K sparse transformer module
adaptively imposes sparse constraints, directly matching the sparse
regularization in TRPCA and enabling effective removal of localized outliers
and complex noise. This tightly coupled architecture preserves the stage-wise
alternation between low-rank approximation and sparse refinement inherent in
TRPCA, while enhancing representational capacity through attention mechanisms.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world HSIs demonstrate that
DU-TRPCA surpasses state-of-the-art methods under severe mixed noise, while
offering interpretability benefits and stable denoising dynamics inspired by
iterative optimization. Code is available at

Conclusion: GBABS是一种通用的边界采样方法，能有效提升噪声数据集的分类性能。

Abstract: Data sampling enhances classifier efficiency and robustness through data
compression and quality improvement. Recently, the sampling method based on
granular-ball (GB) has shown promising performance in generality and noisy
classification tasks. However, some limitations remain, including the absence
of borderline sampling strategies and issues with class boundary blurring or
shrinking due to overlap between GBs. In this paper, an approximate borderline
sampling method using GBs is proposed for classification tasks. First, a
restricted diffusion-based GB generation (RD-GBG) method is proposed, which
prevents GB overlaps by constrained expansion, preserving precise geometric
representation of GBs via redefined ones. Second, based on the concept of
heterogeneous nearest neighbor, a GB-based approximate borderline sampling
(GBABS) method is proposed, which is the first general sampling method capable
of both borderline sampling and improving the quality of class noise datasets.
Additionally, since RD-GBG incorporates noise detection and GBABS focuses on
borderline samples, GBABS performs outstandingly on class noise datasets
without the need for an optimal purity threshold. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform the GB-based sampling method
and several representative sampling methods. Our source code is publicly
available at https://github.com/CherylTse/GBABS.

Conclusion: ViTNF在广义类别发现任务中具有显著优势。

Abstract: Generalized category discovery (GCD) is a highly popular task in open-world
recognition, aiming to identify unknown class samples using known class data.
By leveraging pre-training, meta-training, and fine-tuning, ViT achieves
excellent few-shot learning capabilities. Its MLP head is a feedforward
network, trained synchronously with the entire network in the same process,
increasing the training cost and difficulty without fully leveraging the power
of the feature extractor. This paper proposes a new architecture by replacing
the MLP head with a neural field-based one. We first present a new static
neural field function to describe the activity distribution of the neural field
and then use two static neural field functions to build an efficient few-shot
classifier. This neural field-based (NF) classifier consists of two coupled
static neural fields. It stores the feature information of support samples by
its elementary field, the known categories by its high-level field, and the
category information of support samples by its cross-field connections. We
replace the MLP head with the proposed NF classifier, resulting in a novel
architecture ViTNF, and simplify the three-stage training mode by pre-training
the feature extractor on source tasks and training the NF classifier with
support samples in meta-testing separately, significantly reducing ViT's demand
for training samples and the difficulty of model training. To enhance the
model's capability in identifying new categories, we provide an effective
algorithm to determine the lateral interaction scale of the elementary field.
Experimental results demonstrate that our model surpasses existing
state-of-the-art methods on CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, CUB-200, and Standard
Cars, achieving dramatic accuracy improvements of 19\% and 16\% in new and all
classes, respectively, indicating a notable advantage in GCD.

Conclusion: 多模态和层次化建模在动作预测中具有潜力，为未来研究设定了新基准。

Abstract: Action anticipation, the task of predicting future actions from partially
observed videos, is crucial for advancing intelligent systems. Unlike action
recognition, which operates on fully observed videos, action anticipation must
handle incomplete information. Hence, it requires temporal reasoning, and
inherent uncertainty handling. While recent advances have been made,
traditional methods often focus solely on visual modalities, neglecting the
potential of integrating multiple sources of information. Drawing inspiration
from human behavior, we introduce \textit{Multi-level and Multi-modal Action
Anticipation (m\&m-Ant)}, a novel multi-modal action anticipation approach that
combines both visual and textual cues, while explicitly modeling hierarchical
semantic information for more accurate predictions. To address the challenge of
inaccurate coarse action labels, we propose a fine-grained label generator
paired with a specialized temporal consistency loss function to optimize
performance. Extensive experiments on widely used datasets, including
Breakfast, 50 Salads, and DARai, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,
achieving state-of-the-art results with an average anticipation accuracy
improvement of 3.08\% over existing methods. This work underscores the
potential of multi-modal and hierarchical modeling in advancing action
anticipation and establishes a new benchmark for future research in the field.

Conclusion: RRCA-Net在红外小目标检测中实现了高效且高性能的检测，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection is a challenging task due to its unique
characteristics (e.g., small, dim, shapeless and changeable). Recently
published CNN-based methods have achieved promising performance with heavy
feature extraction and fusion modules. To achieve efficient and effective
detection, we propose a recurrent reusable-convolution attention network
(RRCA-Net) for infrared small target detection. Specifically, RRCA-Net
incorporates reusable-convolution block (RuCB) in a recurrent manner without
introducing extra parameters. With the help of the repetitive iteration in
RuCB, the high-level information of small targets in the deep layers can be
well maintained and further refined. Then, a dual interactive attention
aggregation module (DIAAM) is proposed to promote the mutual enhancement and
fusion of refined information. In this way, RRCA-Net can both achieve
high-level feature refinement and enhance the correlation of contextual
information between adjacent layers. Moreover, to achieve steady convergence,
we design a target characteristic inspired loss function (DpT-k loss) by
integrating physical and mathematical constraints. Experimental results on
three benchmark datasets (e.g. NUAA-SIRST, IRSTD-1k, DenseSIRST) demonstrate
that our RRCA-Net can achieve comparable performance to the state-of-the-art
methods while maintaining a small number of parameters, and act as a plug and
play module to introduce consistent performance improvement for several popular
IRSTD methods. Our code will be available at https://github.com/yongxianLiu/

Conclusion: DiffND框架在夜间去雾和亮度重建方面表现出色。

Abstract: While nighttime image dehazing has been extensively studied, converting
nighttime hazy images to daytime-equivalent brightness remains largely
unaddressed. Existing methods face two critical limitations: (1) datasets
overlook the brightness relationship between day and night, resulting in the
brightness mapping being inconsistent with the real world during image
synthesis; and (2) models do not explicitly incorporate daytime brightness
knowledge, limiting their ability to reconstruct realistic lighting. To address
these challenges, we introduce the Diffusion-Based Nighttime Dehazing (DiffND)
framework, which excels in both data synthesis and lighting reconstruction. Our
approach starts with a data synthesis pipeline that simulates severe
distortions while enforcing brightness consistency between synthetic and
real-world scenes, providing a strong foundation for learning night-to-day
brightness mapping. Next, we propose a restoration model that integrates a
pre-trained diffusion model guided by a brightness perception network. This
design harnesses the diffusion model's generative ability while adapting it to
nighttime dehazing through brightness-aware optimization. Experiments validate
our dataset's utility and the model's superior performance in joint haze
removal and brightness mapping.

Result: 实验表明，GRC在不依赖复杂模拟或增强的情况下，显著提升了模型在恶劣天气下的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: GRC框架通过几何和反射特征的协作，实现了在恶劣天气条件下的最优性能。

Abstract: Existing LiDAR semantic segmentation models often suffer from decreased
accuracy when exposed to adverse weather conditions. Recent methods addressing
this issue focus on enhancing training data through weather simulation or
universal augmentation techniques. However, few works have studied the negative
impacts caused by the heterogeneous domain shifts in the geometric structure
and reflectance intensity of point clouds. In this paper, we delve into this
challenge and address it with a novel Geometry-Reflectance Collaboration (GRC)
framework that explicitly separates feature extraction for geometry and
reflectance. Specifically, GRC employs a dual-branch architecture designed to
independently process geometric and reflectance features initially, thereby
capitalizing on their distinct characteristic. Then, GRC adopts a robust
multi-level feature collaboration module to suppress redundant and unreliable
information from both branches. Consequently, without complex simulation or
augmentation, our method effectively extracts intrinsic information about the
scene while suppressing interference, thus achieving better robustness and
generalization in adverse weather conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of GRC through comprehensive experiments on challenging benchmarks, showing
that our method outperforms previous approaches and establishes new
state-of-the-art results.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成技术的普及，图像常被多工具迭代编辑，现有检测方法在单阶段编辑中有效，但在复杂迭代编辑中表现不足。

Method: 利用三种生成模型（StyleMapGAN、DiffSwap、FacePartsSwap）构建多阶段编辑数据集，并提出MAT框架，通过识别模型编辑模式解决多阶段编辑问题。

Result: 实验表明，MAT框架在多阶段编辑场景中表现优异，显著优于其他方法。

Conclusion: MAT框架为复杂迭代编辑的模型溯源提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: As generative techniques become increasingly accessible, authentic visuals
are frequently subjected to iterative alterations by various individuals
employing a variety of tools. Currently, to avoid misinformation and ensure
accountability, a lot of research on detection and attribution is emerging.
Although these methods demonstrate promise in single-stage manipulation
scenarios, they fall short when addressing complex real-world iterative
manipulation. In this paper, we are the first, to the best of our knowledge, to
systematically model this real-world challenge and introduce a novel method to
solve it. We define a task called "Modelship Attribution", which aims to trace
the evolution of manipulated images by identifying the generative models
involved and reconstructing the sequence of edits they performed. To
realistically simulate this scenario, we utilize three generative models,
StyleMapGAN, DiffSwap, and FacePartsSwap, that sequentially modify distinct
regions of the same image. This process leads to the creation of the first
modelship dataset, comprising 83,700 images (16,740 images*5). Given that later
edits often overwrite the fingerprints of earlier models, the focus shifts from
extracting blended fingerprints to characterizing each model's distinctive
editing patterns. To tackle this challenge, we introduce the modelship
attribution transformer (MAT), a purpose-built framework designed to
effectively recognize and attribute the contributions of various models within
complex, multi-stage manipulation workflows. Through extensive experiments and
comparative analysis with other related methods, our results, including
comprehensive ablation studies, demonstrate that the proposed approach is a
highly effective solution for modelship attribution.

Abstract: Pre-trained encoders for offline feature extraction followed by multiple
instance learning (MIL) aggregators have become the dominant paradigm in
computational pathology (CPath), benefiting cancer diagnosis and prognosis.
However, performance limitations arise from the absence of encoder fine-tuning
for downstream tasks and disjoint optimization with MIL. While slide-level
supervised end-to-end (E2E) learning is an intuitive solution to this issue, it
faces challenges such as high computational demands and suboptimal results.
These limitations motivate us to revisit E2E learning. We argue that prior work
neglects inherent E2E optimization challenges, leading to performance
disparities compared to traditional two-stage methods. In this paper, we
pioneer the elucidation of optimization challenge caused by sparse-attention
MIL and propose a novel MIL called ABMILX. It mitigates this problem through
global correlation-based attention refinement and multi-head mechanisms. With
the efficient multi-scale random patch sampling strategy, an E2E trained ResNet
with ABMILX surpasses SOTA foundation models under the two-stage paradigm
across multiple challenging benchmarks, while remaining computationally
efficient (<10 RTX3090 hours). We show the potential of E2E learning in CPath

Motivation: 传统基于强度的相似性度量在医学图像配准中可能失效，尤其是在解剖结构不一致的情况下。

Method: 利用预训练的扩散模型提取特征，作为相似性度量指导可变形配准网络。

Result: 在2D多模态（DXA到X射线）和3D单模态（脑提取与非脑提取MRI）配准任务中表现优越。

Conclusion: 扩散模型特征能够有效识别语义对应，提升医学图像配准的准确性。

Abstract: Diffusion models, while trained for image generation, have emerged as
powerful foundational feature extractors for downstream tasks. We find that
off-the-shelf diffusion models, trained exclusively to generate natural RGB
images, can identify semantically meaningful correspondences in medical images.
Building on this observation, we propose to leverage diffusion model features
as a similarity measure to guide deformable image registration networks. We
show that common intensity-based similarity losses often fail in challenging
scenarios, such as when certain anatomies are visible in one image but absent
in another, leading to anatomically inaccurate alignments. In contrast, our
method identifies true semantic correspondences, aligning meaningful structures
while disregarding those not present across images. We demonstrate superior
performance of our approach on two tasks: multimodal 2D registration (DXA to
X-Ray) and monomodal 3D registration (brain-extracted to non-brain-extracted
MRI). Code: https://github.com/uncbiag/dgir

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于生成AI的多模态功能神经影像统一表示框架，用于解决数据获取成本高和模型公平性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态功能神经影像数据获取成本高且可行性受限，同时特定群体的数据不足影响BCI解码模型的公平性。

Method: 通过生成AI将多模态功能神经影像映射到统一表示空间，生成数据以补充受限模态和不足群体的数据。

Result: 实验表明，该框架能生成与真实脑活动一致的数据，提升下游任务性能，并增强模型公平性。

Conclusion: 该框架为降低多模态功能神经影像获取成本和提升BCI解码模型公平性提供了新范式。

Abstract: Multimodal functional neuroimaging enables systematic analysis of brain
mechanisms and provides discriminative representations for brain-computer
interface (BCI) decoding. However, its acquisition is constrained by high costs
and feasibility limitations. Moreover, underrepresentation of specific groups
undermines fairness of BCI decoding model. To address these challenges, we
propose a unified representation framework for multimodal functional
neuroimaging via generative artificial intelligence (AI). By mapping multimodal
functional neuroimaging into a unified representation space, the proposed
framework is capable of generating data for acquisition-constrained modalities
and underrepresented groups. Experiments show that the framework can generate
data consistent with real brain activity patterns, provide insights into brain
mechanisms, and improve performance on downstream tasks. More importantly, it
can enhance model fairness by augmenting data for underrepresented groups.
Overall, the framework offers a new paradigm for decreasing the cost of
acquiring multimodal functional neuroimages and enhancing the fairness of BCI
decoding models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于视频的可见光-红外行人重识别（VVI-ReID）框架VLD，通过语言提示和时空建模解决模态差异问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用语言作为高级语义表示，通过CLIP模型生成跨模态共享的语言提示，以缓解可见光和红外模态间的差异。

Method: VLD框架包含两个核心模块：IMLP（生成模态共享文本提示并对齐视觉特征）和STP（通过时空建模增强提示）。

Result: 在VVI-ReID基准测试中取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: VLD框架通过语言驱动和时空建模有效解决了跨模态行人重识别问题。

Abstract: Video-based Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification (VVI-ReID) aims to
match pedestrian sequences across modalities by extracting modality-invariant
sequence-level features. As a high-level semantic representation, language
provides a consistent description of pedestrian characteristics in both
infrared and visible modalities. Leveraging the Contrastive Language-Image
Pre-training (CLIP) model to generate video-level language prompts and guide
the learning of modality-invariant sequence-level features is theoretically
feasible. However, the challenge of generating and utilizing modality-shared
video-level language prompts to address modality gaps remains a critical
problem. To address this problem, we propose a simple yet powerful framework,
video-level language-driven VVI-ReID (VLD), which consists of two core modules:
invariant-modality language prompting (IMLP) and spatial-temporal prompting
(STP). IMLP employs a joint fine-tuning strategy for the visual encoder and the
prompt learner to effectively generate modality-shared text prompts and align
them with visual features from different modalities in CLIP's multimodal space,
thereby mitigating modality differences. Additionally, STP models
spatiotemporal information through two submodules, the spatial-temporal hub
(STH) and spatial-temporal aggregation (STA), which further enhance IMLP by
incorporating spatiotemporal information into text prompts. The STH aggregates
and diffuses spatiotemporal information into the [CLS] token of each frame
across the vision transformer (ViT) layers, whereas STA introduces dedicated
identity-level loss and specialized multihead attention to ensure that the STH
focuses on identity-relevant spatiotemporal feature aggregation. The VLD
framework achieves state-of-the-art results on two VVI-ReID benchmarks. The
code will be released at https://github.com/Visuang/VLD.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合视觉先验和动态约束的同步扩散框架，用于同时生成手-物体交互（HOI）视频和动作，解决了现有方法对预定义模型和运动数据的依赖问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HOI生成方法依赖预定义3D物体模型和实验室捕获的运动数据，且视频生成方法常牺牲物理合理性。本文旨在结合视觉和动态约束，提升生成效果。

Method: 采用三模态自适应调制对齐特征，结合3D全注意力建模模态间依赖关系，并通过视觉感知的3D交互扩散模型生成显式3D交互序列。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在生成高保真、动态合理的HOI序列上优于现有技术，并在未见过的真实场景中表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 提出的框架无需依赖预定义物体模型或显式姿势指导，显著提升了视频与动作的一致性。

Abstract: Hand-Object Interaction (HOI) generation has significant application
potential. However, current 3D HOI motion generation approaches heavily rely on
predefined 3D object models and lab-captured motion data, limiting
generalization capabilities. Meanwhile, HOI video generation methods prioritize
pixel-level visual fidelity, often sacrificing physical plausibility.
Recognizing that visual appearance and motion patterns share fundamental
physical laws in the real world, we propose a novel framework that combines
visual priors and dynamic constraints within a synchronized diffusion process
to generate the HOI video and motion simultaneously. To integrate the
heterogeneous semantics, appearance, and motion features, our method implements
tri-modal adaptive modulation for feature aligning, coupled with 3D
full-attention for modeling inter- and intra-modal dependencies. Furthermore,
we introduce a vision-aware 3D interaction diffusion model that generates
explicit 3D interaction sequences directly from the synchronized diffusion
outputs, then feeds them back to establish a closed-loop feedback cycle. This
architecture eliminates dependencies on predefined object models or explicit
pose guidance while significantly enhancing video-motion consistency.
Experimental results demonstrate our method's superiority over state-of-the-art
approaches in generating high-fidelity, dynamically plausible HOI sequences,
with notable generalization capabilities in unseen real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Despite the significant impact of visual events on human cognition,
understanding events in videos remains a challenging task for AI due to their
complex structures, semantic hierarchies, and dynamic evolution. To address
this, we propose the task of video event understanding that extracts event
scripts and makes predictions with these scripts from videos. To support this
task, we introduce VidEvent, a large-scale dataset containing over 23,000
well-labeled events, featuring detailed event structures, broad hierarchies,
and logical relations extracted from movie recap videos. The dataset was
created through a meticulous annotation process, ensuring high-quality and
reliable event data. We also provide comprehensive baseline models offering
detailed descriptions of their architecture and performance metrics. These
models serve as benchmarks for future research, facilitating comparisons and

dataset's potential to advance video event understanding and encourages the
exploration of innovative algorithms and models. The dataset and related

TL;DR: ANT提出了一种自适应神经时间感知架构，通过动态调整语义粒度、分类器自由引导调度和时间语义重加权，显著提升了文本到运动生成的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在文本到运动生成中忽略了时间频率需求，导致早期去噪需要结构语义而后期需要局部细节。

Method: ANT包括语义时间自适应模块（STA）、动态分类器自由引导调度（DCFG）和时间语义重加权，以动态调整语义粒度。

Result: ANT显著提升了模型性能，并在StableMoFusion上实现了最先进的语义对齐。

Conclusion: ANT通过时间感知架构有效解决了语义条件的时间频率需求问题，为文本到运动生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: While diffusion models advance text-to-motion generation, their static
semantic conditioning ignores temporal-frequency demands: early denoising
requires structural semantics for motion foundations while later stages need
localized details for text alignment. This mismatch mirrors biological
morphogenesis where developmental phases demand distinct genetic programs.
Inspired by epigenetic regulation governing morphological specialization, we
propose **(ANT)**, an **A**daptive **N**eural **T**emporal-Aware architecture.
ANT orchestrates semantic granularity through: **(i) Semantic Temporally
Adaptive (STA) Module:** Automatically partitions denoising into low-frequency
structural planning and high-frequency refinement via spectral analysis. **(ii)
Dynamic Classifier-Free Guidance scheduling (DCFG):** Adaptively adjusts
conditional to unconditional ratio enhancing efficiency while maintaining
fidelity. **(iii) Temporal-semantic reweighting:** Quantitatively aligns text
influence with phase requirements. Extensive experiments show that ANT can be
applied to various baselines, significantly improving model performance, and
achieving state-of-the-art semantic alignment on StableMoFusion.

TL;DR: 论文提出PAID方法，通过保留预训练权重的成对角度结构，提升持续测试时适应（CTTA）的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CTTA方法主要利用目标数据，忽略了预训练权重中未充分利用的领域不变先验信息。

Method: 分析预训练权重的几何属性（幅度、绝对角度、成对角度结构），提出PAID方法，分解权重为幅度和方向，并通过Householder反射学习正交矩阵以全局旋转方向。

Result: PAID在四个CTTA基准测试中优于现有SOTA方法。

Conclusion: 保留成对角度结构是CTTA中简单有效的原则。

Abstract: Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) aims to online adapt a pre-trained
model to changing environments during inference. Most existing methods focus on
exploiting target data, while overlooking another crucial source of
information, the pre-trained weights, which encode underutilized
domain-invariant priors. This paper takes the geometric attributes of
pre-trained weights as a starting point, systematically analyzing three key
components: magnitude, absolute angle, and pairwise angular structure. We find
that the pairwise angular structure remains stable across diverse corrupted
domains and encodes domain-invariant semantic information, suggesting it should
be preserved during adaptation. Based on this insight, we propose PAID
(Pairwise Angular-Invariant Decomposition), a prior-driven CTTA method that
decomposes weight into magnitude and direction, and introduces a learnable
orthogonal matrix via Householder reflections to globally rotate direction
while preserving the pairwise angular structure. During adaptation, only the
magnitudes and the orthogonal matrices are updated. PAID achieves consistent
improvements over recent SOTA methods on four widely used CTTA benchmarks,
demonstrating that preserving pairwise angular structure offers a simple yet
effective principle for CTTA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在3D室内场景合成中简化对象语义、依赖掩码扩散或忽略房间边界，而基于LLM的方法虽支持丰富语义但不支持编辑。ReSpace旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 采用结构化场景表示和显式房间边界，将场景编辑视为下一个令牌预测任务，结合监督微调和偏好对齐的双阶段训练方法。

Result: 在对象添加任务上超越现有技术，同时在完整场景合成中保持竞争力。

Conclusion: ReSpace通过语言模型和结构化表示，实现了高效的3D场景合成与编辑，填补了现有方法的不足。

Abstract: Scene synthesis and editing has emerged as a promising direction in computer
graphics. Current trained approaches for 3D indoor scenes either oversimplify
object semantics through one-hot class encodings (e.g., 'chair' or 'table'),
require masked diffusion for editing, ignore room boundaries, or rely on floor
plan renderings that fail to capture complex layouts. In contrast, LLM-based
methods enable richer semantics via natural language (e.g., 'modern studio with
light wood furniture') but do not support editing, remain limited to
rectangular layouts or rely on weak spatial reasoning from implicit world
models. We introduce ReSpace, a generative framework for text-driven 3D indoor
scene synthesis and editing using autoregressive language models. Our approach
features a compact structured scene representation with explicit room
boundaries that frames scene editing as a next-token prediction task. We
leverage a dual-stage training approach combining supervised fine-tuning and
preference alignment, enabling a specially trained language model for object
addition that accounts for user instructions, spatial geometry, object
semantics, and scene-level composition. For scene editing, we employ a
zero-shot LLM to handle object removal and prompts for addition. We further
introduce a novel voxelization-based evaluation that captures fine-grained
geometry beyond 3D bounding boxes. Experimental results surpass
state-of-the-art on object addition while maintaining competitive results on
full scene synthesis.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在计算效率和适应性之间取得了平衡，为资源受限场景下的持续测试时自适应目标检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Continual test-time adaptive object detection (CTTA-OD) aims to online adapt
a source pre-trained detector to ever-changing environments during inference
under continuous domain shifts. Most existing CTTA-OD methods prioritize
effectiveness while overlooking computational efficiency, which is crucial for
resource-constrained scenarios. In this paper, we propose an efficient CTTA-OD
method via pruning. Our motivation stems from the observation that not all
learned source features are beneficial; certain domain-sensitive feature
channels can adversely affect target domain performance. Inspired by this, we
introduce a sensitivity-guided channel pruning strategy that quantifies each
channel based on its sensitivity to domain discrepancies at both image and
instance levels. We apply weighted sparsity regularization to selectively
suppress and prune these sensitive channels, focusing adaptation efforts on
invariant ones. Additionally, we introduce a stochastic channel reactivation
mechanism to restore pruned channels, enabling recovery of potentially useful
features and mitigating the risks of early pruning. Extensive experiments on
three benchmarks show that our method achieves superior adaptation performance
while reducing computational overhead by 12% in FLOPs compared to the recent
SOTA method.

Conclusion: 通过连续运动观察，提出了一种生成式感知方法，为物理系统中的视觉推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Perceiving the shape and material of an object from a single image is
inherently ambiguous, especially when lighting is unknown and unconstrained.
Despite this, humans can often disentangle shape and material, and when they
are uncertain, they often move their head slightly or rotate the object to help
resolve the ambiguities. Inspired by this behavior, we introduce a novel
conditional denoising-diffusion model that generates samples of
shape-and-material maps from a short video of an object undergoing differential
motions. Our parameter-efficient architecture allows training directly in
pixel-space, and it generates many disentangled attributes of an object
simultaneously. Trained on a modest number of synthetic object-motion videos
with supervision on shape and material, the model exhibits compelling emergent
behavior: For static observations, it produces diverse, multimodal predictions
of plausible shape-and-material maps that capture the inherent ambiguities; and
when objects move, the distributions quickly converge to more accurate
explanations. The model also produces high-quality shape-and-material estimates
for less ambiguous, real-world objects. By moving beyond single-view to
continuous motion observations, our work suggests a generative perception
approach for improving visual reasoning in physically-embodied systems.

Conclusion: 该框架通过模仿人脑学习机制，显著提升了去雨网络的适应性和性能。

Abstract: Current image de-raining methods primarily learn from a limited dataset,
leading to inadequate performance in varied real-world rainy conditions. To
tackle this, we introduce a new framework that enables networks to
progressively expand their de-raining knowledge base by tapping into a growing
pool of datasets, significantly boosting their adaptability. Drawing
inspiration from the human brain's ability to continuously absorb and
generalize from ongoing experiences, our approach borrow the mechanism of the
complementary learning system. Specifically, we first deploy Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) to capture and retain the unique features of new
data, mirroring the hippocampus's role in learning and memory. Then, the
de-raining network is trained with both existing and GAN-synthesized data,
mimicking the process of hippocampal replay and interleaved learning.
Furthermore, we employ knowledge distillation with the replayed data to
replicate the synergy between the neocortex's activity patterns triggered by
hippocampal replays and the pre-existing neocortical knowledge. This
comprehensive framework empowers the de-raining network to amass knowledge from
various datasets, continually enhancing its performance on previously unseen
rainy scenes. Our testing on three benchmark de-raining networks confirms the
framework's effectiveness. It not only facilitates continuous knowledge
accumulation across six datasets but also surpasses state-of-the-art methods in
generalizing to new real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 扩散模型（DMs）生成高质量图像但计算成本高，现有 NAS 方法受限于重训练需求、搜索复杂性和缓慢评估。

Method: Flexiffusion 将生成过程分解为灵活段，动态组合完整、部分和跳过计算步骤，并引入 rFID 作为轻量级评估指标。

Result: Flexiffusion 在多个模型上实现至少 2 倍加速，FID 退化低于 5%，Stable Diffusion 上达到 5.1 倍加速。

Conclusion: Flexiffusion 为高效搜索高速扩散模型提供了新范式，无需牺牲生成质量。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) are powerful generative models capable of producing
high-fidelity images but are constrained by high computational costs due to
iterative multi-step inference. While Neural Architecture Search (NAS) can
optimize DMs, existing methods are hindered by retraining requirements,
exponential search complexity from step-wise optimization, and slow evaluation
relying on massive image generation. To address these challenges, we propose
Flexiffusion, a training-free NAS framework that jointly optimizes generation
schedules and model architectures without modifying pre-trained parameters. Our
key insight is to decompose the generation process into flexible segments of
equal length, where each segment dynamically combines three step types: full
(complete computation), partial (cache-reused computation), and null (skipped
computation). This segment-wise search space reduces the candidate pool
exponentially compared to step-wise NAS while preserving architectural
diversity. Further, we introduce relative FID (rFID), a lightweight evaluation
metric for NAS that measures divergence from a teacher model's outputs instead
of ground truth, slashing evaluation time by over $90\%$. In practice,
Flexiffusion achieves at least $2\times$ acceleration across LDMs, Stable
Diffusion, and DDPMs on ImageNet and MS-COCO, with FID degradation under $5\%$,
outperforming prior NAS and caching methods. Notably, it attains $5.1\times$
speedup on Stable Diffusion with near-identical CLIP scores. Our work pioneers
a resource-efficient paradigm for searching high-speed DMs without sacrificing
quality.

Conclusion: 通过改进不确定性测量和引入信息量评估，显著提升了半监督图像分割的性能。

Abstract: Although existing semi-supervised image segmentation methods have achieved
good performance, they cannot effectively utilize multiple sources of
voxel-level uncertainty for targeted learning. Therefore, we propose two main
improvements. First, we introduce a novel pignistic co-evidential fusion
strategy using generalized evidential deep learning, extended by traditional
D-S evidence theory, to obtain a more precise uncertainty measure for each
voxel in medical samples. This assists the model in learning mixed labeled
information and establishing semantic associations between labeled and
unlabeled data. Second, we introduce the concept of information volume of mass
function (IVUM) to evaluate the constructed evidence, implementing two
evidential learning schemes. One optimizes evidential deep learning by
combining the information volume of the mass function with original uncertainty
measures. The other integrates the learning pattern based on the co-evidential
fusion strategy, using IVUM to design a new optimization objective. Experiments
on four datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of our method.

Conclusion: ZeroPlane在多领域3D平面重建中表现出高精度和强泛化能力。

Abstract: 3D plane reconstruction from a single image is a crucial yet challenging
topic in 3D computer vision. Previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods have
focused on training their system on a single dataset from either indoor or
outdoor domain, limiting their generalizability across diverse testing data. In
this work, we introduce a novel framework dubbed ZeroPlane, a Transformer-based
model targeting zero-shot 3D plane detection and reconstruction from a single
image, over diverse domains and environments. To enable data-driven models
across multiple domains, we have curated a large-scale planar benchmark,
comprising over 14 datasets and 560,000 high-resolution, dense planar
annotations for diverse indoor and outdoor scenes. To address the challenge of
achieving desirable planar geometry on multi-dataset training, we propose to
disentangle the representation of plane normal and offset, and employ an
exemplar-guided, classification-then-regression paradigm to learn plane and
offset respectively. Additionally, we employ advanced backbones as image

Motivation: 长视频生成在娱乐和模拟等领域有广泛应用，但现有方法在时间一致性和视觉吸引力方面仍面临挑战。

Method: 使用LMTV-DM生成大运动间隔的关键帧，并通过LOF-DM和MotionControlNet分解中间帧插值为运动生成和后处理细化。

Conclusion: LumosFlow在长视频生成中表现出色，代码和模型将公开。

Abstract: Long video generation has gained increasing attention due to its widespread
applications in fields such as entertainment and simulation. Despite advances,
synthesizing temporally coherent and visually compelling long sequences remains
a formidable challenge. Conventional approaches often synthesize long videos by
sequentially generating and concatenating short clips, or generating key frames
and then interpolate the intermediate frames in a hierarchical manner. However,
both of them still remain significant challenges, leading to issues such as
temporal repetition or unnatural transitions. In this paper, we revisit the
hierarchical long video generation pipeline and introduce LumosFlow, a
framework introduce motion guidance explicitly. Specifically, we first employ
the Large Motion Text-to-Video Diffusion Model (LMTV-DM) to generate key frames
with larger motion intervals, thereby ensuring content diversity in the
generated long videos. Given the complexity of interpolating contextual
transitions between key frames, we further decompose the intermediate frame
interpolation into motion generation and post-hoc refinement. For each pair of
key frames, the Latent Optical Flow Diffusion Model (LOF-DM) synthesizes
complex and large-motion optical flows, while MotionControlNet subsequently
refines the warped results to enhance quality and guide intermediate frame
generation. Compared with traditional video frame interpolation, we achieve 15x
interpolation, ensuring reasonable and continuous motion between adjacent
frames. Experiments show that our method can generate long videos with
consistent motion and appearance. Code and models will be made publicly
available upon acceptance. Our project page:

Motivation: 受大语言模型上下文学习机制的启发，现有单参考方法在非刚性变换上表现不佳，因此需要一种能更好捕捉和转移编辑意图的方法。

Method: 提出RelationAdapter轻量模块，利用源-目标图像对提取内容感知编辑意图，并应用于Diffusion Transformer模型。

Result: 在Relation252K数据集上的实验表明，RelationAdapter显著提升了模型对编辑意图的理解和转移能力。

Conclusion: RelationAdapter为视觉提示驱动的图像编辑提供了有效的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Inspired by the in-context learning mechanism of large language models
(LLMs), a new paradigm of generalizable visual prompt-based image editing is
emerging. Existing single-reference methods typically focus on style or
appearance adjustments and struggle with non-rigid transformations. To address
these limitations, we propose leveraging source-target image pairs to extract
and transfer content-aware editing intent to novel query images. To this end,
we introduce RelationAdapter, a lightweight module that enables Diffusion
Transformer (DiT) based models to effectively capture and apply visual
transformations from minimal examples. We also introduce Relation252K, a
comprehensive dataset comprising 218 diverse editing tasks, to evaluate model
generalization and adaptability in visual prompt-driven scenarios. Experiments
on Relation252K show that RelationAdapter significantly improves the model's
ability to understand and transfer editing intent, leading to notable gains in
generation quality and overall editing performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法因依赖高质量标签数据而缺乏泛化能力，限制了大规模应用。本文首次尝试利用不完美标签数据解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了一种兼容任何单目高度估计网络的集成管道，设计了平衡软损失和序数约束的损失函数，以处理噪声标签、域偏移和高度值长尾分布问题。

Conclusion: 通过弱监督和精心设计的损失函数，利用不完美标签数据显著提升了模型的泛化能力和性能。

Abstract: Monocular height estimation is considered the most efficient and
cost-effective means of 3D perception in remote sensing, and it has attracted
much attention since the emergence of deep learning. While training neural
networks requires a large amount of data, data with perfect labels are scarce
and only available within developed regions. The trained models therefore lack
generalizability, which limits the potential for large-scale application of
existing methods. We tackle this problem for the first time, by introducing
data with imperfect labels into training pixel-wise height estimation networks,
including labels that are incomplete, inexact, and inaccurate compared to
high-quality labels. We propose an ensemble-based pipeline compatible with any
monocular height estimation network. Taking the challenges of noisy labels,
domain shift, and long-tailed distribution of height values into consideration,
we carefully design the architecture and loss functions to leverage the
information concealed in imperfect labels using weak supervision through
balanced soft losses and ordinal constraints. We conduct extensive experiments
on two datasets with different resolutions, DFC23 (0.5 to 1 m) and GBH (3 m).
The results indicate that the proposed pipeline outperforms baselines by
achieving more balanced performance across various domains, leading to
improvements of average root mean square errors up to 22.94 %, and 18.62 % on
DFC23 and GBH, respectively. The efficacy of each design component is validated
through ablation studies. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的视频异常检测框架，通过稀疏特征过滤模块和混合专家架构抑制过度泛化，并结合视觉语言模型增强语义理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法因过度泛化难以区分正常与异常事件，且仅依赖低层次特征，无法捕捉高层次语义。

Method: 引入稀疏特征过滤模块（SFFM）动态去除异常信息，设计混合专家（MoE）架构提取多样化特征；结合视觉语言模型（VLM）生成文本描述，实现多模态联合建模。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的多模态联合建模和稀疏特征过滤范式显著提升了视频异常检测性能。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) methods based on reconstruction or prediction
face two critical challenges: (1) strong generalization capability often
results in accurate reconstruction or prediction of abnormal events, making it
difficult to distinguish normal from abnormal patterns; (2) reliance only on
low-level appearance and motion cues limits their ability to identify
high-level semantic in abnormal events from complex scenes. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel VAD framework with two key innovations. First,
to suppress excessive generalization, we introduce the Sparse Feature Filtering
Module (SFFM) that employs bottleneck filters to dynamically and adaptively
remove abnormal information from features. Unlike traditional memory modules,
it does not need to memorize the normal prototypes across the training dataset.
Further, we design the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture for SFFM. Each
expert is responsible for extracting specialized principal features during
running time, and different experts are selectively activated to ensure the
diversity of the learned principal features. Second, to overcome the neglect of
semantics in existing methods, we integrate a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to
generate textual descriptions for video clips, enabling comprehensive joint
modeling of semantic, appearance, and motion cues. Additionally, we enforce
modality consistency through semantic similarity constraints and motion
frame-difference contrastive loss. Extensive experiments on multiple public
datasets validate the effectiveness of our multimodal joint modeling framework
and sparse feature filtering paradigm. Project page at

Result: 实验表明细粒度视觉感知是主要瓶颈，PRS显著提升了MLLMs在AVR任务中的表现。

Conclusion: PRS框架有效解决了MLLMs在抽象视觉推理中的瓶颈，提升了性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Recent strides in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have significantly
advanced their performance in many reasoning tasks. However, Abstract Visual
Reasoning (AVR) remains a critical challenge, primarily due to limitations in
perceiving abstract graphics. To tackle this issue, we investigate the
bottlenecks in current MLLMs and synthesize training data to improve their
abstract visual perception. First, we propose VisuRiddles, a benchmark for AVR,
featuring tasks meticulously constructed to assess models' reasoning capacities
across five core dimensions and two high-level reasoning categories. Second, we
introduce the Perceptual Riddle Synthesizer (PRS), an automated framework for
generating riddles with fine-grained perceptual descriptions. PRS not only
generates valuable training data for abstract graphics but also provides
fine-grained perceptual description, crucially allowing for supervision over
intermediate reasoning stages and thereby improving both training efficacy and
model interpretability. Our extensive experimental results on VisuRiddles
empirically validate that fine-grained visual perception is the principal
bottleneck and our synthesis framework markedly enhances the performance of
contemporary MLLMs on these challenging tasks. Our code and dataset will be
released at https://github.com/yh-hust/VisuRiddles

Result: 在四个数据集和任务中验证了智能采样对性能保持的关键作用。

Conclusion: POLED通过动态事件重要性估计和适应性下采样，显著提升了事件相机的实用性。

Abstract: Event cameras capture scene changes asynchronously on a per-pixel basis,
enabling extremely high temporal resolution. However, this advantage comes at
the cost of high bandwidth, memory, and computational demands. To address this,
prior work has explored event downsampling, but most approaches rely on fixed
heuristics or threshold-based strategies, limiting their adaptability. Instead,
we propose a probabilistic framework, POLED, that models event importance
through an event-importance probability density function (ePDF), which can be
arbitrarily defined and adapted to different applications. Our approach
operates in a purely online setting, estimating event importance on-the-fly
from raw event streams, enabling scene-specific adaptation. Additionally, we
introduce zero-shot event downsampling, where downsampled events must remain
usable for models trained on the original event stream, without task-specific
adaptation. We design a contour-preserving ePDF that prioritizes structurally
important events and evaluate our method across four datasets and tasks--object
classification, image interpolation, surface normal estimation, and object
detection--demonstrating that intelligent sampling is crucial for maintaining
performance under event-budget constraints.

are extracted using a high-performance visual encoder. The features are then
fed into a Transformer to predict verbs and nouns, with a verb-noun
co-occurrence matrix incorporated to enhance recognition accuracy. Finally, the
predicted verb-noun pairs are formatted as textual prompts and input into a

Our framework achieves first place in this challenge at CVPR 2025, establishing

Motivation: 手术智能领域缺乏针对性的视觉语言模型和大规模高质量数据库，现有通用模型无法满足手术视觉感知、时间分析和推理的需求。

Method: 构建了SurgVLM-DB数据库（180万帧图像和779万对话），统一并重组了23个公共数据集，提出基于Qwen2.5-VL的SurgVLM模型，并进行指令调优。

Conclusion: SurgVLM填补了手术智能领域的空白，为多任务手术智能提供了通用解决方案。

Abstract: Foundation models have achieved transformative success across biomedical
domains by enabling holistic understanding of multimodal data. However, their
application in surgery remains underexplored. Surgical intelligence presents
unique challenges - requiring surgical visual perception, temporal analysis,
and reasoning. Existing general-purpose vision-language models fail to address
these needs due to insufficient domain-specific supervision and the lack of a
large-scale high-quality surgical database. To bridge this gap, we propose
SurgVLM, one of the first large vision-language foundation models for surgical
intelligence, where this single universal model can tackle versatile surgical
tasks. To enable this, we construct a large-scale multimodal surgical database,
SurgVLM-DB, comprising over 1.81 million frames with 7.79 million
conversations, spanning more than 16 surgical types and 18 anatomical
structures. We unify and reorganize 23 public datasets across 10 surgical
tasks, followed by standardizing labels and doing hierarchical vision-language
alignment to facilitate comprehensive coverage of gradually finer-grained
surgical tasks, from visual perception, temporal analysis, to high-level
reasoning. Building upon this comprehensive dataset, we propose SurgVLM, which
is built upon Qwen2.5-VL, and undergoes instruction tuning to 10+ surgical
tasks. We further construct a surgical multimodal benchmark, SurgVLM-Bench, for
method evaluation. SurgVLM-Bench consists of 6 popular and widely-used datasets
in surgical domain, covering several crucial downstream tasks. Based on
SurgVLM-Bench, we evaluate the performance of our SurgVLM (3 SurgVLM variants:
SurgVLM-7B, SurgVLM-32B, and SurgVLM-72B), and conduct comprehensive
comparisons with 14 mainstream commercial VLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash,
Qwen2.5-Max).

Conclusion: 通过核方法对齐CLIP与DINOv2，有效提升了视觉编码器的感知能力，同时保持与文本嵌入的兼容性。

Abstract: Vision-language models, such as CLIP, have achieved significant success in
aligning visual and textual representations, becoming essential components of
many multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) like LLaVA and OpenFlamingo.
However, numerous studies have identified CLIP's limited fine-grained
perception as a critical drawback, leading to substantial failures in
downstream MLLMs. In contrast, vision-centric foundation models like DINOv2
demonstrate remarkable capabilities in capturing fine details from images. In
this work, we propose a novel kernel-based method to align CLIP's visual
representation with that of DINOv2, ensuring that the resulting embeddings
maintain compatibility with text embeddings while enhancing perceptual
capabilities. Our alignment objective is designed for efficient stochastic
optimization. Following this image-only alignment fine-tuning, the visual
encoder retains compatibility with the frozen text encoder and exhibits
significant improvements in zero-shot object recognition, fine-grained spatial
reasoning, and localization. By integrating the aligned visual encoder,
downstream MLLMs also demonstrate enhanced performance.

TL;DR: Dual-Conditional Inversion (DCI) 是一种新的扩散模型反演框架，通过联合条件优化解决重建精度与编辑灵活性之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型反演方法在重建精度和编辑灵活性之间存在固有权衡，难以同时保持语义对齐和结构一致性。

Method: DCI 将反演过程建模为双条件固定点优化问题，联合源提示和参考图像指导，最小化潜在噪声差距和重建误差。

Result: DCI 在多个编辑任务中达到最先进性能，显著提高重建质量和编辑精度，同时在重建任务中也表现优异。

Conclusion: DCI 通过双条件优化实现了更准确和可编辑的潜在表示，为反演过程提供了新的理解。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation and
editing tasks. Inversion within these models aims to recover the latent noise
representation for a real or generated image, enabling reconstruction, editing,
and other downstream tasks. However, to date, most inversion approaches suffer
from an intrinsic trade-off between reconstruction accuracy and editing
flexibility. This limitation arises from the difficulty of maintaining both
semantic alignment and structural consistency during the inversion process. In
this work, we introduce Dual-Conditional Inversion (DCI), a novel framework
that jointly conditions on the source prompt and reference image to guide the
inversion process. Specifically, DCI formulates the inversion process as a
dual-condition fixed-point optimization problem, minimizing both the latent
noise gap and the reconstruction error under the joint guidance. This design
anchors the inversion trajectory in both semantic and visual space, leading to
more accurate and editable latent representations. Our novel setup brings new
understanding to the inversion process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
DCI achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple editing tasks,
significantly improving both reconstruction quality and editing precision.
Furthermore, we also demonstrate that our method achieves strong results in
reconstruction tasks, implying a degree of robustness and generalizability
approaching the ultimate goal of the inversion process.

Method: 使用Transformer编码器和对比三元组损失学习固定维度的轨迹嵌入，分析Cosine和FFT相似性度量在对比学习中的作用。

Result: Cosine相似性目标在语义和方向属性上表现更优，低维嵌入（如16维）在检索性能和计算开销间取得平衡。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种紧凑、语义明确且高效的轨迹表示，为实时系统中的运动预测提供了透明且可控的解决方案。

Abstract: The ability to retrieve semantically and directionally similar short-range
trajectories with both accuracy and efficiency is foundational for downstream
applications such as motion forecasting and autonomous navigation. However,
prevailing approaches often depend on computationally intensive heuristics or
latent anchor representations that lack interpretability and controllability.
In this work, we propose a novel framework for learning fixed-dimensional
embeddings for short trajectories by leveraging a Transformer encoder trained
with a contrastive triplet loss that emphasize the importance of discriminative
feature spaces for trajectory data. We analyze the influence of Cosine and
FFT-based similarity metrics within the contrastive learning paradigm, with a
focus on capturing the nuanced directional intent that characterizes short-term
maneuvers. Our empirical evaluation on the Argoverse 2 dataset demonstrates
that embeddings shaped by Cosine similarity objectives yield superior
clustering of trajectories by both semantic and directional attributes,
outperforming FFT-based baselines in retrieval tasks. Notably, we show that
compact Transformer architectures, even with low-dimensional embeddings (e.g.,
16 dimensions, but qualitatively down to 4), achieve a compelling balance
between retrieval performance (minADE, minFDE) and computational overhead,
aligning with the growing demand for scalable and interpretable motion priors
in real-time systems. The resulting embeddings provide a compact, semantically
meaningful, and efficient representation of trajectory data, offering a robust
alternative to heuristic similarity measures and paving the way for more
transparent and controllable motion forecasting pipelines.

Abstract: Accurate LiDAR-camera calibration is fundamental to fusing multi-modal
perception in autonomous driving and robotic systems. Traditional calibration
methods require extensive data collection in controlled environments and cannot
compensate for the transformation changes during the vehicle/robot movement. In
this paper, we propose the first model that uses bird's-eye view (BEV) features
to perform LiDAR camera calibration from raw data, termed BEVCALIB. To achieve
this, we extract camera BEV features and LiDAR BEV features separately and fuse
them into a shared BEV feature space. To fully utilize the geometric
information from the BEV feature, we introduce a novel feature selector to
filter the most important features in the transformation decoder, which reduces
memory consumption and enables efficient training. Extensive evaluations on
KITTI, NuScenes, and our own dataset demonstrate that BEVCALIB establishes a
new state of the art. Under various noise conditions, BEVCALIB outperforms the
best baseline in the literature by an average of (47.08%, 82.32%) on KITTI
dataset, and (78.17%, 68.29%) on NuScenes dataset, in terms of (translation,
rotation), respectively. In the open-source domain, it improves the best

Conclusion: VPD-SR通过语义和感知优化，实现了高效且高质量的单步超分辨率生成。

Abstract: Diffusion-based models have been widely used in various visual generation
tasks, showing promising results in image super-resolution (SR), while
typically being limited by dozens or even hundreds of sampling steps. Although
existing methods aim to accelerate the inference speed of multi-step
diffusion-based SR methods through knowledge distillation, their generated
images exhibit insufficient semantic alignment with real images, resulting in
suboptimal perceptual quality reconstruction, specifically reflected in the
CLIPIQA score. These methods still have many challenges in perceptual quality
and semantic fidelity. Based on the challenges, we propose VPD-SR, a novel
visual perception diffusion distillation framework specifically designed for
SR, aiming to construct an effective and efficient one-step SR model.
Specifically, VPD-SR consists of two components: Explicit Semantic-aware
Supervision (ESS) and High-Frequency Perception (HFP) loss. Firstly, the ESS
leverages the powerful visual perceptual understanding capabilities of the CLIP
model to extract explicit semantic supervision, thereby enhancing semantic
consistency. Then, Considering that high-frequency information contributes to
the visual perception quality of images, in addition to the vanilla
distillation loss, the HFP loss guides the student model to restore the missing
high-frequency details in degraded images that are critical for enhancing
perceptual quality. Lastly, we expand VPD-SR in adversarial training manner to
further enhance the authenticity of the generated content. Extensive
experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the
proposed VPD-SR achieves superior performance compared to both previous
state-of-the-art methods and the teacher model with just one-step sampling.

based on traditional signal processing, which cannot effectively process the
complex background and dense space debris. In this paper, we propose a deep
learning-based Space Debris Tracking Network~(SDT-Net) to achieve highly
accurate debris tracking. SDT-Net effectively represents the feature of debris,
enhancing the efficiency and stability of end-to-end model learning. To train
and evaluate this model effectively, we also produce a large-scale dataset
Space Debris Tracking Dataset (SDTD) by a novel observation-based data
simulation scheme. SDTD contains 18,040 video sequences with a total of 62,562
frames and covers 250,000 synthetic space debris. Extensive experiments
validate the effectiveness of our model and the challenging of our dataset.
Furthermore, we test our model on real data from the Antarctic Station,
achieving a MOTA score of 70.6%, which demonstrates its strong transferability
to real-world scenarios. Our dataset and code will be released soon.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于自动驾驶场景理解的分层问答方法，通过动态问题树和紧凑视觉语言模型实现高效且详细的视觉解释。

Result: 在自定义数据集上表现优异，与GPT-4o等先进方法竞争，同时显著降低推理时间。

Conclusion: 该方法能够高效捕获关键驾驶元素，适用于实时部署。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a hierarchical question-answering (QA) approach for
scene understanding in autonomous vehicles, balancing cost-efficiency with
detailed visual interpretation. The method fine-tunes a compact vision-language
model (VLM) on a custom dataset specific to the geographical area in which the
vehicle operates to capture key driving-related visual elements. At the
inference stage, the hierarchical QA strategy decomposes the scene
understanding task into high-level and detailed sub-questions. Instead of
generating lengthy descriptions, the VLM navigates a structured question tree,
where answering high-level questions (e.g., "Is it possible for the ego vehicle
to turn left at the intersection?") triggers more detailed sub-questions (e.g.,
"Is there a vehicle approaching the intersection from the opposite
direction?"). To optimize inference time, questions are dynamically skipped
based on previous answers, minimizing computational overhead. The extracted
answers are then synthesized using handcrafted templates to ensure coherent,
contextually accurate scene descriptions. We evaluate the proposed approach on
the custom dataset using GPT reference-free scoring, demonstrating its
competitiveness with state-of-the-art methods like GPT-4o in capturing key
scene details while achieving significantly lower inference time. Moreover,
qualitative results from real-time deployment highlight the proposed approach's
capacity to capture key driving elements with minimal latency.

Conclusion: ControlMambaIR在图像恢复任务中具有灵活性和高效性，Mamba架构作为条件控制网络表现优异。

Abstract: This paper proposes ControlMambaIR, a novel image restoration method designed
to address perceptual challenges in image deraining, deblurring, and denoising
tasks. By integrating the Mamba network architecture with the diffusion model,
the condition network achieves refined conditional control, thereby enhancing
the control and optimization of the image generation process. To evaluate the
robustness and generalization capability of our method across various image
degradation conditions, extensive experiments were conducted on several
benchmark datasets, including Rain100H, Rain100L, GoPro, and SSID. The results
demonstrate that our proposed approach consistently surpasses existing methods
in perceptual quality metrics, such as LPIPS and FID, while maintaining
comparable performance in image distortion metrics, including PSNR and SSIM,
highlighting its effectiveness and adaptability. Notably, ablation experiments
reveal that directly noise prediction in the diffusion process achieves better
performance, effectively balancing noise suppression and detail preservation.
Furthermore, the findings indicate that the Mamba architecture is particularly
well-suited as a conditional control network for diffusion models,
outperforming both CNN- and Attention-based approaches in this context.
Overall, these results highlight the flexibility and effectiveness of
ControlMambaIR in addressing a range of image restoration perceptual
challenges.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时自适应方法计算成本高且扩展性差，主要由于样本级自适应和依赖昂贵辅助设计。

Method: SAIL结合冻结预训练VLM和AdaptNet，通过置信度插值权重生成预测，并利用梯度漂移指示器动态重置AdaptNet。

Result: SAIL在多样化基准测试中表现优异，计算成本低，适用于实际部署。

Conclusion: SAIL高效、可扩展且性能优越，为测试时自适应提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) has emerged as a critical technique for enhancing
the generalization capability of vision-language models (VLMs) during
inference. However, existing approaches often incur substantial computational
costs and exhibit poor scalability, primarily due to sample-wise adaptation
granularity and reliance on costly auxiliary designs such as data augmentation.
To address these limitations, we introduce SAIL (Small Aid, Big Leap), a novel
adapter-based TTA framework that leverages a lightweight, learnable AdaptNet to
enable efficient and scalable model adaptation. As SAIL's core, a frozen
pre-trained VLM collaborates with AdaptNet through a confidence-based
interpolation weight, generating robust predictions during inference. These
predictions serve as self-supervised targets to align AdaptNet's outputs
through efficient batch-wise processing, dramatically reducing computational
costs without modifying the VLM or requiring memory caches. To mitigate
catastrophic forgetting during continual adaptation, we propose a
gradient-aware reset strategy driven by a gradient drift indicator (GDI), which
dynamically detects domain transitions and strategically resets AdaptNet for
stable adaptation. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks on two
scenarios demonstrate that SAIL achieves state-of-the-art performance while
maintaining low computational costs. These results highlight SAIL's
effectiveness, efficiency and scalability for real-world deployment. The code
will be released upon acceptance.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在1-shot和5-shot设置下分别比现有最佳方法平均准确率提高了1.92%和1.88%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了特征纠缠问题，提升了跨域少样本分割的性能。

Abstract: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation (CD-FSS) aims to transfer knowledge from a
source-domain dataset to unseen target-domain datasets with limited
annotations. Current methods typically compare the distance between training
and testing samples for mask prediction. However, we find an entanglement
problem exists in this widely adopted method, which tends to bind sourcedomain
patterns together and make each of them hard to transfer. In this paper, we aim
to address this problem for the CD-FSS task. We first find a natural
decomposition of the ViT structure, based on which we delve into the
entanglement problem for an interpretation. We find the decomposed ViT
components are crossly compared between images in distance calculation, where
the rational comparisons are entangled with those meaningless ones by their
equal importance, leading to the entanglement problem. Based on this
interpretation, we further propose to address the entanglement problem by
learning to weigh for all comparisons of ViT components, which learn
disentangled features and re-compose them for the CD-FSS task, benefiting both
the generalization and finetuning. Experiments show that our model outperforms
the state-of-the-art CD-FSS method by 1.92% and 1.88% in average accuracy under
1-shot and 5-shot settings, respectively.

Result: 在包含13个视频级数据集的综合基准测试中，SurgVISTA表现优于自然和手术领域的预训练模型。

Conclusion: SurgVISTA在临床场景中展现出推动智能手术系统发展的潜力。

Abstract: Computer-Assisted Intervention (CAI) has the potential to revolutionize
modern surgery, with surgical scene understanding serving as a critical
component in supporting decision-making, improving procedural efficacy, and
ensuring intraoperative safety. While existing AI-driven approaches alleviate
annotation burdens via self-supervised spatial representation learning, their
lack of explicit temporal modeling during pre-training fundamentally restricts
the capture of dynamic surgical contexts, resulting in incomplete
spatiotemporal understanding. In this work, we introduce the first video-level
surgical pre-training framework that enables joint spatiotemporal
representation learning from large-scale surgical video data. To achieve this,
we constructed a large-scale surgical video dataset comprising 3,650 videos and
approximately 3.55 million frames, spanning more than 20 surgical procedures
and over 10 anatomical structures. Building upon this dataset, we propose
SurgVISTA (Surgical Video-level Spatial-Temporal Architecture), a
reconstruction-based pre-training method that captures intricate spatial
structures and temporal dynamics through joint spatiotemporal modeling.
Additionally, SurgVISTA incorporates image-level knowledge distillation guided
by a surgery-specific expert to enhance the learning of fine-grained anatomical
and semantic features. To validate its effectiveness, we established a
comprehensive benchmark comprising 13 video-level datasets spanning six
surgical procedures across four tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SurgVISTA consistently outperforms both natural- and surgical-domain
pre-trained models, demonstrating strong potential to advance intelligent
surgical systems in clinically meaningful scenarios.

TL;DR: FaceSleuth是一种双流架构，通过垂直注意力机制和动态学习方向提升微表情识别性能，在多个基准测试中达到新SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微表情识别需要放大毫秒级、低幅度的面部运动，同时抑制身份特征。

Method: 提出FaceSleuth，包含垂直注意力块（CVA）、面部位置聚焦器和动作单元嵌入，并引入动态学习方向的SOA模块。

Result: 在CASME II、SAMM和MMEW上分别达到95.1%、87.1%和92.9%的准确率，验证了垂直方向的优越性。

Conclusion: FaceSleuth为微表情识别提供了新SOTA，并首次证明垂直注意力方向最具判别力。

Abstract: Micro-expression recognition (MER) demands models that can amplify
millisecond-level, low-amplitude facial motions while suppressing
identity-specific appearance. We introduce FaceSleuth, a dual-stream
architecture that (1) enhances motion along the empirically dominant vertical
axix through a Continuously Vertical Attention (CVA) block, (2) localises the
resulting signals with a Facial Position Focalizer built on hierarchical
cross-window attention, and (3) steers feature learning toward physiologically
meaningful regions via lightweight Action-Unit embeddings. To examine whether
the hand-chosen vertical axis is indeed optimal, we further propose a
Single-Orientation Attention (SOA) module that learns its own pooling direction
end-to-end. SOA is differentiable, adds only 0.16 % parameters, and collapses
to CVA when the learned angle converges to {\Pi}/2. In practice, SOA reliably
drifts to 88{\deg}, confirming the effectiveness of the vertical prior while
delivering consistent gains. On three standard MER benchmarks, FaceSleuth with
CVA already surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods; plugging in SOA lifts
accuracy and F1 score performance to 95.1 % / 0.918 on CASME II, 87.1 % / 0.840
on SAMM, and 92.9 % / 0.917 on MMEW without sacrificing model compactness.
These results establish a new state of the art and, for the first time, provide
empirical evidence that the vertical attention bias is the most discriminative
orientation for MER.

Result: 实验表明，该方法能生成高质量且符合给定条件的布局，优于现有最优模型。

Conclusion: 提出的检索和参考引导方法有效提升了布局生成的质量和条件满足度。

Abstract: Controllable layout generation aims to create plausible visual arrangements
of element bounding boxes within a graphic design according to certain optional
constraints, such as the type or position of a specific component. While recent
diffusion or flow-matching models have achieved considerable advances in
multifarious conditional generation tasks, there remains considerable room for
generating optimal arrangements under given conditions. In this work, we
propose to carry out layout generation through retrieving by conditions and
reference-guided generation. Specifically, we retrieve appropriate layout
templates according to given conditions as references. The references are then
utilized to guide the denoising or flow-based transport process. By retrieving
layouts compatible with the given conditions, we can uncover the potential
information not explicitly provided in the given condition. Such an approach
offers more effective guidance to the model during the generation process, in
contrast to previous models that feed the condition to the model and let the
model infer the unprovided layout attributes directly. Meanwhile, we design a
condition-modulated attention that selectively absorbs retrieval knowledge,
adapting to the difference between retrieved templates and given conditions.
Extensive experiment results show that our method successfully produces
high-quality layouts that meet the given conditions and outperforms existing
state-of-the-art models. Code will be released upon acceptance.

Result: SmPO-Diffusion在偏好评估中表现最优，训练成本更低。

Conclusion: SmPO-Diffusion通过简单修改有效解决了现有方法的过优化和目标不对齐问题。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) aligns text-to-image (T2I) generation
models with human preferences using pairwise preference data. Although
substantial resources are expended in collecting and labeling datasets, a
critical aspect is often neglected: \textit{preferences vary across individuals
and should be represented with more granularity.} To address this, we propose
SmPO-Diffusion, a novel method for modeling preference distributions to improve
the DPO objective, along with a numerical upper bound estimation for the
diffusion optimization objective. First, we introduce a smoothed preference
distribution to replace the original binary distribution. We employ a reward
model to simulate human preferences and apply preference likelihood averaging
to improve the DPO loss, such that the loss function approaches zero when
preferences are similar. Furthermore, we utilize an inversion technique to
simulate the trajectory preference distribution of the diffusion model,
enabling more accurate alignment with the optimization objective. Our approach
effectively mitigates issues of excessive optimization and objective
misalignment present in existing methods through straightforward modifications.
Our SmPO-Diffusion achieves state-of-the-art performance in preference
evaluation, outperforming baselines across metrics with lower training costs.

Motivation: 牙科形状数据集通常稀疏，且传统方法对网格连接性有严格要求，限制了模型的灵活性和应用范围。

Conclusion: ToothForge结合光谱分析和机器学习，为牙科及其他医学领域的形状分析提供了灵活且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce ToothForge, a spectral approach for automatically generating
novel 3D teeth, effectively addressing the sparsity of dental shape datasets.
By operating in the spectral domain, our method enables compact machine
learning modeling, allowing the generation of high-resolution tooth meshes in
milliseconds. However, generating shape spectra comes with the instability of
the decomposed harmonics. To address this, we propose modeling the latent
manifold on synchronized frequential embeddings. Spectra of all data samples
are aligned to a common basis prior to the training procedure, effectively
eliminating biases introduced by the decomposition instability. Furthermore,
synchronized modeling removes the limiting factor imposed by previous methods,
which require all shapes to share a common fixed connectivity. Using a private
dataset of real dental crowns, we observe a greater reconstruction quality of
the synthetized shapes, exceeding those of models trained on unaligned
embeddings. We also explore additional applications of spectral analysis in
digital dentistry, such as shape compression and interpolation. ToothForge
facilitates a range of approaches at the intersection of spectral analysis and
machine learning, with fewer restrictions on mesh structure. This makes it
applicable for shape analysis not only in dentistry, but also in broader
medical applications, where guaranteeing consistent connectivity across shapes
from various clinics is unrealistic. The code is available at

method for creating a dataset designed to improve alignment between predicted
scores and their textual justifications. By iteratively training the model with
Direct Preference Optimization on two distinct datasets and merging them, we
can improve both scoring accuracy and the coherence of generated explanations.

Conclusion: GeneA-SLAM2为动态场景提供了一种高效且精确的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing semantic SLAM in dynamic environments mainly identify dynamic
regions through object detection or semantic segmentation methods. However, in
certain highly dynamic scenarios, the detection boxes or segmentation masks
cannot fully cover dynamic regions. Therefore, this paper proposes a robust and
efficient GeneA-SLAM2 system that leverages depth variance constraints to
handle dynamic scenes. Our method extracts dynamic pixels via depth variance
and creates precise depth masks to guide the removal of dynamic objects.
Simultaneously, an autoencoder is used to reconstruct keypoints, improving the
genetic resampling keypoint algorithm to obtain more uniformly distributed
keypoints and enhance the accuracy of pose estimation. Our system was evaluated
on multiple highly dynamic sequences. The results demonstrate that GeneA-SLAM2
maintains high accuracy in dynamic scenes compared to current methods. Code is

Abstract: Compound figures, which are multi-panel composites containing diverse

### [88] [VTGaussian-SLAM: RGBD SLAM for Large Scale Scenes with Splatting View-Tied 3D Gaussians](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02741)
*Pengchong Hu,Zhizhong Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视图绑定的3D高斯表示方法（view-tied 3D Gaussians），用于RGBD SLAM系统，解决了现有方法在超大场景中效率低下的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用3D高斯表示场景，但在超大场景中由于GPU内存限制和优化需求，无法高效跟踪和建图。

Method: 提出视图绑定的3D高斯表示，简化高斯参数（无需学习位置、旋转和多维方差），并设计新的跟踪和建图策略。

Result: 在渲染质量、跟踪精度和可扩展性上优于最新方法，显著节省存储并支持更多高斯表示局部细节。

Conclusion: 视图绑定的3D高斯表示和策略设计有效提升了RGBD SLAM的性能和可扩展性。

Abstract: Jointly estimating camera poses and mapping scenes from RGBD images is a
fundamental task in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM).
State-of-the-art methods employ 3D Gaussians to represent a scene, and render
these Gaussians through splatting for higher efficiency and better rendering.
However, these methods cannot scale up to extremely large scenes, due to the
inefficient tracking and mapping strategies that need to optimize all 3D
Gaussians in the limited GPU memories throughout the training to maintain the
geometry and color consistency to previous RGBD observations. To resolve this
issue, we propose novel tracking and mapping strategies to work with a novel 3D
representation, dubbed view-tied 3D Gaussians, for RGBD SLAM systems. View-tied
3D Gaussians is a kind of simplified Gaussians, which is tied to depth pixels,
without needing to learn locations, rotations, and multi-dimensional variances.
Tying Gaussians to views not only significantly saves storage but also allows
us to employ many more Gaussians to represent local details in the limited GPU
memory. Moreover, our strategies remove the need of maintaining all Gaussians
learnable throughout the training, while improving rendering quality, and
tracking accuracy. We justify the effectiveness of these designs, and report
better performance over the latest methods on the widely used benchmarks in
terms of rendering and tracking accuracy and scalability. Please see our

TL;DR: RobustSplat通过延迟高斯增长和尺度级联掩码引导，解决了3D高斯溅射中瞬态物体导致的渲染伪影问题。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在建模受瞬态物体影响的场景时存在伪影问题，高斯密度化过程加剧了这一问题。

Method: 提出延迟高斯增长策略和尺度级联掩码引导方法，优化静态场景结构并精确预测瞬态掩码。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法，验证了方法的鲁棒性和有效性。

Conclusion: RobustSplat有效解决了瞬态物体导致的伪影问题，提升了渲染质量。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained significant attention for its
real-time, photo-realistic rendering in novel-view synthesis and 3D modeling.
However, existing methods struggle with accurately modeling scenes affected by
transient objects, leading to artifacts in the rendered images. We identify
that the Gaussian densification process, while enhancing scene detail capture,
unintentionally contributes to these artifacts by growing additional Gaussians
that model transient disturbances. To address this, we propose RobustSplat, a
robust solution based on two critical designs. First, we introduce a delayed
Gaussian growth strategy that prioritizes optimizing static scene structure
before allowing Gaussian splitting/cloning, mitigating overfitting to transient
objects in early optimization. Second, we design a scale-cascaded mask
bootstrapping approach that first leverages lower-resolution feature similarity
supervision for reliable initial transient mask estimation, taking advantage of
its stronger semantic consistency and robustness to noise, and then progresses
to high-resolution supervision to achieve more precise mask prediction.
Extensive experiments on multiple challenging datasets show that our method
outperforms existing methods, clearly demonstrating the robustness and
effectiveness of our method. Our project page is

Result: 自由观看训练的模型可迁移到视觉搜索任务，性能仅下降3.86%（SemSS指标），计算成本降低92.29%（GFLOPs）和31.23%（参数）。

Conclusion: 自由观看和任务驱动视觉搜索可以共享共同表示，显著降低计算成本且性能损失小。

Abstract: Computational human attention modeling in free-viewing and task-specific
settings is often studied separately, with limited exploration of whether a
common representation exists between them. This work investigates this question
and proposes a neural network architecture that builds upon the Human Attention
transformer (HAT) to test the hypothesis. Our results demonstrate that
free-viewing and visual search can efficiently share a common representation,
allowing a model trained in free-viewing attention to transfer its knowledge to
task-driven visual search with a performance drop of only 3.86% in the
predicted fixation scanpaths, measured by the semantic sequence score (SemSS)
metric which reflects the similarity between predicted and human scanpaths.
This transfer reduces computational costs by 92.29% in terms of GFLOPs and
31.23% in terms of trainable parameters.

Conclusion: DTNet通过动态权重和注意力机制有效提升了车辆检测的适应性。

Abstract: Stable consumer electronic systems can assist traffic better. Good traffic
consumer electronic systems require collaborative work between traffic
algorithms and hardware. However, performance of popular traffic algorithms
containing vehicle detection methods based on deep networks via learning data
relation rather than learning differences in different lighting and occlusions
is limited. In this paper, we present a dynamic Transformer network for vehicle
detection (DTNet). DTNet utilizes a dynamic convolution to guide a deep network
to dynamically generate weights to enhance adaptability of an obtained
detector. Taking into relations of different information account, a mixed
attention mechanism based channel attention and Transformer is exploited to
strengthen relations of channels and pixels to extract more salient information
for vehicle detection. To overcome the drawback of difference in an image
account, a translation-variant convolution relies on spatial location
information to refine obtained structural information for vehicle detection.
Experimental results illustrate that our DTNet is competitive for vehicle
detection. Code of the proposed DTNet can be obtained at

Abstract: Controllability plays a crucial role in the practical applications of 3D
indoor scene synthesis. Existing works either allow rough language-based
control, that is convenient but lacks fine-grained scene customization, or
employ graph based control, which offers better controllability but demands
considerable knowledge for the cumbersome graph design process. To address
these challenges, we present FreeScene, a user-friendly framework that enables
both convenient and effective control for indoor scene synthesis.Specifically,
FreeScene supports free-form user inputs including text description and/or
reference images, allowing users to express versatile design intentions. The
user inputs are adequately analyzed and integrated into a graph representation
by a VLM-based Graph Designer. We then propose MG-DiT, a Mixed Graph Diffusion
Transformer, which performs graph-aware denoising to enhance scene generation.
Our MG-DiT not only excels at preserving graph structure but also offers broad
applicability to various tasks, including, but not limited to, text-to-scene,
graph-to-scene, and rearrangement, all within a single model. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that FreeScene provides an efficient and user-friendly
solution that unifies text-based and graph based scene synthesis, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods in terms of both generation quality and
controllability in a range of applications.

Result: 与专家测量相比，平均误差0.04，均方偏差0.054，组内相关系数0.782。

Conclusion: 该方法准确性高，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Objective. Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) is recognized as a biomarker
of secondary brain injury, with a significant linear correlation observed
between optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) and ICP. Frequent monitoring of ONSD
could effectively support dynamic evaluation of ICP. However, ONSD measurement
is heavily reliant on the operator's experience and skill, particularly in
manually selecting the optimal frame from ultrasound sequences and measuring
ONSD. Approach. This paper presents a novel method to automatically identify
the optimal frame from video sequences for ONSD measurement by employing the
Kernel Correlation Filter (KCF) tracking algorithm and Simple Linear Iterative
Clustering (SLIC) segmentation algorithm. The optic nerve sheath is mapped and
measured using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) combined with a
KL-divergence-based method. Results. When compared with the average
measurements of two expert clinicians, the proposed method achieved a mean
error, mean squared deviation, and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of
0.04, 0.054, and 0.782, respectively. Significance. The findings suggest that
this method provides highly accurate automated ONSD measurements, showing
potential for clinical application.

Abstract: Cross-domain few-shot learning (CDFSL) aims to transfer knowledge from a
data-sufficient source domain to data-scarce target domains. Although Vision
Transformer (ViT) has shown superior capability in many vision tasks, its
transferability against huge domain gaps in CDFSL is still under-explored. In
this paper, we find an intriguing phenomenon: during the source-domain
training, prompt tuning, as a common way to train ViT, could be harmful for the
generalization of ViT in target domains, but setting them to random noises
(i.e., random registers) could consistently improve target-domain performance.
We then delve into this phenomenon for an interpretation. We find that
learnable prompts capture domain information during the training on the source
dataset, which views irrelevant visual patterns as vital cues for recognition.
This can be viewed as a kind of overfitting and increases the sharpness of the
loss landscapes. In contrast, random registers are essentially a novel way of
perturbing attention for the sharpness-aware minimization, which helps the
model find a flattened minimum in loss landscapes, increasing the
transferability. Based on this phenomenon and interpretation, we further
propose a simple but effective approach for CDFSL to enhance the perturbation
on attention maps by adding random registers on the semantic regions of image
tokens, improving the effectiveness and efficiency of random registers.
Extensive experiments on four benchmarks validate our rationale and
state-of-the-art performance. Codes and models are available at

Conclusion: PBR-SR在PBR和渲染评估中表现优异，适用于高级应用如重新光照。

Abstract: We present PBR-SR, a novel method for physically based rendering (PBR)
texture super resolution (SR). It outputs high-resolution, high-quality PBR
textures from low-resolution (LR) PBR input in a zero-shot manner. PBR-SR
leverages an off-the-shelf super-resolution model trained on natural images,
and iteratively minimizes the deviations between super-resolution priors and
differentiable renderings. These enhancements are then back-projected into the
PBR map space in a differentiable manner to produce refined, high-resolution
textures. To mitigate view inconsistencies and lighting sensitivity, which is
common in view-based super-resolution, our method applies 2D prior constraints
across multi-view renderings, iteratively refining the shared, upscaled
textures. In parallel, we incorporate identity constraints directly in the PBR
texture domain to ensure the upscaled textures remain faithful to the LR input.
PBR-SR operates without any additional training or data requirements, relying
entirely on pretrained image priors. We demonstrate that our approach produces
high-fidelity PBR textures for both artist-designed and AI-generated meshes,
outperforming both direct SR models application and prior texture optimization
methods. Our results show high-quality outputs in both PBR and rendering
evaluations, supporting advanced applications such as relighting.

Conclusion: METok为长视频处理提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) have significantly
enhanced their ability to understand video content. Nonetheless, processing
long videos remains challenging due to high computational demands and the
redundancy present in the visual data. In this work, we propose METok, a
training-free, Multi-stage Event-based Token compression framework designed to
accelerate VLLMs' inference while preserving accuracy. METok progressively
eliminates redundant visual tokens across three critical stages: (1)
event-aware compression during vision encoding, (2) hierarchical token pruning
in the prefilling stage based on semantic alignment and event importance, and
(3) a decoding-stage KV Cache optimization that further reduces memory
consumption. Our experiments on diverse video benchmarks demonstrate that METok
achieves an optimal trade-off between efficiency and accuracy by dynamically
selecting informative visual tokens. For instance, equipping LongVA-7B with
METok realizes an 80.6% FLOPs reduction and 93.5% KV Cache memory savings, all
while maintaining comparable or even superior accuracy.

Conclusion: PGFormer通过金字塔结构有效捕捉长距离依赖关系，为3D人体姿态估计提供了一种轻量级多尺度解决方案。

Abstract: Action coordination in human structure is indispensable for the spatial
constraints of 2D joints to recover 3D pose. Usually, action coordination is
represented as a long-range dependence among body parts. However, there are two
main challenges in modeling long-range dependencies. First, joints should not
only be constrained by other individual joints but also be modulated by the
body parts. Second, existing methods make networks deeper to learn dependencies
between non-linked parts. They introduce uncorrelated noise and increase the
model size. In this paper, we utilize a pyramid structure to better learn
potential long-range dependencies. It can capture the correlation across joints
and groups, which complements the context of the human sub-structure. In an
effective cross-scale way, it captures the pyramid-structured long-range
dependence. Specifically, we propose a novel Pyramid Graph Attention (PGA)
module to capture long-range cross-scale dependencies. It concatenates
information from various scales into a compact sequence, and then computes the
correlation between scales in parallel. Combining PGA with graph convolution
modules, we develop a Pyramid Graph Transformer (PGFormer) for 3D human pose
estimation, which is a lightweight multi-scale transformer architecture. It
encapsulates human sub-structures into self-attention by pooling. Extensive
experiments show that our approach achieves lower error and smaller model size
than state-of-the-art methods on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets. The code
is available at https://github.com/MingjieWe/PGFormer.

Result: 在经典分割任务（如息肉和皮肤病变分割）中表现优异，泛化能力强，性能提升达14.04%。

Conclusion: 抽象提示比位置提示包含更丰富的语义信息，增强了模型的鲁棒性和泛化性能。

Abstract: Although the Segment Anything Model (SAM) is highly effective in natural
image segmentation, it requires dependencies on prompts, which limits its
applicability to medical imaging where manual prompts are often unavailable.
Existing efforts to fine-tune SAM for medical segmentation typically struggle
to remove this dependency. We propose Hierarchical Self-Prompting SAM
(HSP-SAM), a novel self-prompting framework that enables SAM to achieve strong
performance in prompt-free medical image segmentation. Unlike previous
self-prompting methods that remain limited to positional prompts similar to
vanilla SAM, we are the first to introduce learning abstract prompts during the
self-prompting process. This simple and intuitive self-prompting framework
achieves superior performance on classic segmentation tasks such as polyp and
skin lesion segmentation, while maintaining robustness across diverse medical
imaging modalities. Furthermore, it exhibits strong generalization to unseen
datasets, achieving improvements of up to 14.04% over previous state-of-the-art
methods on some challenging benchmarks. These results suggest that abstract
prompts encapsulate richer and higher-dimensional semantic information compared
to positional prompts, thereby enhancing the model's robustness and
generalization performance. All models and codes will be released upon
acceptance.

Abstract: Detecting deepfakes has become a critical challenge in Computer Vision and
Artificial Intelligence. Despite significant progress in detection techniques,
generalizing them to open-set scenarios continues to be a persistent
difficulty. Neural networks are often trained on the closed-world assumption,
but with new generative models constantly evolving, it is inevitable to
encounter data generated by models that are not part of the training
distribution. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose two novel
Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) detection approaches. The first approach is trained
to reconstruct the input image, while the second incorporates an attention
mechanism for detecting OODs. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of the
proposed approaches compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques. Our
method achieves promising results in deepfake detection and ranks among the
top-performing configurations on the benchmark, demonstrating their potential
for robust, adaptable solutions in dynamic, real-world applications.

Abstract: Visual Object Tracking (VOT) is a fundamental task with widespread
applications in autonomous navigation, surveillance, and maritime robotics.
Despite significant advances in generic object tracking, maritime environments
continue to present unique challenges, including specular water reflections,
low-contrast targets, dynamically changing backgrounds, and frequent
occlusions. These complexities significantly degrade the performance of
state-of-the-art tracking algorithms, highlighting the need for domain-specific
datasets. To address this gap, we introduce the Maritime Visual Tracking
Dataset (MVTD), a comprehensive and publicly available benchmark specifically
designed for maritime VOT. MVTD comprises 182 high-resolution video sequences,
totaling approximately 150,000 frames, and includes four representative object
classes: boat, ship, sailboat, and unmanned surface vehicle (USV). The dataset
captures a diverse range of operational conditions and maritime scenarios,
reflecting the real-world complexities of maritime environments. We evaluated
14 recent SOTA tracking algorithms on the MVTD benchmark and observed
substantial performance degradation compared to their performance on
general-purpose datasets. However, when fine-tuned on MVTD, these models
demonstrate significant performance gains, underscoring the effectiveness of
domain adaptation and the importance of transfer learning in specialized

TL;DR: 论文探讨了使用Vision Transformers（ViTs）结合地理空间位置嵌入来改进北极地区高分辨率遥感任务中的特征检测，优于传统CNN方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 北极地区永久冻土地貌、融化扰动和人类基础设施的精确测绘需求日益增长，但现有CNN方法在长距离依赖和全局上下文捕捉上存在局限。

Method: 采用预训练的ViTs作为特征提取器，结合图像和位置嵌入，提升模型在北极特征检测中的泛化能力。

Result: ViTs结合位置嵌入在三个任务中的两个表现优于CNN，如RTS检测的F1分数从0.84提升至0.92。

Conclusion: 研究表明，具有空间感知能力的Transformer模型在北极遥感应用中具有潜力。

Abstract: Accurate mapping of permafrost landforms, thaw disturbances, and human-built
infrastructure at pan-Arctic scale using sub-meter satellite imagery is
increasingly critical. Handling petabyte-scale image data requires
high-performance computing and robust feature detection models. While
convolutional neural network (CNN)-based deep learning approaches are widely
used for remote sensing (RS),similar to the success in transformer based large
language models, Vision Transformers (ViTs) offer advantages in capturing
long-range dependencies and global context via attention mechanisms. ViTs
support pretraining via self-supervised learning-addressing the common
limitation of labeled data in Arctic feature detection and outperform CNNs on
benchmark datasets. Arctic also poses challenges for model generalization,
especially when features with the same semantic class exhibit diverse spectral
characteristics. To address these issues for Arctic feature detection, we
integrate geospatial location embeddings into ViTs to improve adaptation across
regions. This work investigates: (1) the suitability of pre-trained ViTs as
feature extractors for high-resolution Arctic remote sensing tasks, and (2) the
benefit of combining image and location embeddings. Using previously published
datasets for Arctic feature detection, we evaluate our models on three
tasks-detecting ice-wedge polygons (IWP), retrogressive thaw slumps (RTS), and
human-built infrastructure. We empirically explore multiple configurations to
fuse image embeddings and location embeddings. Results show that ViTs with
location embeddings outperform prior CNN-based models on two of the three tasks
including F1 score increase from 0.84 to 0.92 for RTS detection, demonstrating
the potential of transformer-based models with spatial awareness for Arctic RS
applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为GaRA的轻量级适配器方法，用于提升Segment Anything Model (SAM)在输入退化情况下的鲁棒性，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险应用（如自动驾驶和机器人）中，提升SAM对输入退化的鲁棒性至关重要。

Method: 采用gated-rank adaptation (GaRA)，在冻结的SAM中间层引入轻量级适配器，动态调整权重矩阵的有效秩。

Result: GaRA-SAM在所有鲁棒分割基准测试中显著优于先前工作，在ACDC数据集上IoU得分提升高达21.3%。

Conclusion: GaRA方法在不牺牲SAM泛化能力的前提下，实现了细粒度且输入感知的鲁棒化。

Abstract: Improving robustness of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to input
degradations is critical for its deployment in high-stakes applications such as
autonomous driving and robotics. Our approach to this challenge prioritizes
three key aspects: first, parameter efficiency to maintain the inherent
generalization capability of SAM; second, fine-grained and input-aware
robustification to precisely address the input corruption; and third, adherence
to standard training protocols for ease of training. To this end, we propose
gated-rank adaptation (GaRA). GaRA introduces lightweight adapters into
intermediate layers of the frozen SAM, where each adapter dynamically adjusts
the effective rank of its weight matrix based on the input by selectively
activating (rank-1) components of the matrix using a learned gating module.
This adjustment enables fine-grained and input-aware robustification without
compromising the generalization capability of SAM. Our model, GaRA-SAM,
significantly outperforms prior work on all robust segmentation benchmarks. In
particular, it surpasses the previous best IoU score by up to 21.3\%p on ACDC,
a challenging real corrupted image dataset.

*Jonathan Astermark,Anders Heyden,Viktor Larsson*

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效的匹配摘要方案，显著加速了密集匹配下的鲁棒两视图相对位姿估计，同时保持与完整密集匹配相当的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 密集匹配虽然提高了位姿估计的准确性和鲁棒性，但在RANSAC中的鲁棒估计阶段会显著增加运行时间。

Method: 提出了一种高效的匹配摘要方案，以减少密集匹配的数量，同时保持精度。

Result: 在标准基准数据集上验证，该方法比完整密集匹配快10-100倍，且精度相当。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持精度的同时显著提升了运行效率，适用于密集匹配场景。

Abstract: In this paper, we speed up robust two-view relative pose from dense
correspondences. Previous work has shown that dense matchers can significantly
improve both accuracy and robustness in the resulting pose. However, the large
number of matches comes with a significantly increased runtime during robust
estimation in RANSAC. To avoid this, we propose an efficient match
summarization scheme which provides comparable accuracy to using the full set
of dense matches, while having 10-100x faster runtime. We validate our approach
on standard benchmark datasets together with multiple state-of-the-art dense
matchers.

Motivation: 研究VLMs在真实、复杂环境中的表现，验证其是否具备主动探索能力。

Method: 引入FlySearch（3D户外真实环境），定义三种难度场景，测试VLMs表现，并分析失败原因。

Result: 现有VLMs在简单任务中表现不可靠，与人类差距随任务难度增加而扩大；部分问题可通过微调解决。

Conclusion: VLMs在复杂探索任务中仍有局限性，需进一步改进；公开了测试平台和代码。

Abstract: The real world is messy and unstructured. Uncovering critical information
often requires active, goal-driven exploration. It remains to be seen whether
Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which recently emerged as a popular zero-shot
tool in many difficult tasks, can operate effectively in such conditions. In
this paper, we answer this question by introducing FlySearch, a 3D, outdoor,
photorealistic environment for searching and navigating to objects in complex
scenes. We define three sets of scenarios with varying difficulty and observe
that state-of-the-art VLMs cannot reliably solve even the simplest exploration
tasks, with the gap to human performance increasing as the tasks get harder. We
identify a set of central causes, ranging from vision hallucination, through
context misunderstanding, to task planning failures, and we show that some of
them can be addressed by finetuning. We publicly release the benchmark,
scenarios, and the underlying codebase.

TL;DR: 论文提出了AnnoGuide基准，旨在通过专家定义的标注指南自动标注数据，减少人工标注需求。以nuScenes数据集为例，结合基础模型（FMs）实现多模态少样本3D检测，性能显著提升。


<details>

Motivation: 数据标注是机器学习应用中的关键但耗时耗力的环节，研究如何通过自动化方法直接从标注指南生成标注，减少人工成本。

Method: 利用开源基础模型进行RGB图像目标检测与分割，将2D检测投影到3D空间，并通过聚类LiDAR点生成3D标注。逐步优化关键组件提升性能。

Result: 3D检测mAP从12.1提升至21.9，表明方法有效但仍具挑战性，需进一步发展LiDAR基础模型。

Conclusion: AnnoGuide为自动化数据标注提供了新基准，展示了基础模型的潜力，但问题仍具挑战性，需进一步研究。

Abstract: A crucial yet under-appreciated prerequisite in machine learning solutions
for real-applications is data annotation: human annotators are hired to
manually label data according to detailed, expert-crafted guidelines. This is
often a laborious, tedious, and costly process. To study methods for
facilitating data annotation, we introduce a new benchmark AnnoGuide:
Auto-Annotation from Annotation Guidelines. It aims to evaluate automated
methods for data annotation directly from expert-defined annotation guidelines,
eliminating the need for manual labeling. As a case study, we repurpose the
well-established nuScenes dataset, commonly used in autonomous driving
research, which provides comprehensive annotation guidelines for labeling LiDAR
point clouds with 3D cuboids across 18 object classes. These guidelines include
a few visual examples and textual descriptions, but no labeled 3D cuboids in
LiDAR data, making this a novel task of multi-modal few-shot 3D detection
without 3D annotations. The advances of powerful foundation models (FMs) make
AnnoGuide especially timely, as FMs offer promising tools to tackle its
challenges. We employ a conceptually straightforward pipeline that (1) utilizes
open-source FMs for object detection and segmentation in RGB images, (2)
projects 2D detections into 3D using known camera poses, and (3) clusters LiDAR
points within the frustum of each 2D detection to generate a 3D cuboid.
Starting with a non-learned solution that leverages off-the-shelf FMs, we
progressively refine key components and achieve significant performance
improvements, boosting 3D detection mAP from 12.1 to 21.9! Nevertheless, our
results highlight that AnnoGuide remains an open and challenging problem,
underscoring the urgent need for developing LiDAR-based FMs. We release our
code and models at GitHub: https://annoguide.github.io/annoguide3Dbenchmark

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MIND算法提出了一种直接从无符号距离场（UDFs）生成材料界面的方法，支持非流形网格提取，解决了现有方法在拓扑结构和非流形几何上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法从UDFs提取网格时存在拓扑伪影和非流形几何无法表示的问题，MIND旨在解决这些挑战。

Method: 通过计算双符号局部场和多标签全局场，结合UDFs构建材料界面，支持多标签Marching Cubes算法提取非流形网格。

Result: 实验表明，MIND能稳健处理复杂非流形表面，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MIND为从UDFs提取非流形网格提供了一种全局视角的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Unsigned distance fields (UDFs) are widely used in 3D deep learning due to
their ability to represent shapes with arbitrary topology. While prior work has
largely focused on learning UDFs from point clouds or multi-view images,
extracting meshes from UDFs remains challenging, as the learned fields rarely
attain exact zero distances. A common workaround is to reconstruct signed
distance fields (SDFs) locally from UDFs to enable surface extraction via
Marching Cubes. However, this often introduces topological artifacts such as
holes or spurious components. Moreover, local SDFs are inherently incapable of
representing non-manifold geometry, leading to complete failure in such cases.
To address this gap, we propose MIND (Material Interface from Non-manifold
Distance fields), a novel algorithm for generating material interfaces directly
from UDFs, enabling non-manifold mesh extraction from a global perspective. The
core of our method lies in deriving a meaningful spatial partitioning from the
UDF, where the target surface emerges as the interface between distinct
regions. We begin by computing a two-signed local field to distinguish the two
sides of manifold patches, and then extend this to a multi-labeled global field
capable of separating all sides of a non-manifold structure. By combining this
multi-labeled field with the input UDF, we construct material interfaces that
support non-manifold mesh extraction via a multi-labeled Marching Cubes
algorithm. Extensive experiments on UDFs generated from diverse data sources,
including point cloud reconstruction, multi-view reconstruction, and medial
axis transforms, demonstrate that our approach robustly handles complex
non-manifold surfaces and significantly outperforms existing methods.

Result: 在多数据集实验中，FORLA在对象发现上优于集中式基线，并学习到紧凑的通用表示。

Conclusion: 联邦槽注意力是分布式概念跨域数据中可扩展无监督视觉表示学习的有效工具。

Abstract: Learning efficient visual representations across heterogeneous unlabeled
datasets remains a central challenge in federated learning. Effective federated
representations require features that are jointly informative across clients
while disentangling domain-specific factors without supervision. We introduce
FORLA, a novel framework for federated object-centric representation learning
and feature adaptation across clients using unsupervised slot attention. At the
core of our method is a shared feature adapter, trained collaboratively across
clients to adapt features from foundation models, and a shared slot attention
module that learns to reconstruct the adapted features. To optimize this
adapter, we design a two-branch student-teacher architecture. In each client, a
student decoder learns to reconstruct full features from foundation models,
while a teacher decoder reconstructs their adapted, low-dimensional
counterpart. The shared slot attention module bridges cross-domain learning by
aligning object-level representations across clients. Experiments in multiple
real-world datasets show that our framework not only outperforms centralized
baselines on object discovery but also learns a compact, universal
representation that generalizes well across domains. This work highlights
federated slot attention as an effective tool for scalable, unsupervised visual
representation learning from cross-domain data with distributed concepts.

Conclusion: MARIO挑战赛为AMD监测设定了基准，显示AI在部分任务中表现优异，但在预测未来演变方面仍需改进。

Abstract: The MARIO challenge, held at MICCAI 2024, focused on advancing the automated
detection and monitoring of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) through the
analysis of optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. Designed to evaluate
algorithmic performance in detecting neovascular activity changes within AMD,
the challenge incorporated unique multi-modal datasets. The primary dataset,
sourced from Brest, France, was used by participating teams to train and test
their models. The final ranking was determined based on performance on this
dataset. An auxiliary dataset from Algeria was used post-challenge to evaluate
population and device shifts from submitted solutions. Two tasks were involved
in the MARIO challenge. The first one was the classification of evolution
between two consecutive 2D OCT B-scans. The second one was the prediction of
future AMD evolution over three months for patients undergoing anti-vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy. Thirty-five teams participated, with
the top 12 finalists presenting their methods. This paper outlines the
challenge's structure, tasks, data characteristics, and winning methodologies,
setting a benchmark for AMD monitoring using OCT, infrared imaging, and
clinical data (such as the number of visits, age, gender, etc.). The results of
this challenge indicate that artificial intelligence (AI) performs as well as a
physician in measuring AMD progression (Task 1) but is not yet able of
predicting future evolution (Task 2).

Conclusion: 多模态大模型在深度伪造检测中具有潜力，DFBench和MoA-DF为相关研究提供了重要工具。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative models, the realism of AI-generated
images has significantly improved, posing critical challenges for verifying
digital content authenticity. Current deepfake detection methods often depend
on datasets with limited generation models and content diversity that fail to
keep pace with the evolving complexity and increasing realism of the
AI-generated content. Large multimodal models (LMMs), widely adopted in various
vision tasks, have demonstrated strong zero-shot capabilities, yet their
potential in deepfake detection remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap,
we present \textbf{DFBench}, a large-scale DeepFake Benchmark featuring (i)
broad diversity, including 540,000 images across real, AI-edited, and
AI-generated content, (ii) latest model, the fake images are generated by 12
state-of-the-art generation models, and (iii) bidirectional benchmarking and
evaluating for both the detection accuracy of deepfake detectors and the
evasion capability of generative models. Based on DFBench, we propose
\textbf{MoA-DF}, Mixture of Agents for DeepFake detection, leveraging a
combined probability strategy from multiple LMMs. MoA-DF achieves
state-of-the-art performance, further proving the effectiveness of leveraging
LMMs for deepfake detection. Database and codes are publicly available at

TL;DR: 论文提出Sparse-vDiT框架，通过利用vDiT中的稀疏注意力模式优化计算，显著减少推理延迟，同时保持视频生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频生成任务中，扩散变换器（DiTs）的注意力机制二次复杂度导致高推理延迟，限制了长序列生成能力。

Method: 1）识别vDiT中的三种稀疏注意力模式；2）提出模式优化的稀疏核和离线稀疏扩散搜索算法；3）融合共享策略的注意力头。

Result: 在多个vDiT模型中实现显著FLOP减少和推理加速（最高2.38倍），同时PSNR值保持高水平。

Conclusion: 研究表明vDiT中的结构稀疏性可被系统利用，为长视频合成提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: While Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved breakthroughs in video
generation, this long sequence generation task remains constrained by the
quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms, resulting in significant
inference latency. Through detailed analysis of attention maps in Video
Diffusion Transformer (vDiT), we identify three recurring sparsity patterns:
diagonal, multi-diagonal, and vertical-stripe structures. And even 3-6\%
attention heads can be skipped. Crucially, these patterns exhibit strong
layer-depth and head-position correlations but show limited dependence on the
input content. Leveraging these findings, we propose Sparse-vDiT, a sparsity
acceleration framework for vDiT comprising: 1) Pattern-optimized sparse kernels
that replace dense attention with computationally efficient implementations for
each identified sparsity pattern. 2) An offline sparse diffusion search
algorithm that selects the optimal sparse computation strategy per layer and
head via hardware-aware cost modeling. After determining the optimal
configuration, we fuse heads within the same layer that share the same
attention strategy, enhancing inference efficiency. Integrated into
state-of-the-art vDiT models (CogVideoX1.5, HunyuanVideo, and Wan2.1),
Sparse-vDiT achieves 2.09$\times$, 2.38$\times$, and 1.67$\times$ theoretical
FLOP reduction, and actual inference speedups of 1.76$\times$, 1.85$\times$,
and 1.58$\times$, respectively, while maintaining high visual fidelity, with
PSNR values reaching 24.13, 27.09, and 22.59. Our work demonstrates that latent
structural sparsity in vDiTs can be systematically exploited for long video
synthesis.

Conclusion: \sys技术在提示反转任务中表现出色，并展示了在跨概念图像合成、概念操作等任务中的应用潜力。

Abstract: Text-to-image generation models~(e.g., Stable Diffusion) have achieved
significant advancements, enabling the creation of high-quality and realistic
images based on textual descriptions. Prompt inversion, the task of identifying
the textual prompt used to generate a specific artifact, holds significant
potential for applications including data attribution, model provenance, and
watermarking validation. Recent studies introduced a delayed projection scheme
to optimize for prompts representative of the vocabulary space, though
challenges in semantic fluency and efficiency remain. Advanced image captioning
models or visual large language models can generate highly interpretable
prompts, but they often lack in image similarity. In this paper, we propose a
prompt inversion technique called \sys for text-to-image diffusion models,
which includes initializing embeddings using a pre-trained image captioning
model, refining them through reverse-engineering in the latent space, and
converting them to texts using an embedding-to-text model. Our experiments on
the widely-used datasets, such as MS COCO, LAION, and Flickr, show that our
method outperforms existing methods in terms of image similarity, textual
alignment, prompt interpretability and generalizability. We further illustrate
the application of our generated prompts in tasks such as cross-concept image
synthesis, concept manipulation, evolutionary multi-concept generation and
unsupervised segmentation.

Conclusion: LEG-SLAM无需预先数据准备，适用于自主机器人、增强现实等领域，是实时语义3D SLAM的重要进展。

Abstract: Modern Gaussian Splatting methods have proven highly effective for real-time
photorealistic rendering of 3D scenes. However, integrating semantic
information into this representation remains a significant challenge,
especially in maintaining real-time performance for SLAM (Simultaneous
Localization and Mapping) applications. In this work, we introduce LEG-SLAM --
a novel approach that fuses an optimized Gaussian Splatting implementation with
visual-language feature extraction using DINOv2 followed by a learnable feature
compressor based on Principal Component Analysis, while enabling an online
dense SLAM. Our method simultaneously generates high-quality photorealistic
images and semantically labeled scene maps, achieving real-time scene
reconstruction with more than 10 fps on the Replica dataset and 18 fps on
ScanNet. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction speed while achieving competitive
rendering quality. The proposed system eliminates the need for prior data
preparation such as camera's ego motion or pre-computed static semantic maps.
With its potential applications in autonomous robotics, augmented reality, and
other interactive domains, LEG-SLAM represents a significant step forward in
real-time semantic 3D Gaussian-based SLAM. Project page:

Conclusion: ORV通过占据中心表示实现了仿真数据到真实感视频的无缝转换，适用于下游机器人学习任务。

Abstract: Acquiring real-world robotic simulation data through teleoperation is
notoriously time-consuming and labor-intensive. Recently, action-driven
generative models have gained widespread adoption in robot learning and
simulation, as they eliminate safety concerns and reduce maintenance efforts.
However, the action sequences used in these methods often result in limited
control precision and poor generalization due to their globally coarse
alignment. To address these limitations, we propose ORV, an Occupancy-centric
Robot Video generation framework, which utilizes 4D semantic occupancy
sequences as a fine-grained representation to provide more accurate semantic
and geometric guidance for video generation. By leveraging occupancy-based
representations, ORV enables seamless translation of simulation data into
photorealistic robot videos, while ensuring high temporal consistency and
precise controllability. Furthermore, our framework supports the simultaneous
generation of multi-view videos of robot gripping operations - an important
capability for downstream robotic learning tasks. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that ORV consistently outperforms existing baseline methods
across various datasets and sub-tasks. Demo, Code and Model:

Conclusion: SG2VID为手术模拟提供了高真实感和可控性，能提升下游任务性能，并展示了对罕见手术场景的生成能力。

Abstract: Surgical simulation plays a pivotal role in training novice surgeons,
accelerating their learning curve and reducing intra-operative errors. However,
conventional simulation tools fall short in providing the necessary
photorealism and the variability of human anatomy. In response, current methods
are shifting towards generative model-based simulators. Yet, these approaches
primarily focus on using increasingly complex conditioning for precise
synthesis while neglecting the fine-grained human control aspect. To address
this gap, we introduce SG2VID, the first diffusion-based video model that
leverages Scene Graphs for both precise video synthesis and fine-grained human
control. We demonstrate SG2VID's capabilities across three public datasets
featuring cataract and cholecystectomy surgery. While SG2VID outperforms
previous methods both qualitatively and quantitatively, it also enables precise
synthesis, providing accurate control over tool and anatomy's size and
movement, entrance of new tools, as well as the overall scene layout. We
qualitatively motivate how SG2VID can be used for generative augmentation and
present an experiment demonstrating its ability to improve a downstream phase
detection task when the training set is extended with our synthetic videos.
Finally, to showcase SG2VID's ability to retain human control, we interact with
the Scene Graphs to generate new video samples depicting major yet rare
intra-operative irregularities.

Abstract: Human-human interaction generation has garnered significant attention in
motion synthesis due to its vital role in understanding humans as social
beings. However, existing methods typically rely on transformer-based
architectures, which often face challenges related to scalability and
efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a novel, efficient human-human
interaction generation method based on the Mamba framework, designed to meet
the demands of effectively capturing long-sequence dependencies while providing
real-time feedback. Specifically, we introduce an adaptive spatio-temporal
Mamba framework that utilizes two parallel SSM branches with an adaptive
mechanism to integrate the spatial and temporal features of motion sequences.
To further enhance the model's ability to capture dependencies within
individual motion sequences and the interactions between different individual
sequences, we develop two key modules: the self-adaptive spatio-temporal Mamba
module and the cross-adaptive spatio-temporal Mamba module, enabling efficient
feature learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art results on two interaction datasets with remarkable quality
and efficiency. Compared to the baseline method InterGen, our approach not only
improves accuracy but also requires a minimal parameter size of just 66M ,only
36% of InterGen's, while achieving an average inference speed of 0.57 seconds,
which is 46% of InterGen's execution time.

Motivation: 解决CNN在视觉扰动和域外图像中的脆弱性问题，通过模仿生物视觉系统提升模型鲁棒性。

Method: 引入EVNets，结合VOneBlock和SubcorticalBlock，优化与生物视觉系统的对齐性。

Result: EVNets在V1对齐性和鲁棒性基准测试中表现优于基础CNN，提升8.5%，结合数据增强后进一步提升7.3%。

Conclusion: EVNets展示了架构改进与数据增强的互补性，为提升CNN鲁棒性提供了新方向。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on object recognition achieve
high task performance but continue to exhibit vulnerability under a range of
visual perturbations and out-of-domain images, when compared with biological
vision. Prior work has demonstrated that coupling a standard CNN with a
front-end block (VOneBlock) that mimics the primate primary visual cortex (V1)
can improve overall model robustness. Expanding on this, we introduce Early
Vision Networks (EVNets), a new class of hybrid CNNs that combine the VOneBlock
with a novel SubcorticalBlock, whose architecture draws from computational
models in neuroscience and is parameterized to maximize alignment with
subcortical responses reported across multiple experimental studies. Without
being optimized to do so, the assembly of the SubcorticalBlock with the
VOneBlock improved V1 alignment across most standard V1 benchmarks, and better
modeled extra-classical receptive field phenomena. In addition, EVNets exhibit
stronger emergent shape bias and overperform the base CNN architecture by 8.5%
on an aggregate benchmark of robustness evaluations, including adversarial
perturbations, common corruptions, and domain shifts. Finally, we show that
EVNets can be further improved when paired with a state-of-the-art data
augmentation technique, surpassing the performance of the isolated data
augmentation approach by 7.3% on our robustness benchmark. This result reveals
complementary benefits between changes in architecture to better mimic biology
and training-based machine learning approaches.

TL;DR: FuseLIP提出了一种新的多模态嵌入架构，通过单一Transformer模型处理文本和图像标记，实现早期融合，提升多模态任务表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对比语言-图像预训练方法无法原生处理多模态输入，需额外模块融合特征，限制了性能。

Method: 利用离散图像标记器，设计单一Transformer模型处理扩展的文本和图像标记词汇，实现早期融合。

Result: FuseLIP在多模态任务（如VQA和文本引导图像转换检索）中表现优于其他方法，单模态任务表现与基线相当。

Conclusion: FuseLIP通过早期融合策略显著提升多模态表示能力，为多模态嵌入提供了新思路。

Abstract: Contrastive language-image pre-training aligns the features of text-image
pairs in a common latent space via distinct encoders for each modality. While
this approach achieves impressive performance in several zero-shot tasks, it
cannot natively handle multimodal inputs, i.e., encoding image and text into a
single feature vector. As a remedy, it is common practice to use additional
modules to merge the features extracted by the unimodal encoders. In this work,
we present FuseLIP, an alternative architecture for multimodal embedding.
Leveraging recent progress in discrete image tokenizers, we propose to use a
single transformer model which operates on an extended vocabulary of text and
image tokens. This early fusion approach allows the different modalities to
interact at each depth of encoding and obtain richer representations compared
to common late fusion. We collect new datasets for multimodal pre-training and
evaluation, designing challenging tasks for multimodal encoder models. We show
that FuseLIP outperforms other approaches in multimodal embedding tasks such as
VQA and text-guided image transformation retrieval, while being comparable to
baselines on unimodal tasks.

Conclusion: EgoVLM通过显式生成推理轨迹提升可解释性，适用于下游应用，关键帧奖励为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Emerging embodied AI applications, such as wearable cameras and autonomous
agents, have underscored the need for robust reasoning from first person video
streams. We introduce EgoVLM, a vision-language model specifically designed to
integrate visual comprehension and spatial-temporal reasoning within egocentric
video contexts. EgoVLM is fine-tuned via Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO), a reinforcement learning method adapted to align model outputs with
human-like reasoning steps. Following DeepSeek R1-Zero's approach, we directly
tune using RL without any supervised fine-tuning phase on chain-of-thought
(CoT) data. We evaluate EgoVLM on egocentric video question answering
benchmarks and show that domain-specific training substantially improves
performance over general-purpose VLMs. Our EgoVLM-3B, trained exclusively on
non-CoT egocentric data, outperforms the base Qwen2.5-VL 3B and 7B models by
14.33 and 13.87 accuracy points on the EgoSchema benchmark, respectively. By
explicitly generating reasoning traces, EgoVLM enhances interpretability,
making it well-suited for downstream applications. Furthermore, we introduce a
novel keyframe-based reward that incorporates salient frame selection to guide
reinforcement learning optimization. This reward formulation opens a promising
avenue for future exploration in temporally grounded egocentric reasoning.

Motivation: 动态手-物体接触重建在AI动画、XR和机器人技术中至关重要，但现有技术因遮挡和复杂表面细节难以实现高精度捕捉。

Method: DyTact采用动态的2D高斯面片表示，结合MANO网格的归纳偏置，通过优化模块和自适应采样策略处理高频变形和遮挡。

Result: 实验表明，DyTact在动态接触估计精度和新视角合成质量上达到最优，同时优化速度快且内存高效。

Conclusion: DyTact为非侵入式动态接触捕捉提供了高效解决方案，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic hand-object contacts is essential for realistic
manipulation in AI character animation, XR, and robotics, yet it remains
challenging due to heavy occlusions, complex surface details, and limitations
in existing capture techniques. In this paper, we introduce DyTact, a
markerless capture method for accurately capturing dynamic contact in
hand-object manipulations in a non-intrusive manner. Our approach leverages a
dynamic, articulated representation based on 2D Gaussian surfels to model
complex manipulations. By binding these surfels to MANO meshes, DyTact
harnesses the inductive bias of template models to stabilize and accelerate
optimization. A refinement module addresses time-dependent high-frequency
deformations, while a contact-guided adaptive sampling strategy selectively
increases surfel density in contact regions to handle heavy occlusion.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DyTact not only achieves
state-of-the-art dynamic contact estimation accuracy but also significantly
improves novel view synthesis quality, all while operating with fast
optimization and efficient memory usage. Project Page:

using motion-guided data generation, layered compositing techniques, and
automated captioning to ensure diversity, realism, and semantic coherence. We
further conduct a comprehensive evaluation of recent instruction-based image
editing methods from both academic and commercial domains.

Result: 实验表明该方法能有效减小域差距并超越现有技术。

Conclusion: 图像标记连续性的破坏有助于ViT在跨域任务中的泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision Transformer (ViT) has achieved remarkable success due to its
large-scale pretraining on general domains, but it still faces challenges when
applying it to downstream distant domains that have only scarce training data,
which gives rise to the Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning (CDFSL) task. Inspired
by Self-Attention's insensitivity to token orders, we find an interesting
phenomenon neglected in current works: disrupting the continuity of image
tokens (i.e., making pixels not smoothly transited across patches) in ViT leads
to a noticeable performance decline in the general (source) domain but only a
marginal decrease in downstream target domains. This questions the role of
image tokens' continuity in ViT's generalization under large domain gaps. In
this paper, we delve into this phenomenon for an interpretation. We find
continuity aids ViT in learning larger spatial patterns, which are harder to
transfer than smaller ones, enlarging domain distances. Meanwhile, it implies
that only smaller patterns within each patch could be transferred under extreme
domain gaps. Based on this interpretation, we further propose a simple yet
effective method for CDFSL that better disrupts the continuity of image tokens,
encouraging the model to rely less on large patterns and more on smaller ones.
Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our method in reducing domain
gaps and outperforming state-of-the-art works. Codes and models are available

Abstract: Large-scale delineation of individual trees from remote sensing imagery is
crucial to the advancement of ecological research, particularly as climate
change and other environmental factors rapidly transform forest landscapes
across the world. Current RGB tree segmentation methods rely on training
specialized machine learning models with labeled tree datasets. While these
learning-based approaches can outperform manual data collection when accurate,
the existing models still depend on training data that's hard to scale. In this
paper, we investigate the efficacy of using a state-of-the-art image
segmentation model, Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2), in a zero-shot manner for
individual tree detection and segmentation. We evaluate a pretrained SAM2 model
on two tasks in this domain: (1) zero-shot segmentation and (2) zero-shot
transfer by using predictions from an existing tree detection model as prompts.
Our results suggest that SAM2 not only has impressive generalization
capabilities, but also can form a natural synergy with specialized methods
trained on in-domain labeled data. We find that applying large pretrained
models to problems in remote sensing is a promising avenue for future progress.

Motivation: 基础模型（如CLIP）在零样本任务中表现优异，但可能从互联网数据中继承有害知识。现有遗忘方法无法精细处理特定知识遗忘，且依赖预训练数据。

Method: 提出三阶段方法：遗忘阶段（微调目标知识）、提醒阶段（恢复保留样本性能）、恢复阶段（通过模型汤恢复零样本能力），并结合知识蒸馏处理分布差异。

Conclusion: 该方法填补了精细知识遗忘的空白，为模型可靠性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) such as CLIP have demonstrated impressive zero-shot
performance across various tasks by leveraging large-scale, unsupervised
pre-training. However, they often inherit harmful or unwanted knowledge from
noisy internet-sourced datasets, compromising their reliability in real-world
applications. Existing model unlearning methods either rely on access to
pre-trained datasets or focus on coarse-grained unlearning (e.g., entire
classes), leaving a critical gap for fine-grained unlearning. In this paper, we
address the challenging scenario of selectively forgetting specific portions of
knowledge within a class, without access to pre-trained data, while preserving
the model's overall performance. We propose a novel three-stage approach that
progressively unlearns targeted knowledge while mitigating over-forgetting. It
consists of (1) a forgetting stage to fine-tune the CLIP on samples to be
forgotten, (2) a reminding stage to restore performance on retained samples,
and (3) a restoring stage to recover zero-shot capabilities using model
souping. Additionally, we introduce knowledge distillation to handle the
distribution disparity between forgetting, retaining samples, and unseen
pre-trained data. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, ImageNet-1K, and style
datasets demonstrate that our approach effectively unlearns specific subgroups
while maintaining strong zero-shot performance on semantically similar
subgroups and other categories, significantly outperforming baseline unlearning
methods, which lose effectiveness under the CLIP unlearning setting.

Motivation: 现有插值方法缺乏3D几何指导，难以处理复杂人体运动且控制有限。

Method: 提出PoseFuse3D-KI，结合3D人体信号和2D潜在空间，使用SMPL-X编码器和融合网络。

Result: 在CHKI-Video数据集上，PSNR提升9%，LPIPS降低38%。

Conclusion: PoseFuse3D-KI显著提升插值质量，验证了3D信号的有效性。

Abstract: Existing interpolation methods use pre-trained video diffusion priors to
generate intermediate frames between sparsely sampled keyframes. In the absence
of 3D geometric guidance, these methods struggle to produce plausible results
for complex, articulated human motions and offer limited control over the
synthesized dynamics. In this paper, we introduce PoseFuse3D Keyframe
Interpolator (PoseFuse3D-KI), a novel framework that integrates 3D human
guidance signals into the diffusion process for Controllable Human-centric
Keyframe Interpolation (CHKI). To provide rich spatial and structural cues for
interpolation, our PoseFuse3D, a 3D-informed control model, features a novel
SMPL-X encoder that transforms 3D geometry and shape into the 2D latent
conditioning space, alongside a fusion network that integrates these 3D cues
with 2D pose embeddings. For evaluation, we build CHKI-Video, a new dataset
annotated with both 2D poses and 3D SMPL-X parameters. We show that
PoseFuse3D-KI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on
CHKI-Video, achieving a 9% improvement in PSNR and a 38% reduction in LPIPS.
Comprehensive ablations demonstrate that our PoseFuse3D model improves
interpolation fidelity.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种双专家一致性模型（DCM），通过语义专家和细节专家的分工，解决了视频扩散模型蒸馏中的时间一致性和细节退化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接应用一致性模型到视频扩散模型会导致时间一致性和外观细节的严重退化，原因是蒸馏过程中不同时间步的优化梯度和损失贡献存在显著差异。

Method: 提出DCM模型，包含语义专家和细节专家，分别负责语义布局与运动学习和细节细化；引入时间相干损失和GAN/特征匹配损失以优化性能。

Result: DCM在显著减少采样步骤的同时，实现了最先进的视觉质量。

Conclusion: 专家分工策略在视频扩散模型蒸馏中有效，DCM模型在质量和效率上表现优异。

Abstract: Diffusion Models have achieved remarkable results in video synthesis but
require iterative denoising steps, leading to substantial computational
overhead. Consistency Models have made significant progress in accelerating
diffusion models. However, directly applying them to video diffusion models
often results in severe degradation of temporal consistency and appearance
details. In this paper, by analyzing the training dynamics of Consistency
Models, we identify a key conflicting learning dynamics during the distillation
process: there is a significant discrepancy in the optimization gradients and
loss contributions across different timesteps. This discrepancy prevents the
distilled student model from achieving an optimal state, leading to compromised
temporal consistency and degraded appearance details. To address this issue, we
propose a parameter-efficient \textbf{Dual-Expert Consistency Model~(DCM)},
where a semantic expert focuses on learning semantic layout and motion, while a
detail expert specializes in fine detail refinement. Furthermore, we introduce
Temporal Coherence Loss to improve motion consistency for the semantic expert
and apply GAN and Feature Matching Loss to enhance the synthesis quality of the
detail expert.Our approach achieves state-of-the-art visual quality with
significantly reduced sampling steps, demonstrating the effectiveness of expert
specialization in video diffusion model distillation. Our code and models are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AnimeShooter是一个参考引导的多镜头动画数据集，填补了现有数据集的不足，通过自动化流程提供层次化标注和视觉一致性，并引入AnimeShooterGen模型展示其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公共数据集缺乏角色参考图像和连贯的多镜头视频生成能力，限制了动画生产的质量。

Method: 提出AnimeShooter数据集，包含故事级和镜头级标注，并开发AnimeShooterGen模型，结合MLLM和视频扩散模型生成连贯视频。

Result: 实验表明，基于AnimeShooter训练的模型在跨镜头视觉一致性和参考视觉指导方面表现优异。

Conclusion: AnimeShooter为连贯动画视频生成提供了有价值的资源，并展示了其实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-generated content (AIGC) have significantly accelerated
animation production. To produce engaging animations, it is essential to
generate coherent multi-shot video clips with narrative scripts and character
references. However, existing public datasets primarily focus on real-world
scenarios with global descriptions, and lack reference images for consistent
character guidance. To bridge this gap, we present AnimeShooter, a
reference-guided multi-shot animation dataset. AnimeShooter features
comprehensive hierarchical annotations and strong visual consistency across
shots through an automated pipeline. Story-level annotations provide an
overview of the narrative, including the storyline, key scenes, and main
character profiles with reference images, while shot-level annotations
decompose the story into consecutive shots, each annotated with scene,
characters, and both narrative and descriptive visual captions. Additionally, a
dedicated subset, AnimeShooter-audio, offers synchronized audio tracks for each
shot, along with audio descriptions and sound sources. To demonstrate the
effectiveness of AnimeShooter and establish a baseline for the reference-guided
multi-shot video generation task, we introduce AnimeShooterGen, which leverages
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and video diffusion models. The
reference image and previously generated shots are first processed by MLLM to
produce representations aware of both reference and context, which are then
used as the condition for the diffusion model to decode the subsequent shot.
Experimental results show that the model trained on AnimeShooter achieves
superior cross-shot visual consistency and adherence to reference visual
guidance, which highlight the value of our dataset for coherent animated video
generation.

*Zidong Wang,Lei Bai,Xiangyu Yue,Wanli Ouyang,Yiyuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种原生分辨率图像合成方法，突破传统固定分辨率限制，支持任意分辨率和宽高比的图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法局限于固定分辨率和方形图像，无法灵活处理不同分辨率和宽高比的图像。

Method: 设计了原生分辨率扩散Transformer（NiT），通过建模可变长度视觉标记，支持任意分辨率和宽高比的图像生成。

Result: NiT在ImageNet-256x256和512x512基准测试中达到最优性能，并展示了零样本泛化能力，支持未见过的分辨率和宽高比。

Conclusion: 原生分辨率建模在视觉生成模型与大型语言模型方法之间具有重要潜力。

Abstract: We introduce native-resolution image synthesis, a novel generative modeling
paradigm that enables the synthesis of images at arbitrary resolutions and
aspect ratios. This approach overcomes the limitations of conventional
fixed-resolution, square-image methods by natively handling variable-length
visual tokens, a core challenge for traditional techniques. To this end, we
introduce the Native-resolution diffusion Transformer (NiT), an architecture
designed to explicitly model varying resolutions and aspect ratios within its
denoising process. Free from the constraints of fixed formats, NiT learns
intrinsic visual distributions from images spanning a broad range of
resolutions and aspect ratios. Notably, a single NiT model simultaneously
achieves the state-of-the-art performance on both ImageNet-256x256 and 512x512
benchmarks. Surprisingly, akin to the robust zero-shot capabilities seen in
advanced large language models, NiT, trained solely on ImageNet, demonstrates
excellent zero-shot generalization performance. It successfully generates
high-fidelity images at previously unseen high resolutions (e.g., 1536 x 1536)
and diverse aspect ratios (e.g., 16:9, 3:1, 4:3), as shown in Figure 1. These
findings indicate the significant potential of native-resolution modeling as a
bridge between visual generative modeling and advanced LLM methodologies.

Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在基础空间关系理解上表现有限，缺乏对复杂空间推理的评估。

Method: 通过互联网数据爬取和人工标注，构建了涵盖4大类50个子类别的OmniSpatial基准。

Result: 实验表明现有模型在全面空间理解上存在显著不足。

Conclusion: 提出了未来研究方向，以改进模型的空间推理能力。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning is a key aspect of cognitive psychology and remains a major
bottleneck for current vision-language models (VLMs). While extensive research
has aimed to evaluate or improve VLMs' understanding of basic spatial
relations, such as distinguishing left from right, near from far, and object
counting, these tasks represent only the most fundamental level of spatial
reasoning. In this work, we introduce OmniSpatial, a comprehensive and
challenging benchmark for spatial reasoning, grounded in cognitive psychology.
OmniSpatial covers four major categories: dynamic reasoning, complex spatial
logic, spatial interaction, and perspective-taking, with 50 fine-grained
subcategories. Through Internet data crawling and careful manual annotation, we
construct over 1.5K question-answer pairs. Extensive experiments show that both
open- and closed-source VLMs, as well as existing reasoning and spatial
understanding models, exhibit significant limitations in comprehensive spatial
understanding. We further analyze failure cases and propose potential
directions for future research.

Result: 专有模型显著优于开源模型，但所有模型在复杂性增加时性能下降；推理增强训练比单纯扩展更有效，风格迁移仍是最具挑战性的能力。

Conclusion: SVGenius为SVG处理提供了首个系统评估框架，为开发更强大的矢量图形模型和自动化图形设计应用提供了关键见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal LLMs have shown promising
capabilities for SVG processing, yet existing benchmarks suffer from limited
real-world coverage, lack of complexity stratification, and fragmented
evaluation paradigms. We introduce SVGenius, a comprehensive benchmark
comprising 2,377 queries across three progressive dimensions: understanding,
editing, and generation. Built on real-world data from 24 application domains
with systematic complexity stratification, SVGenius evaluates models through 8
task categories and 18 metrics. We assess 22 mainstream models spanning
different scales, architectures, training paradigms, and accessibility levels.
Our analysis reveals that while proprietary models significantly outperform
open-source counterparts, all models exhibit systematic performance degradation
with increasing complexity, indicating fundamental limitations in current
approaches; however, reasoning-enhanced training proves more effective than
pure scaling for overcoming these limitations, though style transfer remains
the most challenging capability across all model types. SVGenius establishes
the first systematic evaluation framework for SVG processing, providing crucial
insights for developing more capable vector graphics models and advancing
automated graphic design applications. Appendix and supplementary materials

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖显式相机参数序列，用户操作繁琐，尤其对复杂相机运动不友好。

Method: 提出CamCloneMaster框架，支持基于参考视频的相机控制，适用于图像到视频和视频到视频任务，并构建了Camera Clone数据集。

Result: 实验和用户研究表明，CamCloneMaster在相机可控性和视觉质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CamCloneMaster提供了一种更直观、高效的相机控制解决方案。

Abstract: Camera control is crucial for generating expressive and cinematic videos.
Existing methods rely on explicit sequences of camera parameters as control
conditions, which can be cumbersome for users to construct, particularly for
intricate camera movements. To provide a more intuitive camera control method,
we propose CamCloneMaster, a framework that enables users to replicate camera
movements from reference videos without requiring camera parameters or
test-time fine-tuning. CamCloneMaster seamlessly supports reference-based
camera control for both Image-to-Video and Video-to-Video tasks within a
unified framework. Furthermore, we present the Camera Clone Dataset, a
large-scale synthetic dataset designed for camera clone learning, encompassing
diverse scenes, subjects, and camera movements. Extensive experiments and user
studies demonstrate that CamCloneMaster outperforms existing methods in terms
of both camera controllability and visual quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Context-as-Memory的方法，通过利用历史上下文作为记忆来提升长视频生成的场景一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在长视频生成中因历史上下文利用不足而难以保持场景一致性。

Method: 1. 以帧格式存储上下文，无需额外后处理；2. 通过沿帧维度拼接上下文和待预测帧进行条件化，无需外部控制模块；3. 引入Memory Retrieval模块，通过相机姿态的FOV重叠选择相关上下文帧以减少计算开销。

Result: Context-as-Memory在交互式长视频生成中表现出卓越的记忆能力，优于现有技术，并能泛化至未见的开放域场景。

Conclusion: Context-as-Memory通过高效利用历史上下文，显著提升了长视频生成的场景一致性和计算效率。

Abstract: Recent advances in interactive video generation have shown promising results,
yet existing approaches struggle with scene-consistent memory capabilities in
long video generation due to limited use of historical context. In this work,
we propose Context-as-Memory, which utilizes historical context as memory for
video generation. It includes two simple yet effective designs: (1) storing
context in frame format without additional post-processing; (2) conditioning by
concatenating context and frames to be predicted along the frame dimension at
the input, requiring no external control modules. Furthermore, considering the
enormous computational overhead of incorporating all historical context, we
propose the Memory Retrieval module to select truly relevant context frames by
determining FOV (Field of View) overlap between camera poses, which
significantly reduces the number of candidate frames without substantial
information loss. Experiments demonstrate that Context-as-Memory achieves
superior memory capabilities in interactive long video generation compared to
SOTAs, even generalizing effectively to open-domain scenarios not seen during
training. The link of our project page is https://context-as-memory.github.io/.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了MERIT数据集和Coral框架，用于多条件语义检索，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集和模型在多条件语义检索中表现不足，无法充分利用视觉信息。

Method: 提出MERIT数据集和Coral框架，结合嵌入重构和对比学习。

Result: Coral在MERIT上性能提升45.9%，并在多个基准测试中验证。

Conclusion: 为多条件语义检索研究奠定基础。

Abstract: Semantic retrieval is crucial for modern applications yet remains
underexplored in current research. Existing datasets are limited to single
languages, single images, or singular retrieval conditions, often failing to
fully exploit the expressive capacity of visual information as evidenced by
maintained performance when images are replaced with captions. However,
practical retrieval scenarios frequently involve interleaved multi-condition
queries with multiple images. Hence, this paper introduces MERIT, the first
multilingual dataset for interleaved multi-condition semantic retrieval,
comprising 320,000 queries with 135,000 products in 5 languages, covering 7
distinct product categories. Extensive experiments on MERIT identify existing
models's limitation: focusing solely on global semantic information while
neglecting specific conditional elements in queries. Consequently, we propose
Coral, a novel fine-tuning framework that adapts pre-trained MLLMs by
integrating embedding reconstruction to preserve fine-grained conditional
elements and contrastive learning to extract comprehensive global semantics.
Experiments demonstrate that Coral achieves a 45.9% performance improvement
over conventional approaches on MERIT, with strong generalization capabilities
validated across 8 established retrieval benchmarks. Collectively, our
contributions - a novel dataset, identification of critical limitations in
existing approaches, and an innovative fine-tuning framework - establish a
foundation for future research in interleaved multi-condition semantic
retrieval.

Motivation: 现有统一模型在视觉语言理解和文本生成图像方面表现优异，但在图像感知和操作任务上不足，而GPT-4o-Image的成功激发了基于语义特征的研究。

Method: 提出UniWorld框架，利用视觉语言模型和对比语义编码器提取语义特征，构建统一生成模型。

Result: UniWorld仅用1%的BAGEL数据就在图像编辑任务上超越BAGEL，同时在图像理解和生成任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: UniWorld展示了基于语义特征的统一框架在图像感知和操作任务中的潜力，并开源了模型和数据集。

Abstract: Although existing unified models deliver strong performance on
vision-language understanding and text-to-image generation, their models are
limited in exploring image perception and manipulation tasks, which are
urgently desired by users for wide applications. Recently, OpenAI released
their powerful GPT-4o-Image model for comprehensive image perception and
manipulation, achieving expressive capability and attracting community
interests. By observing the performance of GPT-4o-Image in our carefully
constructed experiments, we infer that GPT-4o-Image leverages features
extracted by semantic encoders instead of VAE, while VAEs are considered
essential components in many image manipulation models. Motivated by such
inspiring observations, we present a unified generative framework named
UniWorld based on semantic features provided by powerful visual-language models
and contrastive semantic encoders. As a result, we build a strong unified model
using only 1% amount of BAGEL's data, which consistently outperforms BAGEL on
image editing benchmarks. UniWorld also maintains competitive image
understanding and generation capabilities, achieving strong performance across
multiple image perception tasks. We fully open-source our models, including
model weights, training and evaluation scripts, and datasets.

Motivation: 解决不同视觉模态（如RGB与深度图）间的像素对应问题，无需显式光一致性假设或对齐数据。

Method: 扩展对比随机游走框架，同时学习跨模态和模态内匹配的循环一致特征表示。

Result: 在RGB-深度、RGB-热成像等几何匹配及照片-草图等语义匹配任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法简单有效，无需对齐数据即可训练，适用于多种跨模态匹配任务。

Abstract: We present a method for finding cross-modal space-time correspondences. Given
two images from different visual modalities, such as an RGB image and a depth
map, our model identifies which pairs of pixels correspond to the same physical
points in the scene. To solve this problem, we extend the contrastive random
walk framework to simultaneously learn cycle-consistent feature representations
for both cross-modal and intra-modal matching. The resulting model is simple
and has no explicit photo-consistency assumptions. It can be trained entirely
using unlabeled data, without the need for any spatially aligned multimodal
image pairs. We evaluate our method on both geometric and semantic
correspondence tasks. For geometric matching, we consider challenging tasks
such as RGB-to-depth and RGB-to-thermal matching (and vice versa); for semantic
matching, we evaluate on photo-sketch and cross-style image alignment. Our
method achieves strong performance across all benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在控制场景光照和视觉外观时缺乏几何线索的显式集成，限制了视频生成的质量和可控性。

Method: IllumiCraft接受三种输入：HDR视频图、合成重光照帧和3D点轨迹，通过统一扩散架构整合这些线索。

Result: 生成的视频在时间一致性和用户提示对齐方面表现优异，支持背景和文本条件重光照，保真度高于现有方法。

Conclusion: IllumiCraft通过显式集成几何和光照线索，显著提升了可控视频生成的质量和灵活性。

Abstract: Although diffusion-based models can generate high-quality and high-resolution
video sequences from textual or image inputs, they lack explicit integration of
geometric cues when controlling scene lighting and visual appearance across
frames. To address this limitation, we propose IllumiCraft, an end-to-end
diffusion framework accepting three complementary inputs: (1)
high-dynamic-range (HDR) video maps for detailed lighting control; (2)
synthetically relit frames with randomized illumination changes (optionally
paired with a static background reference image) to provide appearance cues;
and (3) 3D point tracks that capture precise 3D geometry information. By
integrating the lighting, appearance, and geometry cues within a unified
diffusion architecture, IllumiCraft generates temporally coherent videos
aligned with user-defined prompts. It supports background-conditioned and
text-conditioned video relighting and provides better fidelity than existing
controllable video generation methods. Project Page:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时视频理解在微创手术中至关重要，但监督学习方法需要大量标注数据，而医学领域的数据标注成本高昂。现有自监督方法难以捕捉通用的结构和物理信息。

Method: C2E通过熵最大化解码器压缩图像，同时保留临床相关细节，利用Kolmogorov复杂度学习紧凑表示。

Result: 在大规模未标注手术数据集上训练，C2E在多种手术ML任务中表现出强泛化能力，如工作流分类、工具-组织交互分类、分割和诊断任务。

Conclusion: C2E展示了自监督学习在提升手术AI性能和改善微创手术结果方面的潜力。

Abstract: Real-time video understanding is critical to guide procedures in minimally
invasive surgery (MIS). However, supervised learning approaches require large,
annotated datasets that are scarce due to annotation efforts that are
prohibitive, e.g., in medical fields. Although self-supervision methods can
address such limitations, current self-supervised methods often fail to capture
structural and physical information in a form that generalizes across tasks. We
propose Compress-to-Explore (C2E), a novel self-supervised framework that
leverages Kolmogorov complexity to learn compact, informative representations
from surgical videos. C2E uses entropy-maximizing decoders to compress images
while preserving clinically relevant details, improving encoder performance
without labeled data. Trained on large-scale unlabeled surgical datasets, C2E
demonstrates strong generalization across a variety of surgical ML tasks, such
as workflow classification, tool-tissue interaction classification,
segmentation, and diagnosis tasks, providing improved performance as a surgical
visual foundation model. As we further show in the paper, the model's internal
compact representation better disentangles features from different structural
parts of images. The resulting performance improvements highlight the yet
untapped potential of self-supervised learning to enhance surgical AI and
improve outcomes in MIS.

Abstract: Previous works in the literature apply 3D spatial-only models on 4D
functional MRI data leading to possible sub-par feature extraction to be used
for downstream tasks like classification. In this work, we aim to develop a
novel 4D convolution network to extract 4D joint temporal-spatial kernels that
not only learn spatial information but in addition also capture temporal
dynamics. Experimental results show promising performance in capturing
spatial-temporal data in functional MRI compared to 3D models. The 4D CNN model
improves Alzheimers disease diagnosis for rs-fMRI data, enabling earlier
detection and better interventions. Future research could explore task-based

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估指标（如SSIM和PSNR）难以捕捉关键解剖结构的完整性，尤其是小或薄区域。

Method: 提出解剖感知评估指标和CARE框架，通过结构惩罚训练增强解剖结构的保留。

Result: CARE显著提升了重建结构的完整性，大器官提升32%，小器官22%，肠道40%，血管36%。

Conclusion: CARE是一种模型无关的框架，可显著改善CT重建中解剖结构的完整性。

Abstract: Widely adopted evaluation metrics for sparse-view CT reconstruction--such as
Structural Similarity Index Measure and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio--prioritize
pixel-wise fidelity but often fail to capture the completeness of critical
anatomical structures, particularly small or thin regions that are easily
missed. To address this limitation, we propose a suite of novel anatomy-aware
evaluation metrics designed to assess structural completeness across anatomical
structures, including large organs, small organs, intestines, and vessels.
Building on these metrics, we introduce CARE, a Completeness-Aware
Reconstruction Enhancement framework that incorporates structural penalties
during training to encourage anatomical preservation of significant structures.
CARE is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into analytical,
implicit, and generative methods. When applied to these methods, CARE
substantially improves structural completeness in CT reconstructions, achieving
up to +32% improvement for large organs, +22% for small organs, +40% for
intestines, and +36% for vessels.

Conclusion: FORCE框架通过结合生成模型和数据保真度，有效解决了CT重建中的噪声和伪影问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Computed tomography (CT) is a major medical imaging modality. Clinical CT
scenarios, such as low-dose screening, sparse-view scanning, and metal
implants, often lead to severe noise and artifacts in reconstructed images,
requiring improved reconstruction techniques. The introduction of deep learning
has significantly advanced CT image reconstruction. However, obtaining paired
training data remains rather challenging due to patient motion and other
constraints. Although deep learning methods can still perform well with
approximately paired data, they inherently carry the risk of hallucination due
to data inconsistencies and model instability. In this paper, we integrate the
data fidelity with the state-of-the-art generative AI model, referred to as the
Poisson flow generative model (PFGM) with a generalized version PFGM++, and
propose a novel CT framework: Flow-Oriented Reconstruction Conditioning Engine
(FORCE). In our experiments, the proposed method shows superior performance in
various CT imaging tasks, outperforming existing unsupervised reconstruction
approaches.

TL;DR: DEFFA-Unet提出了一种改进的视网膜血管分割方法，通过额外编码器、特征过滤融合模块和注意力引导的特征重建融合模块，解决了数据不足、分布不平衡和特征提取不足的问题，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视网膜血管分割对诊断眼部和心血管疾病至关重要，但现有方法如U-Net仍面临训练数据不足、数据分布不平衡和特征提取不充分等问题，限制了分割性能和模型泛化能力。

Method: DEFFA-Unet引入额外编码器处理域不变预处理输入，开发特征过滤融合模块和注意力引导的特征重建融合模块，并提出创新的数据增强和平衡方法。

Result: 在四个基准数据集和一个SLO数据集上的广泛验证表明，该方法在分割性能和模型泛化能力上优于基线和最先进模型，尤其在跨验证模型泛化中表现突出。

Conclusion: DEFFA-Unet通过改进特征提取和融合机制，结合数据增强和平衡策略，显著提升了视网膜血管分割的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Retinal blood vessel segmentation is crucial for diagnosing ocular and
cardiovascular diseases. Although the introduction of U-Net in 2015 by Olaf
Ronneberger significantly advanced this field, yet issues like limited training
data, imbalance data distribution, and inadequate feature extraction persist,
hindering both the segmentation performance and optimal model generalization.
Addressing these critical issues, the DEFFA-Unet is proposed featuring an
additional encoder to process domain-invariant pre-processed inputs, thereby
improving both richer feature encoding and enhanced model generalization. A
feature filtering fusion module is developed to ensure the precise feature
filtering and robust hybrid feature fusion. In response to the task-specific
need for higher precision where false positives are very costly, traditional
skip connections are replaced with the attention-guided feature reconstructing
fusion module. Additionally, innovative data augmentation and balancing methods
are proposed to counter data scarcity and distribution imbalance, further
boosting the robustness and generalization of the model. With a comprehensive
suite of evaluation metrics, extensive validations on four benchmark datasets
(DRIVE, CHASEDB1, STARE, and HRF) and an SLO dataset (IOSTAR), demonstrate the
proposed method's superiority over both baseline and state-of-the-art models.
Particularly the proposed method significantly outperforms the compared methods
in cross-validation model generalization.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的非凸图总变分（NC-GTV）方法，用于图像去噪，通过图Huber函数确保目标函数凸性，并设计高效算法和轻量级网络。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于模型的图像去噪方法使用凸正则化项（如TV），但存在局限性，因此提出非凸图总变分方法以提升性能。

Method: 定义NC-GTV为图Huber函数，通过Gershgorin圆定理确保目标凸性，并基于ADMM设计线性时间算法，进一步展开为轻量级网络。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在图像去噪性能上优于其他代表性方法，且网络参数更少。

Conclusion: NC-GTV方法在图像去噪中表现出色，兼具高效性和轻量化。

Abstract: Conventional model-based image denoising optimizations employ convex
regularization terms, such as total variation (TV) that convexifies the
$\ell_0$-norm to promote sparse signal representation. Instead, we propose a
new non-convex total variation term in a graph setting (NC-GTV), such that when
combined with an $\ell_2$-norm fidelity term for denoising, leads to a convex
objective with no extraneous local minima. We define NC-GTV using a new graph
variant of the Huber function, interpretable as a Moreau envelope. The crux is
the selection of a parameter $a$ characterizing the graph Huber function that
ensures overall objective convexity; we efficiently compute $a$ via an
adaptation of Gershgorin Circle Theorem (GCT). To minimize the convex
objective, we design a linear-time algorithm based on Alternating Direction
Method of Multipliers (ADMM) and unroll it into a lightweight feed-forward
network for data-driven parameter learning. Experiments show that our method
outperforms unrolled GTV and other representative image denoising schemes,
while employing far fewer network parameters.

Result: 实验表明，SwinUNETR在图像质量、解剖一致性和诊断价值方面表现优异。

Conclusion: SwinUNETR是一种有效的解决方案，能够生成高质量的合成MRI图像，具有临床实用价值。

Abstract: Multi-modal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays a crucial role in
clinical diagnostics by providing complementary information across different
imaging modalities. However, a common challenge in clinical practice is missing
MRI modalities. In this paper, we apply SwinUNETR to the synthesize of missing
modalities in brain MRI. SwinUNETR is a novel neural network architecture
designed for medical image analysis, integrating the strengths of Swin
Transformer and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The Swin Transformer, a
variant of the Vision Transformer (ViT), incorporates hierarchical feature
extraction and window-based self-attention mechanisms, enabling it to capture
both local and global contextual information effectively. By combining the Swin
Transformer with CNNs, SwinUNETR merges global context awareness with detailed
spatial resolution. This hybrid approach addresses the challenges posed by the
varying modality characteristics and complex brain structures, facilitating the
generation of accurate and realistic synthetic images. We evaluate the
performance of SwinUNETR on brain MRI datasets and demonstrate its superior
capability in generating clinically valuable images. Our results show
significant improvements in image quality, anatomical consistency, and
diagnostic value.

Conclusion: TSRNet通过树架构和跨域信息提取，显著提升了图像超分辨率的性能。

Abstract: Deep convolutional neural networks can extract more accurate structural
information via deep architectures to obtain good performance in image
super-resolution. However, it is not easy to find effect of important layers in
a single network architecture to decrease performance of super-resolution. In
this paper, we design a tree-guided CNN for image super-resolution (TSRNet). It
uses a tree architecture to guide a deep network to enhance effect of key nodes
to amplify the relation of hierarchical information for improving the ability
of recovering images. To prevent insufficiency of the obtained structural
information, cosine transform techniques in the TSRNet are used to extract
cross-domain information to improve the performance of image super-resolution.
Adaptive Nesterov momentum optimizer (Adan) is applied to optimize parameters
to boost effectiveness of training a super-resolution model. Extended
experiments can verify superiority of the proposed TSRNet for restoring
high-quality images. Its code can be obtained at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于计算机视觉的粘度计，通过自动化倒置瓶测试实现粘度定量测量，覆盖范围广且成本低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统倒置瓶测试因复杂流动难以定量测量粘度，需要一种简单、低成本且可扩展的方法。

Method: 使用计算机视觉和神经网络，通过记录流体流动视频并提取视觉特征，结合已知密度推断粘度。

Result: 方法在0.01-1000 Pas范围内相对误差低于25%，对非牛顿流体也能可靠估计零剪切粘度。

Conclusion: 该方法简化了粘度测量，适用于高通量实验和资源有限环境，为数据驱动材料模型提供了新工具。

Abstract: Although the inverted vial test has been widely used as a qualitative method
for estimating fluid viscosity, quantitative rheological characterization has
remained limited due to its complex, uncontrolled flow - driven by gravity,
surface tension, inertia, and initial conditions. Here, we present a computer
vision (CV) viscometer that automates the inverted vial test and enables
quantitative viscosity inference across nearly five orders of magnitude
(0.01-1000 Pas), without requiring direct velocity field measurements. The
system simultaneously inverts multiple vials and records videos of the evolving
fluid, which are fed into a neural network that approximates the inverse
function from visual features and known fluid density. Despite the complex,
multi-regime flow within the vial, our approach achieves relative errors below
25%, improving to 15% for viscosities above 0.1 Pas. When tested on
non-Newtonian polymer solutions, the method reliably estimates zero-shear
viscosity as long as viscoelastic or shear-thinning behaviors remain negligible
within the flow regime. Moreover, high standard deviations in the inferred
values may serve as a proxy for identifying fluids with strong non-Newtonian
behavior. The CV viscometer requires only one camera and one motor, is
contactless and low-cost, and can be easily integrated into high-throughput
experimental automated and manual workflows. Transcending traditional
characterization paradigms, our method leverages uncontrolled flows and visual
features to achieve simplicity and scalability, enabling high-throughput
viscosity inference that can meet the growing demand of data-driven material
models while remaining accessible to lower resource environments.

Conclusion: FlexPainter通过多模态引导和一致性优化，实现了高质量、灵活的纹理生成。

Abstract: Texture map production is an important part of 3D modeling and determines the
rendering quality. Recently, diffusion-based methods have opened a new way for
texture generation. However, restricted control flexibility and limited prompt
modalities may prevent creators from producing desired results. Furthermore,
inconsistencies between generated multi-view images often lead to poor texture
generation quality. To address these issues, we introduce \textbf{FlexPainter},
a novel texture generation pipeline that enables flexible multi-modal
conditional guidance and achieves highly consistent texture generation. A
shared conditional embedding space is constructed to perform flexible
aggregation between different input modalities. Utilizing such embedding space,
we present an image-based CFG method to decompose structural and style
information, achieving reference image-based stylization. Leveraging the 3D
knowledge within the image diffusion prior, we first generate multi-view images
simultaneously using a grid representation to enhance global understanding.
Meanwhile, we propose a view synchronization and adaptive weighting module
during diffusion sampling to further ensure local consistency. Finally, a
3D-aware texture completion model combined with a texture enhancement model is
used to generate seamless, high-resolution texture maps. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both flexibility and generation quality.

Conclusion: 该系统成功实现了低延迟、城市规模的3D高斯泼溅渲染，适用于移动设备。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is an emerging technique for photorealistic 3D
scene rendering. However, rendering city-scale 3DGS scenes on mobile devices,
e.g., your smartphones, remains a significant challenge due to the limited
resources on mobile devices. A natural solution is to offload computation to
the cloud; however, naively streaming rendered frames from the cloud to the
client introduces high latency and requires bandwidth far beyond the capacity
of current wireless networks.
  In this paper, we propose an effective solution to enable city-scale 3DGS
rendering on mobile devices. Our key insight is that, under normal user motion,
the number of newly visible Gaussians per second remains roughly constant.
Leveraging this, we stream only the necessary Gaussians to the client.
Specifically, on the cloud side, we propose asynchronous level-of-detail search
to identify the necessary Gaussians for the client. On the client side, we
accelerate rendering via a lookup table-based rasterization. Combined with
holistic runtime optimizations, our system can deliver low-latency, city-scale
3DGS rendering on mobile devices. Compared to existing solutions, Voyager
achieves over 100$\times$ reduction on data transfer and up to 8.9$\times$
speedup while retaining comparable rendering quality.

Abstract: We introduce PhysGaia, a novel physics-aware dataset specifically designed
for Dynamic Novel View Synthesis (DyNVS), encompassing both structured objects
and unstructured physical phenomena. Unlike existing datasets that primarily
focus on photorealistic reconstruction, PhysGaia is created to actively support
physics-aware dynamic scene modeling. Our dataset provides complex dynamic
scenarios with rich interactions among multiple objects, where they
realistically collide with each other and exchange forces. Furthermore, it
contains a diverse range of physical materials, such as liquid, gas,
viscoelastic substance, and textile, which moves beyond the rigid bodies
prevalent in existing datasets. All scenes in PhysGaia are faithfully generated
to strictly adhere to physical laws, leveraging carefully selected
material-specific physics solvers. To enable quantitative evaluation of
physical modeling, our dataset provides essential ground-truth information,
including 3D particle trajectories and physics parameters, e.g., viscosity. To
facilitate research adoption, we also provide essential integration pipelines
for using state-of-the-art DyNVS models with our dataset and report their
results. By addressing the critical lack of datasets for physics-aware
modeling, PhysGaia will significantly advance research in dynamic view
synthesis, physics-based scene understanding, and deep learning models
integrated with physical simulation -- ultimately enabling more faithful
reconstruction and interpretation of complex dynamic scenes. Our datasets and

Abstract: 3D human reconstruction and animation are long-standing topics in computer
graphics and vision. However, existing methods typically rely on sophisticated
dense-view capture and/or time-consuming per-subject optimization procedures.
To address these limitations, we propose HumanRAM, a novel feed-forward
approach for generalizable human reconstruction and animation from monocular or
sparse human images. Our approach integrates human reconstruction and animation
into a unified framework by introducing explicit pose conditions, parameterized
by a shared SMPL-X neural texture, into transformer-based large reconstruction
models (LRM). Given monocular or sparse input images with associated camera
parameters and SMPL-X poses, our model employs scalable transformers and a
DPT-based decoder to synthesize realistic human renderings under novel
viewpoints and novel poses. By leveraging the explicit pose conditions, our
model simultaneously enables high-quality human reconstruction and
high-fidelity pose-controlled animation. Experiments show that HumanRAM
significantly surpasses previous methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy,
animation fidelity, and generalization performance on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: SA-Radar是一种通用雷达数据引擎，支持新传感器视角和场景编辑，适用于自动驾驶。

Abstract: We present SA-Radar (Simulate Any Radar), a radar simulation approach that
enables controllable and efficient generation of radar cubes conditioned on
customizable radar attributes. Unlike prior generative or physics-based
simulators, SA-Radar integrates both paradigms through a waveform-parameterized
attribute embedding. We design ICFAR-Net, a 3D U-Net conditioned on radar
attributes encoded via waveform parameters, which captures signal variations
induced by different radar configurations. This formulation bypasses the need
for detailed radar hardware specifications and allows efficient simulation of
range-azimuth-Doppler (RAD) tensors across diverse sensor settings. We further
construct a mixed real-simulated dataset with attribute annotations to robustly
train the network. Extensive evaluations on multiple downstream tasks-including
2D/3D object detection and radar semantic segmentation-demonstrate that

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究扩散模型在联想记忆框架下的行为，以理解其记忆与泛化的动态特性。

Method: 将扩散模型的训练和生成阶段分别类比为记忆编码和检索，分析其在不同数据规模下的行为。

Result: 在小数据下模型表现出强记忆性，大数据下则出现新的吸引子状态，虚假状态在过渡边界出现。

Conclusion: 研究为扩散模型的记忆-泛化现象提供了新视角，并验证了虚假状态的存在。

Abstract: Hopfield networks are associative memory (AM) systems, designed for storing
and retrieving patterns as local minima of an energy landscape. In the
classical Hopfield model, an interesting phenomenon occurs when the amount of
training data reaches its critical memory load $- spurious\,\,states$, or
unintended stable points, emerge at the end of the retrieval dynamics, leading
to incorrect recall. In this work, we examine diffusion models, commonly used
in generative modeling, from the perspective of AMs. The training phase of
diffusion model is conceptualized as memory encoding (training data is stored
in the memory). The generation phase is viewed as an attempt of memory
retrieval. In the small data regime the diffusion model exhibits a strong
memorization phase, where the network creates distinct basins of attraction
around each sample in the training set, akin to the Hopfield model below the
critical memory load. In the large data regime, a different phase appears where
an increase in the size of the training set fosters the creation of new
attractor states that correspond to manifolds of the generated samples.
Spurious states appear at the boundary of this transition and correspond to
emergent attractor states, which are absent in the training set, but, at the
same time, have distinct basins of attraction around them. Our findings
provide: a novel perspective on the memorization-generalization phenomenon in
diffusion models via the lens of AMs, theoretical prediction of existence of
spurious states, empirical validation of this prediction in commonly-used
diffusion models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RPM解决模型依赖选项池配置，限制了推理能力，需改进。

Method: 提出Johnny架构（表示提取与推理模块）和Spin-Transformer网络（优化位置关系捕捉）。

Result: 实验显示Johnny和Spin-Transformer在RPM任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 这些方法为提升AI抽象推理能力提供了创新方案。

Abstract: This paper thoroughly investigates the challenges of enhancing AI's abstract
reasoning capabilities, with a particular focus on Raven's Progressive Matrices
(RPM) tasks involving complex human-like concepts. Firstly, it dissects the
empirical reality that traditional end-to-end RPM-solving models heavily rely
on option pool configurations, highlighting that this dependency constrains the
model's reasoning capabilities. To address this limitation, the paper proposes
the Johnny architecture - a novel representation space-based framework for
RPM-solving. Through the synergistic operation of its Representation Extraction
Module and Reasoning Module, Johnny significantly enhances reasoning
performance by supplementing primitive negative option configurations with a
learned representation space. Furthermore, to strengthen the model's capacity
for capturing positional relationships among local features, the paper
introduces the Spin-Transformer network architecture, accompanied by a
lightweight Straw Spin-Transformer variant that reduces computational overhead
through parameter sharing and attention mechanism optimization. Experimental
evaluations demonstrate that both Johnny and Spin-Transformer achieve superior
performance on RPM tasks, offering innovative methodologies for advancing AI's
abstract reasoning capabilities.

Motivation: 人类能够学习和保留多种任务的能力激发了人工通用智能的研究，而持续学习是实现这一目标的重要步骤。任务变异性和上下文切换对神经网络学习具有挑战性。

Method: 提出EWGN架构，通过附加网络动态生成主网络的权重，实现输入依赖的上下文切换。实验使用MNIST和fashion-MNIST数据集，对比分析了全连接网络、卷积神经网络和EWGN的性能。

Result: EWGN在保留先前学习任务表征方面表现优于传统网络架构，结合随机梯度下降和弹性权重巩固算法进一步提升了性能。

Conclusion: 动态权重生成和上下文切换能力有助于实现持续学习，提升模型性能。

Abstract: The ability to learn and retain a wide variety of tasks is a hallmark of
human intelligence that has inspired research in artificial general
intelligence. Continual learning approaches provide a significant step towards
achieving this goal. It has been known that task variability and context
switching are challenging for learning in neural networks. Catastrophic
forgetting refers to the poor performance on retention of a previously learned
task when a new task is being learned. Switching between different task
contexts can be a useful approach to mitigate the same by preventing the
interference between the varying task weights of the network. This paper
introduces Elastic Weight Generative Networks (EWGN) as an idea for context
switching between two different tasks. The proposed EWGN architecture uses an
additional network that generates the weights of the primary network
dynamically while consolidating the weights learned. The weight generation is
input-dependent and thus enables context switching. Using standard computer
vision datasets, namely MNIST and fashion-MNIST, we analyse the retention of
previously learned task representations in Fully Connected Networks,
Convolutional Neural Networks, and EWGN architectures with Stochastic Gradient
Descent and Elastic Weight Consolidation learning algorithms. Understanding
dynamic weight generation and context-switching ability can be useful in
enabling continual learning for improved performance.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为MaskedOptim的两阶段优化框架，旨在解决联邦学习中的复杂标签噪声问题，通过检测噪声客户端和标签校正机制提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中客户端提供的标注数据可能存在不同程度的标签噪声，影响模型性能，因此需要一种有效的优化策略来减轻噪声客户端的负面影响。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：第一阶段检测高噪声率的客户端；第二阶段通过端到端标签校正机制修正噪声数据标签，并使用几何中值模型聚合增强鲁棒性。

Result: 在多种标签噪声模式的图像和文本数据集上验证，框架表现出鲁棒性，并有效提升了噪声客户端本地数据集的质量。

Conclusion: MaskedOptim框架能有效解决联邦学习中的标签噪声问题，提升模型性能和数据质量。

Abstract: In recent years, federated learning (FL) has made significant advance in
privacy-sensitive applications. However, it can be hard to ensure that FL
participants provide well-annotated data for training. The corresponding
annotations from different clients often contain complex label noise at varying
levels. This label noise issue has a substantial impact on the performance of
the trained models, and clients with greater noise levels can be largely
attributed for this degradation. To this end, it is necessary to develop an
effective optimization strategy to alleviate the adverse effects of these noisy
clients.In this study, we present a two-stage optimization framework,
MaskedOptim, to address this intricate label noise problem. The first stage is
designed to facilitate the detection of noisy clients with higher label noise
rates. The second stage focuses on rectifying the labels of the noisy clients'
data through an end-to-end label correction mechanism, aiming to mitigate the
negative impacts caused by misinformation within datasets. This is achieved by
learning the potential ground-truth labels of the noisy clients' datasets via
backpropagation. To further enhance the training robustness, we apply the
geometric median based model aggregation instead of the commonly-used vanilla
averaged model aggregation. We implement sixteen related methods and conduct
evaluations on three image datasets and one text dataset with diverse label
noise patterns for a comprehensive comparison. Extensive experimental results
indicate that our proposed framework shows its robustness in different
scenarios. Additionally, our label correction framework effectively enhances
the data quality of the detected noisy clients' local datasets. % Our codes
will be open-sourced to facilitate related research communities. Our codes are
available via https://github.com/Sprinter1999/MaskedOptim .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何通过合成RL数据进一步改进基于验证奖励的强化学习（RLVR）训练效果。

Method: 提出SynthRL管道，包括种子问题选择、问题增强和验证三个阶段，确保数据的正确性和难度提升。

Result: 在MMK12数据集上合成3.3K额外问题，模型在多个视觉数学推理基准测试中表现优于基线。

Conclusion: SynthRL能有效提升模型的复杂推理能力，尤其在最具挑战性的样本上表现突出。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) trained via reinforcement learning with
verifiable reward (RLVR) have shown notable progress in scaling test-time
compute effectively. In this work, we investigate how synthesized RL data can
further improve RLVR. To this end, we propose \textbf{SynthRL}-a scalable and
guaranteed pipeline for automatic data scaling in reasoning-oriented RL
training. SynthRL comprises three key stages: (1) selecting seed questions with
appropriate distribution, (2) augmenting them into more challenging variants
while preserving the original answers, and (3) a guaranteed verification stage
that ensures near-perfect correctness and difficulty enhancement. Our empirical
experiments demonstrate SynthRL's scalability and effectiveness. When applied
to the MMK12 dataset, SynthRL synthesizes over 3.3K additional verifiable,
challenging questions from approximately 8K seed samples. Models trained with
our synthesized data achieve consistent gains across five out-of-domain visual
math reasoning benchmarks, with a significant improvement over baseline models
trained on seed data alone. Notably, detailed analysis reveals that the gains
are more pronounced on the most challenging evaluation samples, highlighting
SynthRL's effectiveness in eliciting deeper and more complex reasoning
patterns.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）的机器遗忘方法PUBG，旨在解决现有遗忘方法导致的副作用（如退化、幻觉或过度拒绝回答），同时确保隐私保护和信息丰富的响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有遗忘方法在保护隐私的同时，往往忽视了生成响应的质量和信息量，导致模型行为异常。

Method: 提出了一种新的遗忘任务，要求模型生成既隐私保护又信息丰富的响应，并设计了PUBG方法，通过引导模型输出分布来优化行为。

Result: 实验表明，PUBG能有效避免遗忘副作用，生成视觉基础和信息丰富的响应，同时防止隐私泄露。

Conclusion: PUBG为LVLMs提供了一种更有效的遗忘方法，兼顾隐私保护和响应质量。

Abstract: Machine unlearning is used to mitigate the privacy risks of Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) arising from training on large-scale web data.
However, existing unlearning methods often fail to carefully select substitute
outputs for forget targets, resulting in Unlearning Aftermaths-undesirable
behaviors such as degenerate, hallucinated, or excessively refused responses.
We highlight that, especially for generative LVLMs, it is crucial to consider
the quality and informativeness of post-unlearning responses rather than
relying solely on naive suppression. To address this, we introduce a new
unlearning task for LVLMs that requires models to provide privacy-preserving
yet informative and visually grounded responses. We also propose PUBG, a novel
unlearning method that explicitly guides post-unlearning behavior toward a
desirable output distribution. Experiments show that, while existing methods
suffer from Unlearning Aftermaths despite successfully preventing privacy
violations, PUBG effectively mitigates these issues, generating visually
grounded and informative responses without privacy leakage for forgotten
targets.

Conclusion: HIEGNet为肾小球分类提供了有效解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently been found to excel in
histopathology. However, an important histopathological task, where GNNs have
not been extensively explored, is the classification of glomeruli health as an
important indicator in nephropathology. This task presents unique difficulties,
particularly for the graph construction, i.e., the identification of nodes,
edges, and informative features. In this work, we propose a pipeline composed
of different traditional and machine learning-based computer vision techniques
to identify nodes, edges, and their corresponding features to form a
heterogeneous graph. We then proceed to propose a novel heterogeneous GNN
architecture for glomeruli classification, called HIEGNet, that integrates both
glomeruli and their surrounding immune cells. Hence, HIEGNet is able to
consider the immune environment of each glomerulus in its classification. Our
HIEGNet was trained and tested on a dataset of Whole Slide Images from kidney
transplant patients. Experimental results demonstrate that HIEGNet outperforms
several baseline models and generalises best between patients among all
baseline models. Our implementation is publicly available at
https://github.com/nklsKrmnn/HIEGNet.git.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Siamese网络的代理模型SiamNAS，用于高效解决多目标神经架构搜索（NAS）问题，显著降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代NAS是多目标的，需要在准确性、参数数量和计算成本之间权衡，导致计算开销大且难以高效解决。

Method: 采用Siamese网络块集成作为代理模型，预测候选架构的支配关系，并基于模型大小设计启发式规则替代拥挤距离计算。

Result: SiamNAS在NAS-Bench-201上实现了92%的准确率，仅用0.01 GPU天就找到了Pareto最优解。

Conclusion: SiamNAS展示了在多任务优化中的潜力，并可能扩展到生成多样化的Pareto最优解集。

Abstract: Modern neural architecture search (NAS) is inherently multi-objective,
balancing trade-offs such as accuracy, parameter count, and computational cost.
This complexity makes NAS computationally expensive and nearly impossible to
solve without efficient approximations. To address this, we propose a novel
surrogate modelling approach that leverages an ensemble of Siamese network
blocks to predict dominance relationships between candidate architectures.
Lightweight and easy to train, the surrogate achieves 92% accuracy and replaces
the crowding distance calculation in the survivor selection strategy with a
heuristic rule based on model size. Integrated into a framework termed SiamNAS,
this design eliminates costly evaluations during the search process.
Experiments on NAS-Bench-201 demonstrate the framework's ability to identify
Pareto-optimal solutions with significantly reduced computational costs. The
proposed SiamNAS identified a final non-dominated set containing the best
architecture in NAS-Bench-201 for CIFAR-10 and the second-best for ImageNet, in
terms of test error rate, within 0.01 GPU days. This proof-of-concept study
highlights the potential of the proposed Siamese network surrogate model to
generalise to multi-tasking optimisation, enabling simultaneous optimisation
across tasks. Additionally, it offers opportunities to extend the approach for
generating Sets of Pareto Sets (SOS), providing diverse Pareto-optimal
solutions for heterogeneous task settings.

Motivation: EFM需要建模复杂的静电场，但这一任务具有挑战性，因此作者希望通过更通用的交互场来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了IFM方法，利用通用交互场替代静电场，并设计了一种基于强相互作用的特定实现。

Result: 在玩具和图像数据转移问题上展示了IFM的性能。

Conclusion: IFM是一种有效的EFM扩展方法，解决了建模复杂场的问题。

Abstract: Electrostatic field matching (EFM) has recently appeared as a novel
physics-inspired paradigm for data generation and transfer using the idea of an
electric capacitor. However, it requires modeling electrostatic fields using
neural networks, which is non-trivial because of the necessity to take into
account the complex field outside the capacitor plates. In this paper, we
propose Interaction Field Matching (IFM), a generalization of EFM which allows
using general interaction fields beyond the electrostatic one. Furthermore,
inspired by strong interactions between quarks and antiquarks in physics, we
design a particular interaction field realization which solves the problems
which arise when modeling electrostatic fields in EFM. We show the performance
on a series of toy and image data transfer problems.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is an emerging media representation that
reconstructs real-world 3D scenes in high fidelity, enabling
6-degrees-of-freedom (6-DoF) navigation in virtual reality (VR). However,
developing and evaluating 3DGS-enabled applications and optimizing their
rendering performance, require realistic user navigation data. Such data is
currently unavailable for photorealistic 3DGS reconstructions of real-world
scenes. This paper introduces EyeNavGS (EyeNavGS), the first publicly available
6-DoF navigation dataset featuring traces from 46 participants exploring twelve
diverse, real-world 3DGS scenes. The dataset was collected at two sites, using
the Meta Quest Pro headsets, recording the head pose and eye gaze data for each
rendered frame during free world standing 6-DoF navigation. For each of the
twelve scenes, we performed careful scene initialization to correct for scene
tilt and scale, ensuring a perceptually-comfortable VR experience. We also
release our open-source SIBR viewer software fork with record-and-replay
functionalities and a suite of utility tools for data processing, conversion,
and visualization. The EyeNavGS dataset and its accompanying software tools
provide valuable resources for advancing research in 6-DoF viewport prediction,
adaptive streaming, 3D saliency, and foveated rendering for 3DGS scenes. The

Abstract: With the surge and widespread application of image generation models, data
privacy and content safety have become major concerns and attracted great
attention from users, service providers, and policymakers. Machine unlearning
(MU) is recognized as a cost-effective and promising means to address these
challenges. Despite some advancements, image generation model unlearning (IGMU)
still faces remarkable gaps in practice, e.g., unclear task discrimination and
unlearning guidelines, lack of an effective evaluation framework, and
unreliable evaluation metrics. These can hinder the understanding of unlearning
mechanisms and the design of practical unlearning algorithms. We perform
exhaustive assessments over existing state-of-the-art unlearning algorithms and
evaluation standards, and discover several critical flaws and challenges in
IGMU tasks. Driven by these limitations, we make several core contributions, to
facilitate the comprehensive understanding, standardized categorization, and
reliable evaluation of IGMU. Specifically, (1) We design CatIGMU, a novel
hierarchical task categorization framework. It provides detailed implementation
guidance for IGMU, assisting in the design of unlearning algorithms and the
construction of testbeds. (2) We introduce EvalIGMU, a comprehensive evaluation
framework. It includes reliable quantitative metrics across five critical
aspects. (3) We construct DataIGM, a high-quality unlearning dataset, which can
be used for extensive evaluations of IGMU, training content detectors for
judgment, and benchmarking the state-of-the-art unlearning algorithms. With
EvalIGMU and DataIGM, we discover that most existing IGMU algorithms cannot
handle the unlearning well across different evaluation dimensions, especially
for preservation and robustness. Code and models are available at

Abstract: Computer use agents (CUA) are systems that automatically interact with
graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to complete tasks. CUA have made significant
progress with the advent of large vision-language models (VLMs). However, these
agents typically rely on cloud-based inference with substantial compute
demands, raising critical privacy and scalability concerns, especially when
operating on personal devices. In this work, we take a step toward
privacy-preserving and resource-efficient agents by developing a lightweight
vision-language model that runs entirely on local machines. To train this
compact agent, we introduce an LLM-as-Judge framework that automatically
evaluates and filters synthetic interaction trajectories, producing
high-quality data for reinforcement learning without human annotation.
Experiments on the OS-World benchmark demonstrate that our fine-tuned local
model outperforms existing baselines, highlighting a promising path toward
private, efficient, and generalizable GUI agents.

Conclusion: 该工作通过结合检索的模板保真度与扩散的创造力，为音乐驱动舞蹈生成建立了新范式。

Abstract: Generating long-term, coherent, and realistic music-conditioned dance
sequences remains a challenging task in human motion synthesis. Existing
approaches exhibit critical limitations: motion graph methods rely on fixed
template libraries, restricting creative generation; diffusion models, while
capable of producing novel motions, often lack temporal coherence and musical
alignment. To address these challenges, we propose $\textbf{MotionRAG-Diff}$, a
hybrid framework that integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with
diffusion-based refinement to enable high-quality, musically coherent dance
generation for arbitrary long-term music inputs. Our method introduces three
core innovations: (1) A cross-modal contrastive learning architecture that
aligns heterogeneous music and dance representations in a shared latent space,
establishing unsupervised semantic correspondence without paired data; (2) An
optimized motion graph system for efficient retrieval and seamless
concatenation of motion segments, ensuring realism and temporal coherence
across long sequences; (3) A multi-condition diffusion model that jointly
conditions on raw music signals and contrastive features to enhance motion
quality and global synchronization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MotionRAG-Diff achieves state-of-the-art performance in motion quality,
diversity, and music-motion synchronization accuracy. This work establishes a
new paradigm for music-driven dance generation by synergizing retrieval-based
template fidelity with diffusion-based creative enhancement.

Abstract: This paper critically evaluates the applicability of the Project Management
Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) Guide framework to Artificial Intelligence (AI)
software projects, highlighting key limitations and proposing tailored
adaptations. Unlike traditional projects, AI initiatives rely heavily on
complex data, iterative experimentation, and specialized expertise while
navigating significant ethical considerations. Our analysis identifies gaps in
the PMBOK Guide, including its limited focus on data management, insufficient
support for iterative development, and lack of guidance on ethical and
multidisciplinary challenges. To address these deficiencies, we recommend
integrating data lifecycle management, adopting iterative and AI project
management frameworks, and embedding ethical considerations within project
planning and execution. Additionally, we explore alternative approaches that
better align with AI's dynamic and exploratory nature. We aim to enhance
project management practices for AI software projects by bridging these gaps.

*Jeonghun Kang,Soonmok Kwon,Joonseok Lee,Byung-Hak Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DIAMOND是一种基于LLM的智能体，结合体育分析和自然语言推理，用于生成上下文感知的棒球比赛亮点摘要，显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法（如WPA或计算机视觉）无法捕捉比赛的策略深度和叙事价值，而人工处理成本高且不可扩展。

Method: DIAMOND结合了棒球统计指标（如Win Expectancy和WPA）与LLM模块，通过量化比赛重要性和上下文叙事价值来生成摘要。

Result: 在韩国棒球联赛的五场比赛中，DIAMOND的F1分数从42.9%（仅WPA）提升到84.8%，优于商业和统计基线。

Conclusion: DIAMOND展示了模块化、可解释的智能体框架在体育事件摘要中的潜力，尽管规模有限。

Abstract: Traditional approaches -- such as Win Probability Added (WPA)-based ranking
or computer vision-driven event detection -- can identify scoring plays but
often miss strategic depth, momentum shifts, and storyline progression. Manual
curation remains the gold standard but is resource-intensive and not scalable.
We introduce DIAMOND, an LLM-driven agent for context-aware baseball highlight
summarization that integrates structured sports analytics with natural language
reasoning. DIAMOND leverages sabermetric features -- Win Expectancy, WPA, and
Leverage Index -- to quantify play importance, while an LLM module enhances
selection based on contextual narrative value. This hybrid approach ensures
both quantitative rigor and qualitative richness, surpassing the limitations of
purely statistical or vision-based systems. Evaluated on five diverse Korean
Baseball Organization League games, DIAMOND improves F1-score from 42.9%
(WPA-only) to 84.8%, outperforming both commercial and statistical baselines.
Though limited in scale, our results highlight the potential of modular,
interpretable agent-based frameworks for event-level summarization in sports
and beyond.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了Minos-Corpus数据集和Minos模型，用于多模态生成任务的评估，结合人类和GPT数据，在T2I任务上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究忽视T2I任务评估能力和大规模人类评估数据的整合，需填补这一空白。

Method: 提出Minos-Corpus数据集，结合人类和GPT数据；采用Data Selection and Balance、Mix-SFT训练方法及DPO技术开发Minos模型。

Result: Minos在T2I任务评估中超越所有开源和闭源模型，并在多任务平均评估性能上达到同类最佳。

Conclusion: 高质量人类评估数据和I2T与T2I任务的联合训练对提升评估性能至关重要。

Abstract: Evaluation is important for multimodal generation tasks. With the rapid
progress of MLLMs, there is growing interest in applying MLLMs to build general
evaluation systems. However, existing work overlooks two aspects: (1) the
development of evaluation capabilities for text-to-image (T2I) generation task,
and (2) the incorporation of large-scale human evaluation data. In this paper,
we introduce Minos-Corpus, a large-scale multimodal evaluation dataset that
combines evaluation data from both human and GPT. The corpus contains
evaluation data across both image-to-text(I2T) and T2I generation tasks. Based
on this corpus, we propose Data Selection and Balance, Mix-SFT training
methods, and apply DPO to develop Minos, a multimodal evaluation model built
upon a 7B backbone. Minos achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance among
all open-source evaluation models of similar scale on the average of evaluation
performance on all tasks, and outperforms all open-source and closed-source
models on evaluation of T2I generation task. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the importance of leveraging high-quality human evaluation data and jointly
training on evaluation data from both I2T and T2I generation tasks.

### [178] [SemVink: Advancing VLMs' Semantic Understanding of Optical Illusions via Visual Global Thinking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02803)
*Sifan Li,Yujun Cai,Yiwei Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HC-Bench基准测试显示，视觉语言模型（VLMs）在检测隐藏内容（如光学幻觉或AI生成图像中的内容）时表现极差，准确率接近零。通过SemVink方法（简单缩放图像至低分辨率），模型准确率提升至99%以上，揭示了VLMs过度依赖高层语义的缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLMs在语义任务上表现出色，但在处理隐藏内容（如光学幻觉或AI生成图像）时表现不佳，这与人类本能能力形成鲜明对比。研究旨在揭示VLMs的局限性并提出改进方向。

Method: 引入HC-Bench基准测试（包含112张隐藏文本、物体和幻觉的图像），评估VLMs的表现。提出SemVink方法，通过将图像缩放至低分辨率（32-128像素）消除冗余视觉噪声。

Result: VLMs在HC-Bench上的准确率仅为0-5.36%，而SemVink方法将准确率提升至99%以上。

Conclusion: VLMs过度依赖高层语义，缺乏低层次视觉处理能力。研究呼吁开发结合多尺度处理的混合模型，以提升真实世界应用的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel in semantic tasks but falter at a core
human capability: detecting hidden content in optical illusions or AI-generated
images through perceptual adjustments like zooming. We introduce HC-Bench, a
benchmark of 112 images with hidden text, objects, and illusions, revealing
that leading VLMs achieve near-zero accuracy (0-5.36%)-even with explicit
prompting. Humans resolve such ambiguities instinctively, yet VLMs fail due to
an overreliance on high-level semantics. Strikingly, we propose SemVink
(Semantic Visual Thinking) by simply scaling images to low resolutions (32-128
pixels), which unlocks >99% accuracy by eliminating redundant visual noise.
This exposes a critical architectural flaw: VLMs prioritize abstract reasoning
over low-level visual operations crucial for real-world robustness. Our work
urges a shift toward hybrid models integrating multi-scale processing, bridging
the gap between computational vision and human cognition for applications in
medical imaging, security, and beyond.

TL;DR: GUI-Actor是一种基于视觉语言模型（VLM）的坐标无关GUI定位方法，通过注意力机制和验证器提升视觉定位性能，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于文本坐标生成的GUI视觉定位方法的局限性，如空间语义对齐弱、无法处理模糊监督目标以及视觉特征与坐标粒度不匹配的问题。

Method: 引入基于注意力的动作头，学习将专用<ACTOR>标记与相关视觉块标记对齐，并提出验证器选择最佳动作区域。

Result: 在多个GUI动作定位基准测试中表现优异，泛化能力更强，甚至超越更大规模模型。

Conclusion: GUI-Actor通过轻量级调整即可赋予VLM强大的视觉定位能力，同时保持其通用性。

Abstract: One of the principal challenges in building VLM-powered GUI agents is visual
grounding, i.e., localizing the appropriate screen region for action execution
based on both the visual content and the textual plans. Most existing work
formulates this as a text-based coordinate generation task. However, these
approaches suffer from several limitations: weak spatial-semantic alignment,
inability to handle ambiguous supervision targets, and a mismatch between the
dense nature of screen coordinates and the coarse, patch-level granularity of
visual features extracted by models like Vision Transformers. In this paper, we
propose GUI-Actor, a VLM-based method for coordinate-free GUI grounding. At its
core, GUI-Actor introduces an attention-based action head that learns to align
a dedicated <ACTOR> token with all relevant visual patch tokens, enabling the
model to propose one or more action regions in a single forward pass. In line
with this, we further design a grounding verifier to evaluate and select the
most plausible action region from the candidates proposed for action execution.
Extensive experiments show that GUI-Actor outperforms prior state-of-the-art
methods on multiple GUI action grounding benchmarks, with improved
generalization to unseen screen resolutions and layouts. Notably, GUI-Actor-7B
even surpasses UI-TARS-72B (38.1) on ScreenSpot-Pro, achieving scores of 40.7
with Qwen2-VL and 44.6 with Qwen2.5-VL as backbones. Furthermore, by
incorporating the verifier, we find that fine-tuning only the newly introduced
action head (~100M parameters for 7B model) while keeping the VLM backbone
frozen is sufficient to achieve performance comparable to previous
state-of-the-art models, highlighting that GUI-Actor can endow the underlying
VLM with effective grounding capabilities without compromising its
general-purpose strengths.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉的灵巧抓取转移新方法，通过Schrödinger Bridge框架实现不同形态机器人手之间的抓取意图转移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决不同形态机器人手之间抓取意图转移的问题，无需配对演示或特定手的模拟。

Method: 采用Schrödinger Bridge框架，通过分数和流匹配学习源和目标潜在抓取空间的映射，并结合物理约束成本函数。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能生成稳定且物理合理的抓取，具有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了异构机械手的语义抓取转移，将视觉抓取与概率生成建模结合。

Abstract: We propose a new approach to vision-based dexterous grasp translation, which
aims to transfer grasp intent across robotic hands with differing morphologies.
Given a visual observation of a source hand grasping an object, our goal is to
synthesize a functionally equivalent grasp for a target hand without requiring
paired demonstrations or hand-specific simulations. We frame this problem as a
stochastic transport between grasp distributions using the Schr\"odinger Bridge
formalism. Our method learns to map between source and target latent grasp
spaces via score and flow matching, conditioned on visual observations. To
guide this translation, we introduce physics-informed cost functions that
encode alignment in base pose, contact maps, wrench space, and manipulability.
Experiments across diverse hand-object pairs demonstrate our approach generates
stable, physically grounded grasps with strong generalization. This work
enables semantic grasp transfer for heterogeneous manipulators and bridges
vision-based grasping with probabilistic generative modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决基于学习的融合方法在硬件需求和复杂性上的局限性，同时保持高层融合方法的鲁棒性。

Method: 改进了Adapted Kalman Filter (AKF)，并提出了一种基于Transformer的高层对象融合方法HiLO。

Result: 在F1分数和平均IoU上分别提升了25.9和6.1个百分点，并在大规模真实数据集和跨域场景中验证了有效性。

Conclusion: HiLO方法在性能和通用性上表现优异，适用于自动驾驶中的环境感知任务。

Abstract: The fusion of sensor data is essential for a robust perception of the
environment in autonomous driving. Learning-based fusion approaches mainly use
feature-level fusion to achieve high performance, but their complexity and
hardware requirements limit their applicability in near-production vehicles.
High-level fusion methods offer robustness with lower computational
requirements. Traditional methods, such as the Kalman filter, dominate this
area. This paper modifies the Adapted Kalman Filter (AKF) and proposes a novel
transformer-based high-level object fusion method called HiLO. Experimental
results demonstrate improvements of $25.9$ percentage points in $\textrm{F}_1$
score and $6.1$ percentage points in mean IoU. Evaluation on a new large-scale
real-world dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.
Their generalizability is further validated by cross-domain evaluation between
urban and highway scenarios. Code, data, and models are available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Neural Rodrigues Operator的学习模块，用于增强神经网络对关节系统运动结构的理解，并设计了Rodrigues Network (RodriNet) 架构，在运动预测和模仿学习等任务中表现优于传统方法。


<details>

Motivation: 现有架构（如MLPs和Transformers）缺乏对关节系统运动结构的归纳偏置，限制了其在动作学习和预测中的表现。

Method: 提出了Neural Rodrigues Operator，一种可学习的广义前向运动学操作，并基于此设计了RodriNet架构。

Result: 在运动预测和模仿学习任务中，RodriNet表现显著优于传统架构，并在单图像3D手部重建中验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 将运动学先验整合到网络架构中，可以显著提升动作学习的效果。

Abstract: Understanding and predicting articulated actions is important in robot
learning. However, common architectures such as MLPs and Transformers lack
inductive biases that reflect the underlying kinematic structure of articulated
systems. To this end, we propose the Neural Rodrigues Operator, a learnable
generalization of the classical forward kinematics operation, designed to
inject kinematics-aware inductive bias into neural computation. Building on
this operator, we design the Rodrigues Network (RodriNet), a novel neural
architecture specialized for processing actions. We evaluate the expressivity
of our network on two synthetic tasks on kinematic and motion prediction,
showing significant improvements compared to standard backbones. We further
demonstrate its effectiveness in two realistic applications: (i) imitation
learning on robotic benchmarks with the Diffusion Policy, and (ii) single-image
3D hand reconstruction. Our results suggest that integrating structured
kinematic priors into the network architecture improves action learning in
various domains.
