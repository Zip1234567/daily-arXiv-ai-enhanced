### [1] [VSF: Simple, Efficient, and Effective Negative Guidance in Few-Step Image Generation Models By Value Sign Flip](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10931)
*Wenqi Guo,Shan Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VSF是一种简单高效的负向提示引导方法，通过翻转注意力值符号来抑制不需要的内容，在少步数扩散和流匹配模型中表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如CFG、NASA和NAG在负向提示引导方面存在不足，需要一种更有效的方法来动态抑制不需要的内容

Method: 通过翻转负向提示的注意力值符号来动态抑制不需要的内容，计算开销小，兼容MMDiT和交叉注意力架构

Result: 在复杂提示对数据集上验证，VSF在少步数模型中显著优于现有方法，在非少步数模型中甚至优于CFG，同时保持图像质量

Conclusion: VSF是一种高效且有效的负向提示引导方法，适用于静态图像和视频生成任务，计算开销小且易于集成

Abstract: We introduce Value Sign Flip (VSF), a simple and efficient method for
incorporating negative prompt guidance in few-step diffusion and flow-matching
image generation models. Unlike existing approaches such as classifier-free
guidance (CFG), NASA, and NAG, VSF dynamically suppresses undesired content by
flipping the sign of attention values from negative prompts. Our method
requires only small computational overhead and integrates effectively with
MMDiT-style architectures such as Stable Diffusion 3.5 Turbo, as well as
cross-attention-based models like Wan. We validate VSF on challenging datasets
with complex prompt pairs and demonstrate superior performance in both static
image and video generation tasks. Experimental results show that VSF
significantly improves negative prompt adherence compared to prior methods in
few-step models, and even CFG in non-few-step models, while maintaining
competitive image quality. Code and ComfyUI node are available in
https://github.com/weathon/VSF/tree/main.

### [2] [Mitigating Hallucinations in Multimodal LLMs via Object-aware Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20181)
*Alberto Compagnoni,Davide Caffagni,Nicholas Moratelli,Lorenzo Baraldi,Marcella Cornia,Rita Cucchiara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CHAIR-DPO方法通过利用CHAIR指标构建偏好数据，使用DPO直接偏好优化来减少多模态大语言模型的幻觉问题，在多个基准测试中有效降低了幻觉答案的数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)虽然在各种任务中表现出色，但存在严重的幻觉问题，即生成与视觉输入不符的答案。现有方法需要复杂的流程构建合成偏好数据，且往往依赖专有模型。

Method: 利用CHAIR指标（原本用于图像描述幻觉评估）来区分生成答案中的优胜者（无幻觉）和失败者（有幻觉）样本，然后使用直接偏好优化(DPO)对现成的MLLMs进行微调。

Result: CHAIR-DPO方法在多个幻觉基准测试中有效减少了幻觉答案的数量，证明了基于CHAIR奖励微调MLLMs的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种简单有效的解决方案，通过将幻觉问题视为对齐问题，利用现有指标构建偏好数据，成功降低了MLLMs的幻觉现象。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) emerge as a unified interface to
address a multitude of tasks, ranging from NLP to computer vision. Despite
showcasing state-of-the-art results in many benchmarks, a long-standing issue
is the tendency of MLLMs to hallucinate, that is to generate answers to the
user's query that are not reflected in the visual input. In this paper, we
address the problem of hallucinations as an alignment problem, seeking to steer
the MLLM so that it prefers generating content without hallucinations. In
contrast to recent approaches that require complicated pipelines to build
synthetic preference data for alignment training, often relying on proprietary
models, we capitalize on the well-known CHAIR metric, originally proposed to
gauge the degree of hallucinations in image captioning. Given a pair of
generated answers, we leverage CHAIR to distinguish winner and loser options
(i.e., non-hallucinated and hallucinated samples) and fine-tune off-the-shelf
MLLMs via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The resulting method, which we
refer to as CHAIR-DPO, effectively diminishes the amount of hallucinated
answers on several hallucination benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of
fine-tuning the MLLM with a CHAIR-based reward. Source code and trained models
are publicly available at https://github.com/aimagelab/CHAIR-DPO.

### [3] [SDiFL: Stable Diffusion-Driven Framework for Image Forgery Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20182)
*Yang Su,Shunquan Tan,Jiwu Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于Stable Diffusion多模态大模型，提出一种无需大量标注数据的图像伪造定位新方法，通过将伪造残差作为显式模态融入SD3的潜在空间，显著提升伪造检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像伪造定位方法严重依赖人工标注数据，难以跟上多模态大模型驱动的图像篡改技术发展速度，需要更高效准确的解决方案。

Method: 利用Stable Diffusion的多模态架构，将图像伪造残差（高频信号）作为显式模态融合到SD3的潜在空间中，同时保留原始图像的丰富语义信息。

Result: 在基准数据集上相比现有最优方法性能提升达12%，在训练时未见过的真实文档伪造和自然场景伪造图像上也表现出强大性能。

Conclusion: 该方法成功将SD的多模态生成和感知能力整合到图像取证框架中，为应对新兴图像篡改技术提供了有效解决方案，具有很好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Driven by the new generation of multi-modal large models, such as Stable
Diffusion (SD), image manipulation technologies have advanced rapidly, posing
significant challenges to image forensics. However, existing image forgery
localization methods, which heavily rely on labor-intensive and costly
annotated data, are struggling to keep pace with these emerging image
manipulation technologies. To address these challenges, we are the first to
integrate both image generation and powerful perceptual capabilities of SD into
an image forensic framework, enabling more efficient and accurate forgery
localization. First, we theoretically show that the multi-modal architecture of
SD can be conditioned on forgery-related information, enabling the model to
inherently output forgery localization results. Then, building on this
foundation, we specifically leverage the multimodal framework of Stable
DiffusionV3 (SD3) to enhance forgery localization performance.We leverage the
multi-modal processing capabilities of SD3 in the latent space by treating
image forgery residuals -- high-frequency signals extracted using specific
highpass filters -- as an explicit modality. This modality is fused into the
latent space during training to enhance forgery localization performance.
Notably, our method fully preserves the latent features extracted by SD3,
thereby retaining the rich semantic information of the input image.
Experimental results show that our framework achieves up to 12% improvements in
performance on widely used benchmarking datasets compared to current
state-of-the-art image forgery localization models. Encouragingly, the model
demonstrates strong performance on forensic tasks involving real-world document
forgery images and natural scene forging images, even when such data were
entirely unseen during training.

*Max Torop,Masih Eskandar,Nicholas Kurtansky,Jinyang Liu,Jochen Weber,Octavia Camps,Veronica Rotemberg,Jennifer Dy,Kivanc Kose*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究探索将多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）与定量属性相结合，以提高皮肤疾病诊断AI模型的可解释性，通过在SLICE-3D数据集上进行属性特定的图像检索案例研究来验证方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然AI模型在皮肤疾病诊断方面表现出色，但其预测的可解释性仍需大幅提升才能实际应用。研究旨在结合MLLMs的自然语言推理能力和定量属性的预测能力，为临床实践提供更可靠的辅助诊断工具。

Method: 采用多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）与定量属性相结合的方法，通过对MLLMs进行微调，使其能够从图像中预测病变相关属性值（如病变面积等），并在SLICE-3D数据集上进行属性特定的基于内容的图像检索案例研究。

Result: 研究证明MLLMs的嵌入空间可以有效地与定量属性进行关联，通过微调能够准确预测属性值，为模型预测提供了更好的可解释性基础。

Conclusion: MLLMs与定量属性的结合为提升AI皮肤疾病诊断模型的可解释性提供了有前景的途径，通过自然语言推理和定量概念基础的预测，有望推动AI辅助诊断在临床实践中的应用。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence models have demonstrated significant success in
diagnosing skin diseases, including cancer, showing the potential to assist
clinicians in their analysis. However, the interpretability of model
predictions must be significantly improved before they can be used in practice.
To this end, we explore the combination of two promising approaches: Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) and quantitative attribute usage. MLLMs offer a
potential avenue for increased interpretability, providing reasoning for
diagnosis in natural language through an interactive format. Separately, a
number of quantitative attributes that are related to lesion appearance (e.g.,
lesion area) have recently been found predictive of malignancy with high
accuracy. Predictions grounded as a function of such concepts have the
potential for improved interpretability. We provide evidence that MLLM
embedding spaces can be grounded in such attributes, through fine-tuning to
predict their values from images. Concretely, we evaluate this grounding in the
embedding space through an attribute-specific content-based image retrieval
case study using the SLICE-3D dataset.

### [5] [Enhancing Automatic Modulation Recognition With a Reconstruction-Driven Vision Transformer Under Limited Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20193)
*Hossein Ahmadi,Banafsheh Saffari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于Vision Transformer的统一框架，结合监督、自监督和重构目标，在少量标注数据下实现高效的自动调制识别


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动调制识别方法依赖大量标注数据或多阶段训练流程，限制了实际应用中的可扩展性和泛化能力

Method: 使用ViT编码器、轻量级卷积解码器和线性分类器，通过重构分支将增强信号映射回原始信号，在预训练中学习鲁棒特征，微调时使用部分标签监督

Result: 在RML2018.01A数据集上，低标签情况下优于监督CNN和ViT基线，仅用15-20%标注数据即可达到ResNet水平精度，在不同SNR级别下保持强性能

Conclusion: 该框架为自动调制识别提供了简单、可泛化且标签高效的解决方案

Abstract: Automatic modulation recognition (AMR) is critical for cognitive radio,
spectrum monitoring, and secure wireless communication. However, existing
solutions often rely on large labeled datasets or multi-stage training
pipelines, which limit scalability and generalization in practice. We propose a
unified Vision Transformer (ViT) framework that integrates supervised,
self-supervised, and reconstruction objectives. The model combines a ViT
encoder, a lightweight convolutional decoder, and a linear classifier; the
reconstruction branch maps augmented signals back to their originals, anchoring
the encoder to fine-grained I/Q structure. This strategy promotes robust,
discriminative feature learning during pretraining, while partial label
supervision in fine-tuning enables effective classification with limited
labels. On the RML2018.01A dataset, our approach outperforms supervised CNN and
ViT baselines in low-label regimes, approaches ResNet-level accuracy with only
15-20% labeled data, and maintains strong performance across varying SNR
levels. Overall, the framework provides a simple, generalizable, and
label-efficient solution for AMR.

### [6] [InfinityHuman: Towards Long-Term Audio-Driven Human](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20210)
*Xiaodi Li,Pan Xie,Yi Ren,Qijun Gan,Chen Zhang,Fangyuan Kong,Xiang Yin,Bingyue Peng,Zehuan Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfinityHuman是一个从粗到细的音频驱动人体动画框架，通过姿态引导的细化器生成高分辨率长视频，解决了身份漂移和手部运动失真问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频驱动人体动画方法存在错误累积导致身份漂移、颜色偏移和场景不稳定，且手部运动建模不佳，与音频对齐不准确

Method: 提出coarse-to-fine框架：首先生成音频同步表示，然后使用姿态引导细化器逐步优化为高分辨率长视频。利用解耦的姿态序列和初始帧作为视觉锚点减少漂移，并引入手部特定奖励机制

Result: 在EMTD和HDTF数据集上达到state-of-the-art性能，在视频质量、身份保持、手部准确性和唇部同步方面表现优异

Conclusion: InfinityHuman通过姿态引导和手部奖励机制有效解决了长视频生成中的漂移和手部失真问题，消融研究证实了各模块的有效性

Abstract: Audio-driven human animation has attracted wide attention thanks to its
practical applications. However, critical challenges remain in generating
high-resolution, long-duration videos with consistent appearance and natural
hand motions. Existing methods extend videos using overlapping motion frames
but suffer from error accumulation, leading to identity drift, color shifts,
and scene instability. Additionally, hand movements are poorly modeled,
resulting in noticeable distortions and misalignment with the audio. In this
work, we propose InfinityHuman, a coarse-to-fine framework that first generates
audio-synchronized representations, then progressively refines them into
high-resolution, long-duration videos using a pose-guided refiner. Since pose
sequences are decoupled from appearance and resist temporal degradation, our
pose-guided refiner employs stable poses and the initial frame as a visual
anchor to reduce drift and improve lip synchronization. Moreover, to enhance
semantic accuracy and gesture realism, we introduce a hand-specific reward
mechanism trained with high-quality hand motion data. Experiments on the EMTD
and HDTF datasets show that InfinityHuman achieves state-of-the-art performance
in video quality, identity preservation, hand accuracy, and lip-sync. Ablation
studies further confirm the effectiveness of each module. Code will be made
public.

### [7] [Spherical Vision Transformers for Audio-Visual Saliency Prediction in 360-Degree Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20221)
*Mert Cokelek,Halit Ozsoy,Nevrez Imamoglu,Cagri Ozcinar,Inci Ayhan,Erkut Erdem,Aykut Erdem*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了两种新的全向视频显著性预测模型SalViT360和SalViT360-AV，通过统一视觉-97d0视觉注意力机制和空间音频线索，在多个数据集上显著超过现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏全面的360度音视频显著性预测数据集，以及需要处理球面扭曲和空间音频集成的复杂性，研究者创建了YT360-EyeTracking数据集并开发新模型。

Method: 提出SalViT360（基于视觉Transformer的框架，包含球面几何感知的空时注意力层）和SalViT360-AV（在SalViT360基础上通过Transformer适配器集成音频输入）两种模型。

Result: 在YT360-EyeTracking等多个标准数据集上，SalViT360和SalViT360-AV显著超过现有方法，证明空间音频线索对全向视频显著性预测至关重要。

Conclusion: 集成空间音频线索在模型架构中对于准确预测全向视频显著性至关重要，新提出的模型为360度音视频注意力预测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Omnidirectional videos (ODVs) are redefining viewer experiences in virtual
reality (VR) by offering an unprecedented full field-of-view (FOV). This study
extends the domain of saliency prediction to 360-degree environments,
addressing the complexities of spherical distortion and the integration of
spatial audio. Contextually, ODVs have transformed user experience by adding a
spatial audio dimension that aligns sound direction with the viewer's
perspective in spherical scenes. Motivated by the lack of comprehensive
datasets for 360-degree audio-visual saliency prediction, our study curates
YT360-EyeTracking, a new dataset of 81 ODVs, each observed under varying
audio-visual conditions. Our goal is to explore how to utilize audio-visual
cues to effectively predict visual saliency in 360-degree videos. Towards this
aim, we propose two novel saliency prediction models: SalViT360, a
vision-transformer-based framework for ODVs equipped with spherical
geometry-aware spatio-temporal attention layers, and SalViT360-AV, which
further incorporates transformer adapters conditioned on audio input. Our
results on a number of benchmark datasets, including our YT360-EyeTracking,
demonstrate that SalViT360 and SalViT360-AV significantly outperform existing
methods in predicting viewer attention in 360-degree scenes. Interpreting these
results, we suggest that integrating spatial audio cues in the model
architecture is crucial for accurate saliency prediction in omnidirectional
videos. Code and dataset will be available at
https://cyberiada.github.io/SalViT360.

### [8] [A Novel Framework for Automated Explain Vision Model Using Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20227)
*Phu-Vinh Nguyen,Tan-Hanh Pham,Chris Ngo,Truong Son Hy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于VLM的视觉模型解释流程，能够在样本和数据集层面解释模型行为，发现失败案例并提升模型可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉模型研究主要关注性能指标(如准确率、IoU、mAP)，而忽视了可解释性。现有xAI方法多为单样本解释，缺乏能够在大规模数据集上揭示模型普遍行为的方法。

Method: 利用视觉-语言模型(VLM)构建了一种解释流程，能够同时在样本级别和数据集级别上解释视觉模型的行为。

Result: 该流程能够有效发现模型的失败案例，揭示模型的偏见和模式，以最小化的努力获得模型洞察。

Conclusion: 本文方法将视觉模型开发与xAI分析相结合，推进了图像分析领域的可解释性研究。

Abstract: The development of many vision models mainly focuses on improving their
performance using metrics such as accuracy, IoU, and mAP, with less attention
to explainability due to the complexity of applying xAI methods to provide a
meaningful explanation of trained models. Although many existing xAI methods
aim to explain vision models sample-by-sample, methods explaining the general
behavior of vision models, which can only be captured after running on a large
dataset, are still underexplored. Furthermore, understanding the behavior of
vision models on general images can be very important to prevent biased
judgments and help identify the model's trends and patterns. With the
application of Vision-Language Models, this paper proposes a pipeline to
explain vision models at both the sample and dataset levels. The proposed
pipeline can be used to discover failure cases and gain insights into vision
models with minimal effort, thereby integrating vision model development with
xAI analysis to advance image analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ATMS-KD框架通过自适应温度调度和混合样本增强，将MobileNetV3 Large教师模型的知识蒸馏到轻量级CNN学生模型中，在农业玫瑰成熟度分类任务上取得了优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对农业资源受限环境，需要开发轻量级CNN模型来实现高效的计算机视觉应用，传统直接训练方法效果有限，需要更有效的知识蒸馏技术。

Method: 提出ATMS-KD框架，结合自适应温度调度和混合样本增强技术，使用MobileNetV3 Large作为教师模型，训练三种不同规模的轻量级残差CNN学生模型。

Result: 所有学生模型验证准确率超过96.7%，紧凑模型达到97.11%准确率，比第二名方法提升1.60个百分点，推理延迟仅72.19ms，知识保留率超过99%。

Conclusion: ATMS-KD框架在农业计算机视觉任务中表现出色，能够有效实现知识转移，为资源受限环境提供了高效的轻量级模型解决方案。

Abstract: This study proposes ATMS-KD (Adaptive Temperature and Mixed-Sample Knowledge
Distillation), a novel framework for developing lightweight CNN models suitable
for resource-constrained agricultural environments. The framework combines
adaptive temperature scheduling with mixed-sample augmentation to transfer
knowledge from a MobileNetV3 Large teacher model (5.7\,M parameters) to
lightweight residual CNN students. Three student configurations were evaluated:
Compact (1.3\,M parameters), Standard (2.4\,M parameters), and Enhanced (3.8\,M
parameters). The dataset used in this study consists of images of \textit{Rosa
damascena} (Damask rose) collected from agricultural fields in the Dades Oasis,
southeastern Morocco, providing a realistic benchmark for agricultural computer
vision applications under diverse environmental conditions. Experimental
evaluation on the Damascena rose maturity classification dataset demonstrated
significant improvements over direct training methods. All student models
achieved validation accuracies exceeding 96.7\% with ATMS-KD compared to
95--96\% with direct training. The framework outperformed eleven established
knowledge distillation methods, achieving 97.11\% accuracy with the compact
model -- a 1.60 percentage point improvement over the second-best approach
while maintaining the lowest inference latency of 72.19\,ms. Knowledge
retention rates exceeded 99\% for all configurations, demonstrating effective
knowledge transfer regardless of student model capacity.

*Mutahar Safdar,Gentry Wood,Max Zimmermann,Guy Lamouche,Priti Wanjara,Yaoyao Fiona Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合视觉语言表示和专家知识的微结构质量评估框架，实现零样本分类，无需重新训练模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业制造中先进材料的快速可靠质量评估存在瓶颈，特别是对于非传统增材制造产生的异质结构

Method: 集成深度语义分割与预训练多模态模型(CLIP和FLAVA)，开发定制化的基于相似性表示，结合专家标注的正负参考样本

Result: 在增材制造金属基复合材料数据集上验证，能够区分合格和有缺陷样品，FLAVA模型视觉敏感性更高，CLIP模型与文本标准更一致

Conclusion: 该方法通过促进原始数据与专家知识间的语义互操作性，为工程信息学中的可扩展和领域适应性质量评估策略做出贡献

Abstract: Rapid and reliable qualification of advanced materials remains a bottleneck
in industrial manufacturing, particularly for heterogeneous structures produced
via non-conventional additive manufacturing processes. This study introduces a
novel framework that links microstructure informatics with a range of expert
characterization knowledge using customized and hybrid vision-language
representations (VLRs). By integrating deep semantic segmentation with
pre-trained multi-modal models (CLIP and FLAVA), we encode both visual
microstructural data and textual expert assessments into shared
representations. To overcome limitations in general-purpose embeddings, we
develop a customized similarity-based representation that incorporates both
positive and negative references from expert-annotated images and their
associated textual descriptions. This allows zero-shot classification of
previously unseen microstructures through a net similarity scoring approach.
Validation on an additively manufactured metal matrix composite dataset
demonstrates the framework's ability to distinguish between acceptable and
defective samples across a range of characterization criteria. Comparative
analysis reveals that FLAVA model offers higher visual sensitivity, while the
CLIP model provides consistent alignment with the textual criteria. Z-score
normalization adjusts raw unimodal and cross-modal similarity scores based on
their local dataset-driven distributions, enabling more effective alignment and
classification in the hybrid vision-language framework. The proposed method
enhances traceability and interpretability in qualification pipelines by
enabling human-in-the-loop decision-making without task-specific model
retraining. By advancing semantic interoperability between raw data and expert
knowledge, this work contributes toward scalable and domain-adaptable
qualification strategies in engineering informatics.

*Jeong Hun Yeo,Hyeongseop Rha,Sungjune Park,Junil Won,Yong Man Ro*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了首个统一框架，能够处理手语、唇语和音频的多种组合，用于生成口语文本，在多个任务上达到或超越最先进模型性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语音识别系统对聋哑人士不可访问，而现有的视觉替代方案（手语和唇读）往往被孤立研究，缺乏统一的处理框架

Method: 设计统一的模态无关架构，处理异质输入；探索模态间协同作用，特别是唇部运动作为手语理解的非手动线索；实现与专业模型相当或更优的性能

Result: 在SLT、VSR、ASR和AVSR任务上达到或超越最先进模型性能；明确建模唇部运动作为独立模态显著提升SLT性能

Conclusion: 统一框架成功整合多种模态，证明了模态间协同作用的重要性，特别是唇部运动对手语理解的增强作用

Abstract: Audio is the primary modality for human communication and has driven the
success of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technologies. However, such
systems remain inherently inaccessible to individuals who are deaf or hard of
hearing. Visual alternatives such as sign language and lip reading offer
effective substitutes, and recent advances in Sign Language Translation (SLT)
and Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) have improved audio-less communication.
Yet, these modalities have largely been studied in isolation, and their
integration within a unified framework remains underexplored. In this paper, we
introduce the first unified framework capable of handling diverse combinations
of sign language, lip movements, and audio for spoken-language text generation.
We focus on three main objectives: (i) designing a unified, modality-agnostic
architecture capable of effectively processing heterogeneous inputs; (ii)
exploring the underexamined synergy among modalities, particularly the role of
lip movements as non-manual cues in sign language comprehension; and (iii)
achieving performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art models
specialized for individual tasks. Building on this framework, we achieve
performance on par with or better than task-specific state-of-the-art models
across SLT, VSR, ASR, and AVSR. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that
explicitly modeling lip movements as a separate modality significantly improves
SLT performance.

TL;DR: 使用MedNeXt-L-k5模型进行自动化软脚背空间分割，在T2加权MRI上达到领先性能，但在T1加权MRI上性能较低，且未超过nnU-Net。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手工分割软脚背空间耗时且可靠性中等，现有自动化深度学习模型性能中等且稀缺跨数据集的泛化能力。

Method: 适配MedNeXt-L-k5（Transformer受启发的3D编码器-解码器卷积网络）进行自动PVS分割，训练两个模型：一个使用均质HCP-Aging T2w数据集，另一个使用异质T1w数据集。评估方法包括5折交叉验证和留一地点交叉验证。

Result: 在T2w图像上达到符合评分者可靠性的Dice分数0.88±0.06（白质），为文献最高。T1w图像上仅获0.58±0.09（白质）。跨地点验证显示性能下降，但聚簇级别Dice分数仍保持在0.61-0.62范围。

Conclusion: MedNeXt-L-k5提供了一种高效的软脚背空间自动分割方案，但Transformer受启发的全局上下文注意机制并非PVS分割高准确性的必需条件，因为它未能超过nnU-Net。

Abstract: Enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS) are increasingly recognized as biomarkers
of cerebral small vessel disease, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and
aging-related neurodegeneration. However, manual segmentation of PVS is
time-consuming and subject to moderate inter-rater reliability, while existing
automated deep learning models have moderate performance and typically fail to
generalize across diverse clinical and research MRI datasets. We adapted
MedNeXt-L-k5, a Transformer-inspired 3D encoder-decoder convolutional network,
for automated PVS segmentation. Two models were trained: one using a
homogeneous dataset of 200 T2-weighted (T2w) MRI scans from the Human
Connectome Project-Aging (HCP-Aging) dataset and another using 40 heterogeneous
T1-weighted (T1w) MRI volumes from seven studies across six scanners. Model
performance was evaluated using internal 5-fold cross validation (5FCV) and
leave-one-site-out cross validation (LOSOCV). MedNeXt-L-k5 models trained on
the T2w images of the HCP-Aging dataset achieved voxel-level Dice scores of
0.88+/-0.06 (white matter, WM), comparable to the reported inter-rater
reliability of that dataset, and the highest yet reported in the literature.
The same models trained on the T1w images of the HCP-Aging dataset achieved a
substantially lower Dice score of 0.58+/-0.09 (WM). Under LOSOCV, the model had
voxel-level Dice scores of 0.38+/-0.16 (WM) and 0.35+/-0.12 (BG), and
cluster-level Dice scores of 0.61+/-0.19 (WM) and 0.62+/-0.21 (BG).
MedNeXt-L-k5 provides an efficient solution for automated PVS segmentation
across diverse T1w and T2w MRI datasets. MedNeXt-L-k5 did not outperform the
nnU-Net, indicating that the attention-based mechanisms present in
transformer-inspired models to provide global context are not required for high
accuracy in PVS segmentation.

Motivation: 尽管在大规模自然图像数据集上预训练的基础模型为医学图像分割提供了强大范式，但如何有效迁移其学习表示以用于精确临床应用仍然是一个挑战。

Method: 提出Dino U-Net架构，使用冻结的DINOv3骨干网络作为编码器，配备专门适配器融合语义特征和空间细节，设计保真度感知投影模块(FAPM)在降维过程中保持特征质量。

Result: 在七个不同的公共医学图像分割数据集上进行广泛实验，Dino U-Net实现了最先进的性能，在各种成像模态上始终优于先前方法，并且随着骨干模型规模增大（最高达70亿参数），分割精度持续提升。

Conclusion: 利用通用基础模型的优越密集预训练特征，为提升医学图像分割精度提供了一种高效且参数效率高的方法。

Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained on large-scale natural image datasets offer a
powerful paradigm for medical image segmentation. However, effectively
transferring their learned representations for precise clinical applications
remains a challenge. In this work, we propose Dino U-Net, a novel
encoder-decoder architecture designed to exploit the high-fidelity dense
features of the DINOv3 vision foundation model. Our architecture introduces an
encoder built upon a frozen DINOv3 backbone, which employs a specialized
adapter to fuse the model's rich semantic features with low-level spatial
details. To preserve the quality of these representations during dimensionality
reduction, we design a new fidelity-aware projection module (FAPM) that
effectively refines and projects the features for the decoder. We conducted
extensive experiments on seven diverse public medical image segmentation
datasets. Our results show that Dino U-Net achieves state-of-the-art
performance, consistently outperforming previous methods across various imaging
modalities. Our framework proves to be highly scalable, with segmentation
accuracy consistently improving as the backbone model size increases up to the
7-billion-parameter variant. The findings demonstrate that leveraging the
superior, dense-pretrained features from a general-purpose foundation model
provides a highly effective and parameter-efficient approach to advance the
accuracy of medical image segmentation. The code is available at

*Zhixiang Chi,Yanan Wu,Li Gu,Huan Liu,Ziqiang Wang,Yang Zhang,Yang Wang,Konstantinos N. Plataniotis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种训练免费、反馈驱动的自适应框架，通过将输出级的补丁级对应关系反馈到中间注意力机制中，增强CLIP在开放词汇分割中的空间一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP在视觉-文本对齐方面表现强劲，但在开放词汇分割中由于定位能力差而表现不佳。先前的方法通过修改中间注意力来增强空间一致性，但由于后续操作（如投影）导致这种一致性无法持续传播到最终输出，且中间注意力缺乏与文本表示的直接交互。

Method: 设计了一个训练免费的自适应框架，包括注意力隔离、基于置信度的稀疏适应剪枝和适应集成等关键模块，将输出预测作为更强的空间一致性先验反馈到中间注意力层。

Result: 该方法作为即插即用模块，无缝集成到四种最先进方法和三种骨干网络（ViT-B、ViT-L、ViT-H）中，在八个基准测试中 consistently 提升性能。

Conclusion: 通过利用输出级的语义一致性作为反馈信号，有效解决了CLIP在开放词汇分割中的空间一致性问题，显著提升了分割性能。

Abstract: CLIP exhibits strong visual-textual alignment but struggle with
open-vocabulary segmentation due to poor localization. Prior methods enhance
spatial coherence by modifying intermediate attention. But, this coherence
isn't consistently propagated to the final output due to subsequent operations
such as projections. Additionally, intermediate attention lacks direct
interaction with text representations, such semantic discrepancy limits the
full potential of CLIP.
  In this work, we propose a training-free, feedback-driven self-adaptive
framework that adapts output-based patch-level correspondences back to the
intermediate attention. The output predictions, being the culmination of the
model's processing, encapsulate the most comprehensive visual and textual
semantics about each patch. Our approach enhances semantic consistency between
internal representations and final predictions by leveraging the model's
outputs as a stronger spatial coherence prior. We design key modules, including
attention isolation, confidence-based pruning for sparse adaptation, and
adaptation ensemble, to effectively feedback the output coherence cues. Our
method functions as a plug-in module, seamlessly integrating into four
state-of-the-art approaches with three backbones (ViT-B, ViT-L, ViT-H). We
further validate our framework across multiple attention types (Q-K, self-self,
and Proxy augmented with MAE, SAM, and DINO). Our approach consistently
improves their performance across eight benchmarks.

### [15] [How Multimodal LLMs Solve Image Tasks: A Lens on Visual Grounding, Task Reasoning, and Answer Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20279)
*Zhuoran Yu,Yong Jae Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个探测框架来系统分析多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在不同层处理视觉和文本输入的方式，发现模型存在一致的阶段性结构：早期层进行视觉基础处理，中间层支持词汇整合和语义推理，最终层准备任务特定输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多模态大语言模型在各种视觉语言任务上表现出色，但其内部处理动态仍未被充分探索，需要系统分析模型如何处理视觉和文本输入。

Method: 训练线性分类器从每层提取的token嵌入预测细粒度视觉类别，使用标准化锚点问题，并在三种提示变体下评估：词汇变体、语义否定变体和输出格式变体。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5、LLaVA-Next-LLaMA-3和Qwen2-VL模型中发现一致的阶段性结构，整体结构在不同视觉标记化、指令调优数据和预训练语料变化下保持稳定，但具体层分配随基础LLM架构变化而显著改变。

Conclusion: 该研究为MLLMs的层级组织提供了统一视角，并提供了轻量级、模型无关的方法来分析多模态表示动态。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong performance
across a wide range of vision-language tasks, yet their internal processing
dynamics remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce a probing framework
to systematically analyze how MLLMs process visual and textual inputs across
layers. We train linear classifiers to predict fine-grained visual categories
(e.g., dog breeds) from token embeddings extracted at each layer, using a
standardized anchor question. To uncover the functional roles of different
layers, we evaluate these probes under three types of controlled prompt
variations: (1) lexical variants that test sensitivity to surface-level
changes, (2) semantic negation variants that flip the expected answer by
modifying the visual concept in the prompt, and (3) output format variants that
preserve reasoning but alter the answer format. Applying our framework to
LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-Next-LLaMA-3, and Qwen2-VL, we identify a consistent
stage-wise structure in which early layers perform visual grounding, middle
layers support lexical integration and semantic reasoning, and final layers
prepare task-specific outputs. We further show that while the overall
stage-wise structure remains stable across variations in visual tokenization,
instruction tuning data, and pretraining corpus, the specific layer allocation
to each stage shifts notably with changes in the base LLM architecture. Our
findings provide a unified perspective on the layer-wise organization of MLLMs
and offer a lightweight, model-agnostic approach for analyzing multimodal
representation dynamics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出SLiCS方法，通过监督字典学习将视觉-语言联合嵌入空间分解为多个概念特定的线性子空间，实现更精确的概念过滤图像检索和条件生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言联合嵌入空间（如CLIP）包含丰富的语义信息，但缺乏对复杂场景内容的解耦表示。作者假设可以通过将嵌入分解为多个概念特定的分量向量来实现空间解耦。

Method: 采用监督字典学习方法，估计一个线性合成模型，包含稀疏、非负的字典向量组合。通过新颖的交替优化算法优化组结构字典，并利用文本联合嵌入找到语义上有意义的描述。

Result: SLiCS方法在多个嵌入空间（CLIP、TiTok、DINOv2）上都实现了更精确的概念过滤图像检索，定量和定性结果均显示性能提升。

Conclusion: 稀疏线性概念子空间能够有效解耦嵌入空间，为概念过滤的图像检索和条件生成提供更精确的表示，该方法具有通用性，可应用于不同类型的嵌入表示。

Abstract: Vision-language co-embedding networks, such as CLIP, provide a latent
embedding space with semantic information that is useful for downstream tasks.
We hypothesize that the embedding space can be disentangled to separate the
information on the content of complex scenes by decomposing the embedding into
multiple concept-specific component vectors that lie in different subspaces. We
propose a supervised dictionary learning approach to estimate a linear
synthesis model consisting of sparse, non-negative combinations of groups of
vectors in the dictionary (atoms), whose group-wise activity matches the
multi-label information. Each concept-specific component is a non-negative
combination of atoms associated to a label. The group-structured dictionary is
optimized through a novel alternating optimization with guaranteed convergence.
Exploiting the text co-embeddings, we detail how semantically meaningful
descriptions can be found based on text embeddings of words best approximated
by a concept's group of atoms, and unsupervised dictionary learning can exploit
zero-shot classification of training set images using the text embeddings of
concept labels to provide instance-wise multi-labels. We show that the
disentangled embeddings provided by our sparse linear concept subspaces (SLiCS)
enable concept-filtered image retrieval (and conditional generation using
image-to-prompt) that is more precise. We also apply SLiCS to highly-compressed
autoencoder embeddings from TiTok and the latent embedding from self-supervised
DINOv2. Quantitative and qualitative results highlight the improved precision
of the concept-filtered image retrieval for all embeddings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedFoundationHub是一个图形化工具包，旨在解决医疗视觉语言模型(VLMs)在临床应用中面临的安全隐私问题，提供无需编程的模型选择、即插即用部署和隐私保护推理功能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗视觉语言模型虽然为临床应用带来巨大机遇，但存在严重的隐私安全风险，包括受保护健康信息(PHI)泄露、数据泄漏和网络攻击漏洞等问题，特别是在医院环境中尤为关键。

Method: 开发了MedFoundationHub图形用户界面工具包，支持医生无需编程专业知识即可手动选择使用不同模型，工程师可以即插即用方式高效部署医疗VLMs，并通过Docker编排实现操作系统无关的隐私保护推理部署。

Result: 使用单块NVIDIA A6000 GPU的离线本地工作站，评估了5个最先进的VLM模型(Google-MedGemma3-4B等)，通过1015次临床医生-模型评分事件发现模型存在离题回答、模糊推理和病理学术语不一致等重复性限制。

Conclusion: MedFoundationHub提供了一个安全、易用的医疗VLM部署解决方案，能够在典型学术研究实验室资源条件下实现隐私保护的模型推理，同时揭示了当前医疗VLMs在实际临床应用中仍需改进的局限性。

Abstract: Recent advances in medical vision-language models (VLMs) open up remarkable
opportunities for clinical applications such as automated report generation,
copilots for physicians, and uncertainty quantification. However, despite their
promise, medical VLMs introduce serious security concerns, most notably risks
of Protected Health Information (PHI) exposure, data leakage, and vulnerability
to cyberthreats - which are especially critical in hospital environments. Even
when adopted for research or non-clinical purposes, healthcare organizations
must exercise caution and implement safeguards. To address these challenges, we
present MedFoundationHub, a graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit that: (1)
enables physicians to manually select and use different models without
programming expertise, (2) supports engineers in efficiently deploying medical
VLMs in a plug-and-play fashion, with seamless integration of Hugging Face
open-source models, and (3) ensures privacy-preserving inference through
Docker-orchestrated, operating system agnostic deployment. MedFoundationHub
requires only an offline local workstation equipped with a single NVIDIA A6000
GPU, making it both secure and accessible within the typical resources of
academic research labs. To evaluate current capabilities, we engaged
board-certified pathologists to deploy and assess five state-of-the-art VLMs
(Google-MedGemma3-4B, Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, and
LLaVA-1.5-7B/13B). Expert evaluation covered colon cases and renal cases,
yielding 1015 clinician-model scoring events. These assessments revealed
recurring limitations, including off-target answers, vague reasoning, and
inconsistent pathology terminology.

TL;DR: 提出双向交互Mamba(BIM)模型，通过双向交互扫描和多尺度扫描机制，在保持线性复杂度的同时实现多任务密集预测中的充分跨任务交互


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多任务密集预测中充分跨任务交互与计算效率之间的权衡问题，现有方法往往需要在交互完整性和计算效率之间做出妥协

Method: 采用Bidirectional Interaction Scan(BI-Scan)机制构建任务特定的双向序列表示，结合任务优先和位置优先扫描模式；使用Multi-Scale Scan(MS-Scan)机制实现多粒度场景建模

Result: 在NYUD-V2和PASCAL-Context两个基准测试上表现出优于最先进竞争方法的性能

Conclusion: BIM模型通过创新的扫描机制成功解决了多任务密集预测中的交互效率问题，在保持线性复杂度的同时实现了充分的跨任务信息交互

Abstract: Sufficient cross-task interaction is crucial for success in multi-task dense
prediction. However, sufficient interaction often results in high computational
complexity, forcing existing methods to face the trade-off between interaction
completeness and computational efficiency. To address this limitation, this
work proposes a Bidirectional Interaction Mamba (BIM), which incorporates novel
scanning mechanisms to adapt the Mamba modeling approach for multi-task dense
prediction. On the one hand, we introduce a novel Bidirectional Interaction
Scan (BI-Scan) mechanism, which constructs task-specific representations as
bidirectional sequences during interaction. By integrating task-first and
position-first scanning modes within a unified linear complexity architecture,
BI-Scan efficiently preserves critical cross-task information. On the other
hand, we employ a Multi-Scale Scan~(MS-Scan) mechanism to achieve
multi-granularity scene modeling. This design not only meets the diverse
granularity requirements of various tasks but also enhances nuanced cross-task
feature interactions. Extensive experiments on two challenging benchmarks,
\emph{i.e.}, NYUD-V2 and PASCAL-Context, show the superiority of our BIM vs its
state-of-the-art competitors.

Motivation: 现有的文本导向编辑方法在复杂场景中面临描述不充分的问题，需要额外的非文本编辑提示来提供更丰富的信息。

Method: 利用预训练的多模态编码器，通过减少音频编码空间与去噪模型提示编码空间的差异来集成多样化音频。同时提出分离噪声分支和适应性补丁选择来处理复杂多模态编辑提示。

Result: 在多样化编辑任务上的综合实验表明，该框架能够通过融合音频的丰富信息来处理复杂编辑场景，而仅依靠文本的方法无法完成。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种无需训练的音频导航视觉编辑方案，能够有效处理复杂的多模态编辑需求，充分利用音频信息来补充文本提示的不足。

Abstract: Visual editing with diffusion models has made significant progress but often
struggles with complex scenarios that textual guidance alone could not
adequately describe, highlighting the need for additional non-text editing
prompts. In this work, we introduce a novel audio-guided visual editing
framework that can handle complex editing tasks with multiple text and audio
prompts without requiring additional training. Existing audio-guided visual
editing methods often necessitate training on specific datasets to align audio
with text, limiting their generalization to real-world situations. We leverage
a pre-trained multi-modal encoder with strong zero-shot capabilities and
integrate diverse audio into visual editing tasks, by alleviating the
discrepancy between the audio encoder space and the diffusion model's prompt
encoder space. Additionally, we propose a novel approach to handle complex
scenarios with multiple and multi-modal editing prompts through our separate
noise branching and adaptive patch selection. Our comprehensive experiments on
diverse editing tasks demonstrate that our framework excels in handling
complicated editing scenarios by incorporating rich information from audio,
where text-only approaches fail.

Result: 在四个标准数据集上进行了广泛实验，证明该框架显著提高了多标签分类性能，达到了最先进水平。

Conclusion: 该研究有效解决了单正样本多标签学习中的噪声问题，通过新的损失函数和动态伪标签技术，实现了更准确的分类效果。

Abstract: Multi-label learning is a challenging computer vision task that requires
assigning multiple categories to each image. However, fully annotating
large-scale datasets is often impractical due to high costs and effort,
motivating the study of learning from partially annotated data. In the extreme
case of Single Positive Multi-Label Learning (SPML), each image is provided
with only one positive label, while all other labels remain unannotated.
Traditional SPML methods that treat missing labels as unknown or negative tend
to yield inaccuracies and false negatives, and integrating various
pseudo-labeling strategies can introduce additional noise. To address these
challenges, we propose the Generalized Pseudo-Label Robust Loss (GPR Loss), a
novel loss function that effectively learns from diverse pseudo-labels while
mitigating noise. Complementing this, we introduce a simple yet effective
Dynamic Augmented Multi-focus Pseudo-labeling (DAMP) technique. Together, these
contributions form the Adaptive and Efficient Vision-Language Pseudo-Labeling
(AEVLP) framework. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our framework significantly advances multi-label classification, achieving
state-of-the-art results.

Motivation: 当前ANN-SNN转换方法在分类任务中表现优异，但在视觉检测任务中性能不佳，主要原因是异质脉冲模式导致的残留膜电位问题

Method: 采用延迟脉冲方法缓解异质脉冲模式问题，提出时间依赖性IF神经元(tdIF)，使神经元能够根据时间步长的时序动态调整积累和发射行为

Result: 在目标检测和车道线检测两个关键视觉任务上，该方法超越了当前ANN-SNN转换方法，在超低延迟(5个时间步内)下达到最先进性能

Conclusion: tdIF神经元使脉冲具有不同的时间特性而不仅仅是频率表示，在保持与传统IF神经元相同能耗的同时，实现了更精确的特征表示和超低延迟的高性能视觉检测

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by the brain, are characterized by
minimal power consumption and swift inference capabilities on neuromorphic
hardware, and have been widely applied to various visual perception tasks.
Current ANN-SNN conversion methods have achieved excellent results in
classification tasks with ultra-low time-steps, but their performance in visual
detection tasks remains suboptimal. In this paper, we propose a delay-spike
approach to mitigate the issue of residual membrane potential caused by
heterogeneous spiking patterns. Furthermore, we propose a novel
temporal-dependent Integrate-and-Fire (tdIF) neuron architecture for SNNs. This
enables Integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons to dynamically adjust their
accumulation and firing behaviors based on the temporal order of time-steps.
Our method enables spikes to exhibit distinct temporal properties, rather than
relying solely on frequency-based representations. Moreover, the tdIF neuron
maintains energy consumption on par with traditional IF neuron. We demonstrate
that our method achieves more precise feature representation with lower
time-steps, enabling high performance and ultra-low latency in visual detection
tasks. In this study, we conduct extensive evaluation of the tdIF method across
two critical vision tasks: object detection and lane line detection. The
results demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses current ANN-SNN
conversion approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance with ultra-low
latency (within 5 time-steps).

Motivation: 现有显著目标检测方法在复杂场景中容易丢失细节、边缘模糊，且单模态信息融合不足，需要提升对小结构、边缘区域检测精度和多模态协同能力。

Method: 设计动态不确定性图卷积模块(DUGC)通过空间语义距离构建稀疏图传播不确定性；提出多模态协同融合策略(MCF)使用可学习模态门控权重融合RGB、深度和边缘特征；采用多尺度BCE和IoU损失、跨尺度一致性约束和不确定性引导监督机制优化检测性能。

Conclusion: DUP-MCRNet通过动态不确定性传播和多模态协同推理有效提升了显著目标检测的性能，特别是在细节保持和边缘清晰度方面取得了显著改进。

Abstract: In view of the problems that existing salient object detection (SOD) methods
are prone to losing details, blurring edges, and insufficient fusion of
single-modal information in complex scenes, this paper proposes a dynamic
uncertainty propagation and multimodal collaborative reasoning network
(DUP-MCRNet). Firstly, a dynamic uncertainty graph convolution module (DUGC) is
designed to propagate uncertainty between layers through a sparse graph
constructed based on spatial semantic distance, and combined with channel
adaptive interaction, it effectively improves the detection accuracy of small
structures and edge regions. Secondly, a multimodal collaborative fusion
strategy (MCF) is proposed, which uses learnable modality gating weights to
weightedly fuse the attention maps of RGB, depth, and edge features. It can
dynamically adjust the importance of each modality according to different
scenes, effectively suppress redundant or interfering information, and
strengthen the semantic complementarity and consistency between
cross-modalities, thereby improving the ability to identify salient regions
under occlusion, weak texture or background interference. Finally, the
detection performance at the pixel level and region level is optimized through
multi-scale BCE and IoU loss, cross-scale consistency constraints, and
uncertainty-guided supervision mechanisms. Extensive experiments show that
DUP-MCRNet outperforms various SOD methods on most common benchmark datasets,
especially in terms of edge clarity and robustness to complex backgrounds. Our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/YukiBear426/DUP-MCRNet.

Conclusion: 利用多尺度图像特征生成多尺度BEV特征的方法能有效解决多视角行人检测中的尺度变化问题，显著提升检测精度

Abstract: Multi-View Pedestrian Detection (MVPD) aims to detect pedestrians in the form
of a bird's eye view (BEV) from multi-view images. In MVPD, end-to-end
trainable deep learning methods have progressed greatly. However, they often
struggle to detect pedestrians with consistently small or large scales in views
or with vastly different scales between views. This is because they do not
exploit multi-scale image features to generate the BEV feature and detect
pedestrians. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel MVPD method, called
Multi-Scale Multi-View Detection (MSMVD). MSMVD generates multi-scale BEV
features by projecting multi-scale image features extracted from individual
views into the BEV space, scale-by-scale. Each of these BEV features inherits
the properties of its corresponding scale image features from multiple views.
Therefore, these BEV features help the precise detection of pedestrians with
consistently small or large scales in views. Then, MSMVD combines information
at different scales of multiple views by processing the multi-scale BEV
features using a feature pyramid network. This improves the detection of
pedestrians with vastly different scales between views. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that exploiting multi-scale image features via multi-scale BEV
features greatly improves the detection performance, and MSMVD outperforms the
previous highest MODA by $4.5$ points on the GMVD dataset.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of real-time deepfake generation techniques,
forged content is becoming increasingly realistic and widespread across
applications like video conferencing and social media. Although
state-of-the-art detectors achieve high accuracy on standard benchmarks, their
heavy computational cost hinders real-time deployment in practical
applications. To address this, we propose the Spatial-Frequency Aware
Multi-Scale Fusion Network (SFMFNet), a lightweight yet effective architecture
for real-time deepfake detection. We design a spatial-frequency hybrid aware
module that jointly leverages spatial textures and frequency artifacts through
a gated mechanism, enhancing sensitivity to subtle manipulations. A
token-selective cross attention mechanism enables efficient multi-level feature
interaction, while a residual-enhanced blur pooling structure helps retain key
semantic cues during downsampling. Experiments on several benchmark datasets
show that SFMFNet achieves a favorable balance between accuracy and efficiency,
with strong generalization and practical value for real-time applications.

Conclusion: 结合双模型权重选择和自知识蒸馏的方法能够有效克服传统方法在紧凑模型中保留关键信息的局限性

Abstract: We propose a novel medical image classification method that integrates
dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation (SKD). In
real-world medical settings, deploying large-scale models is often limited by
computational resource constraints, which pose significant challenges for their
practical implementation. Thus, developing lightweight models that achieve
comparable performance to large-scale models while maintaining computational
efficiency is crucial. To address this, we employ a dual-model weight selection
strategy that initializes two lightweight models with weights derived from a
large pretrained model, enabling effective knowledge transfer. Next, SKD is
applied to these selected models, allowing the use of a broad range of initial
weight configurations without imposing additional excessive computational cost,
followed by fine-tuning for the target classification tasks. By combining
dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation, our method
overcomes the limitations of conventional approaches, which often fail to
retain critical information in compact models. Extensive experiments on
publicly available datasets-chest X-ray images, lung computed tomography scans,
and brain magnetic resonance imaging scans-demonstrate the superior performance
and robustness of our approach compared to existing methods.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种高效的LiDAR点云压缩方法FastPCC，通过几何重密化和跨尺度特征传播模块，实现了高压缩比和实时性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高精度LiDAR扫描产生大量数据，存储和传输成本高。现有方法在极端稀疏的几何细节上上下文建模效率低，限制了压缩性能和速度。

Method: 提出两个轻量模块：1）几何重密化模块：对编码后的稀疏几何进行重密化，在更密集尺度提取特征，然后重新稀疏化用于预测编码；2）跨尺度特征传播模块：利用多分辨率占位线索引导层次特征传播。

Result: 在KITTI数据集上实现了独创性的压缩比和实时性能，在12位量化下编码解码均达26 FPS。

Conclusion: 通过生成紧凑特征表示实现了高效的上下文建模和加速编码过程，为LiDAR点云压缩提供了高性能解决方案。

Abstract: LiDAR point clouds are fundamental to various applications, yet
high-precision scans incur substantial storage and transmission overhead.
Existing methods typically convert unordered points into hierarchical octree or
voxel structures for dense-to-sparse predictive coding. However, the extreme
sparsity of geometric details hinders efficient context modeling, thereby
limiting their compression performance and speed. To address this challenge, we
propose to generate compact features for efficient predictive coding. Our
framework comprises two lightweight modules. First, the Geometry
Re-Densification Module re-densifies encoded sparse geometry, extracts features
at denser scale, and then re-sparsifies the features for predictive coding.
This module avoids costly computation on highly sparse details while
maintaining a lightweight prediction head. Second, the Cross-scale Feature
Propagation Module leverages occupancy cues from multiple resolution levels to
guide hierarchical feature propagation. This design facilitates information
sharing across scales, thereby reducing redundant feature extraction and
providing enriched features for the Geometry Re-Densification Module. By
integrating these two modules, our method yields a compact feature
representation that provides efficient context modeling and accelerates the
coding process. Experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art
compression ratios and real-time performance, achieving 26 FPS for both
encoding and decoding at 12-bit quantization. Code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出Droplet3D方法，利用视频数据中的常识先验来解决3D生成中的数据稀缺问题，通过构建大规模多视角视频数据集和生成模型，实现了空间一致且语义合理的3D内容生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D领域面临数据稀缺问题，相比文本和图像，互联网上的3D数据量较少。视频数据包含丰富的空间一致性先验和语义信息，可以作为替代监督信号来缓解3D生成的泛化瓶颈。

Method: 构建Droplet3D-4M数据集（首个大规模多视角标注视频数据集），训练Droplet3D生成模型，支持图像和密集文本输入，利用视频中的空间一致性和语义先验进行3D生成。

Result: 实验验证了方法的有效性，能够生成空间一致且语义合理的3D内容。相比主流3D解决方案，该方法还展现出扩展到场景级应用的潜力。

Conclusion: 视频中的常识先验显著促进了3D创作，所有资源（数据集、代码、技术框架和模型权重）均已开源。

Abstract: Scaling laws have validated the success and promise of large-data-trained
models in creative generation across text, image, and video domains. However,
this paradigm faces data scarcity in the 3D domain, as there is far less of it
available on the internet compared to the aforementioned modalities.
Fortunately, there exist adequate videos that inherently contain commonsense
priors, offering an alternative supervisory signal to mitigate the
generalization bottleneck caused by limited native 3D data. On the one hand,
videos capturing multiple views of an object or scene provide a spatial
consistency prior for 3D generation. On the other hand, the rich semantic
information contained within the videos enables the generated content to be
more faithful to the text prompts and semantically plausible. This paper
explores how to apply the video modality in 3D asset generation, spanning
datasets to models. We introduce Droplet3D-4M, the first large-scale video
dataset with multi-view level annotations, and train Droplet3D, a generative
model supporting both image and dense text input. Extensive experiments
validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its ability to
produce spatially consistent and semantically plausible content. Moreover, in
contrast to the prevailing 3D solutions, our approach exhibits the potential
for extension to scene-level applications. This indicates that the commonsense
priors from the videos significantly facilitate 3D creation. We have
open-sourced all resources including the dataset, code, technical framework,
and model weights: https://dropletx.github.io/.

Motivation: 自动驾驶系统需要大量corner cases进行训练验证，但真实世界收集成本高且危险。现有3D高斯溅射和图像生成方法存在视觉保真度有限和姿态控制不精确的问题

Method: 使用编辑对象的3D高斯表示作为密集先验注入去噪过程，采用场景级3D边界框布局重建非目标对象的遮挡区域，并引入层次化细粒度特征指导外观细节

Conclusion: 该方法为自动驾驶系统提供了高质量的场景编辑解决方案，同时有利于下游数据驱动任务

Abstract: Corner cases are crucial for training and validating autonomous driving
systems, yet collecting them from the real world is often costly and hazardous.
Editing objects within captured sensor data offers an effective alternative for
generating diverse scenarios, commonly achieved through 3D Gaussian Splatting
or image generative models. However, these approaches often suffer from limited
visual fidelity or imprecise pose control. To address these issues, we propose
G^2Editor, a framework designed for photorealistic and precise object editing
in driving videos. Our method leverages a 3D Gaussian representation of the
edited object as a dense prior, injected into the denoising process to ensure
accurate pose control and spatial consistency. A scene-level 3D bounding box
layout is employed to reconstruct occluded areas of non-target objects.
Furthermore, to guide the appearance details of the edited object, we
incorporate hierarchical fine-grained features as additional conditions during
generation. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that G^2Editor
effectively supports object repositioning, insertion, and deletion within a
unified framework, outperforming existing methods in both pose controllability
and visual quality, while also benefiting downstream data-driven tasks.

TL;DR: 通过病理知识基础的域随机化策略，从健康数据生成合成脑部变异数据，解决稀缺病理标注数据的问题，实现了对胆肢体发育不良病例的高精度脑部分割和生物标记提取。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胆肢体发育不良(CCD)等稀缺病理导致标注数据极其稀缺，使得深度学习模型难以泛化，影响膝胎脑部分割的准确性和临床应用。

Method: 提出病理知识基础的域随机化策略，将CCD表现的先验知识嵌入合成数据生成流程。仅从健康数据模拟多样的脑部变异，无需病理标注即可实现稳健分割。

Result: 在248例健康膝胎、26例CCD病例和47例其他脑部病理的组织中验证，在CCD病例上取得显著改善，同时保持对健康和其他病理的性能。胆肢体长度估计错误从10.9mm降至0.7mm，拓扑学一致性提升。

Conclusion: 将领域特定的解剖先验知识集成到合成数据流程中，可有效缓解数据稀缺问题，提升对稀缺但临床重要病变的分析能力。

Abstract: Accurate fetal brain segmentation is crucial for extracting biomarkers and
assessing neurodevelopment, especially in conditions such as corpus callosum
dysgenesis (CCD), which can induce drastic anatomical changes. However, the
rarity of CCD severely limits annotated data, hindering the generalization of
deep learning models. To address this, we propose a pathology-informed domain
randomization strategy that embeds prior knowledge of CCD manifestations into a
synthetic data generation pipeline. By simulating diverse brain alterations
from healthy data alone, our approach enables robust segmentation without
requiring pathological annotations.
  We validate our method on a cohort comprising 248 healthy fetuses, 26 with
CCD, and 47 with other brain pathologies, achieving substantial improvements on
CCD cases while maintaining performance on both healthy fetuses and those with
other pathologies. From the predicted segmentations, we derive clinically
relevant biomarkers, such as corpus callosum length (LCC) and volume, and show
their utility in distinguishing CCD subtypes. Our pathology-informed
augmentation reduces the LCC estimation error from 1.89 mm to 0.80 mm in
healthy cases and from 10.9 mm to 0.7 mm in CCD cases. Beyond these
quantitative gains, our approach yields segmentations with improved topological
consistency relative to available ground truth, enabling more reliable
shape-based analyses. Overall, this work demonstrates that incorporating
domain-specific anatomical priors into synthetic data pipelines can effectively
mitigate data scarcity and enhance analysis of rare but clinically significant
malformations.

Method: 提出强化多轮推理框架，迭代选择视频片段并基于先前处理片段的理解进行渐进推理；引入门控双级奖励系统，结合轨迹级答案正确性和轮级帧-查询相关性奖励。

Result: 在VideoMME、MLVU和EgoSchema等基准测试中，Video-MTR在准确性和效率方面均优于现有方法，达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: Video-MTR通过多轮迭代推理和双级奖励系统，有效解决了长视频理解问题，无需外部VLM支持，实现了端到端训练和优越性能，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Long-form video understanding, characterized by long-range temporal
dependencies and multiple events, remains a challenge. Existing methods often
rely on static reasoning or external visual-language models (VLMs), which face
issues like complexity and sub-optimal performance due to the lack of
end-to-end training. In this paper, we propose Video-MTR, a reinforced
multi-turn reasoning framework designed to enable iterative key video segment
selection and question comprehension. Unlike traditional video reasoning
pipeline, which generate predictions in a single turn, Video-MTR performs
reasoning in multiple turns, selecting video segments progressively based on
the evolving understanding of previously processed segments and the current
question. This iterative process allows for a more refined and contextually
aware analysis of the video. To ensure intermediate reasoning process, we
introduce a novel gated bi-level reward system, combining trajectory-level
rewards based on answer correctness and turn-level rewards emphasizing
frame-query relevance. This system optimizes both video segment selection and
question comprehension, eliminating the need for external VLMs and allowing
end-to-end training. Extensive experiments on benchmarks like VideoMME, MLVU,
and EgoSchema demonstrate that Video-MTR outperforms existing methods in both
accuracy and efficiency, advancing the state-of-the-art in long video
understanding.

TL;DR: DUO是首个针对单目3D目标检测的双重不确定性优化TTA框架，通过联合最小化语义不确定性和几何不确定性，提升模型在域偏移下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TTA方法虽然认识到低不确定性与高泛化能力的正相关关系，但未能解决M3OD中固有的双重不确定性问题：语义不确定性（模糊类别预测）和几何不确定性（不稳定空间定位）。

Method: 提出双重不确定性优化(DUO)框架：1)通过凸优化视角创新性地推导出焦点损失的凸结构，开发无监督版本实现标签无关的不确定性加权；2)设计语义感知法向场约束，在语义清晰的区域保持几何一致性；3)建立双分支互补机制，空间感知提升语义分类，语义预测优化空间理解。

Result: 在多个数据集和域偏移类型上的广泛实验表明，DUO优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DUO通过联合优化语义和几何双重不确定性，显著提升了单目3D目标检测在域偏移下的鲁棒性和可靠性。

Abstract: Accurate monocular 3D object detection (M3OD) is pivotal for safety-critical
applications like autonomous driving, yet its reliability deteriorates
significantly under real-world domain shifts caused by environmental or sensor
variations. To address these shifts, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods have
emerged, enabling models to adapt to target distributions during inference.
While prior TTA approaches recognize the positive correlation between low
uncertainty and high generalization ability, they fail to address the dual
uncertainty inherent to M3OD: semantic uncertainty (ambiguous class
predictions) and geometric uncertainty (unstable spatial localization). To
bridge this gap, we propose Dual Uncertainty Optimization (DUO), the first TTA
framework designed to jointly minimize both uncertainties for robust M3OD.
Through a convex optimization lens, we introduce an innovative convex structure
of the focal loss and further derive a novel unsupervised version, enabling
label-agnostic uncertainty weighting and balanced learning for high-uncertainty
objects. In parallel, we design a semantic-aware normal field constraint that
preserves geometric coherence in regions with clear semantic cues, reducing
uncertainty from the unstable 3D representation. This dual-branch mechanism
forms a complementary loop: enhanced spatial perception improves semantic
classification, and robust semantic predictions further refine spatial
understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DUO over
existing methods across various datasets and domain shift types.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to more studies to enhance golfers'
shot precision. However, these existing studies have not quantitatively
established the relationship between swing posture and ball trajectory,
limiting their ability to provide golfers with the necessary insights for swing
improvement. In this paper, we propose a new dataset called CaddieSet, which
includes joint information and various ball information from a single shot.
CaddieSet extracts joint information from a single swing video by segmenting it
into eight swing phases using a computer vision-based approach. Furthermore,
based on expert golf domain knowledge, we define 15 key metrics that influence
a golf swing, enabling the interpretation of swing outcomes through
swing-related features. Through experiments, we demonstrated the feasibility of
CaddieSet for predicting ball trajectories using various benchmarks. In
particular, we focus on interpretable models among several benchmarks and
verify that swing feedback using our joint features is quantitatively
consistent with established domain knowledge. This work is expected to offer
new insight into golf swing analysis for both academia and the sports industry.

Result: 在MVTec 3D-AD数据集上达到新的state-of-the-art，显著降低了误报率

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了3D异常检测中多模态融合的挑战，具有工业部署的实用价值

Abstract: Surface anomaly detection is pivotal for ensuring product quality in
industrial manufacturing. While 2D image-based methods have achieved remarkable
success, 3D point cloud-based detection remains underexplored despite its
richer geometric cues. We argue that the key bottleneck is the absence of
powerful pretrained foundation backbones in 3D comparable to those in 2D. To
bridge this gap, we propose Importance-Aware Ensemble Network (IAENet), an
ensemble framework that synergizes 2D pretrained expert with 3D expert models.
However, naively fusing predictions from disparate sources is non-trivial:
existing strategies can be affected by a poorly performing modality and thus
degrade overall accuracy. To address this challenge, We introduce an novel
Importance-Aware Fusion (IAF) module that dynamically assesses the contribution
of each source and reweights their anomaly scores. Furthermore, we devise
critical loss functions that explicitly guide the optimization of IAF, enabling
it to combine the collective knowledge of the source experts but also preserve
their unique strengths, thereby enhancing the overall performance of anomaly
detection. Extensive experiments on MVTec 3D-AD demonstrate that our IAENet
achieves a new state-of-the-art with a markedly lower false positive rate,
underscoring its practical value for industrial deployment.

Conclusion: DescriptiveEdit通过重新定义编辑任务为基于参考图像的文本到图像生成，克服了指令数据集质量限制，具有更好的可扩展性和生成能力。

Abstract: Despite the progress in text-to-image generation, semantic image editing
remains a challenge. Inversion-based algorithms unavoidably introduce
reconstruction errors, while instruction-based models mainly suffer from
limited dataset quality and scale. To address these problems, we propose a
descriptive-prompt-based editing framework, named DescriptiveEdit. The core
idea is to re-frame `instruction-based image editing' as `reference-image-based
text-to-image generation', which preserves the generative power of well-trained
Text-to-Image models without architectural modifications or inversion.
Specifically, taking the reference image and a prompt as input, we introduce a
Cross-Attentive UNet, which newly adds attention bridges to inject reference
image features into the prompt-to-edit-image generation process. Owing to its
text-to-image nature, DescriptiveEdit overcomes limitations in instruction
dataset quality, integrates seamlessly with ControlNet, IP-Adapter, and other
extensions, and is more scalable. Experiments on the Emu Edit benchmark show it
improves editing accuracy and consistency.

Motivation: 在无法访问源域数据的情况下，现有方法依赖模型预测生成伪标签，但伪标签质量无法保证且存在错误累积问题，需要新的解决方案。

Method: 使用双分类器将目标数据的整体特征表示解耦为语义相关特征和域相关特征，保持子特征与整体特征的一致性，并通过自适应阈值和置信度评分进行加权自监督学习。

Result: 在CIFAR10-C、CIFAR100-C和ImageNet-C等多个数据集上的广泛实验验证了该方法的有效性，在持续测试时适应场景中表现出稳定的性能。

Conclusion: DCFS框架通过特征解耦和一致性约束，结合置信度感知学习，有效解决了伪标签噪声和错误累积问题，提升了持续测试时适应的性能。

Abstract: Continual test-time adaptation aims to continuously adapt a pre-trained model
to a stream of target domain data without accessing source data. Without access
to source domain data, the model focuses solely on the feature characteristics
of the target data. Relying exclusively on these features can lead to confusion
and introduce learning biases. Currently, many existing methods generate
pseudo-labels via model predictions. However, the quality of pseudo-labels
cannot be guaranteed and the problem of error accumulation must be solved. To
address these challenges, we propose DCFS, a novel CTTA framework that
introduces dual-path feature consistency and confidence-aware sample learning.
This framework disentangles the whole feature representation of the target data
into semantic-related feature and domain-related feature using dual classifiers
to learn distinct feature representations. By maintaining consistency between
the sub-features and the whole feature, the model can comprehensively capture
data features from multiple perspectives. Additionally, to ensure that the
whole feature information of the target domain samples is not overlooked, we
set a adaptive threshold and calculate a confidence score for each sample to
carry out loss weighted self-supervised learning, effectively reducing the
noise of pseudo-labels and alleviating the problem of error accumulation. The
efficacy of our proposed method is validated through extensive experimentation
across various datasets, including CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, and ImageNet-C,
demonstrating consistent performance in continual test-time adaptation
scenarios.

Method: 提出使用3DGS模型进行相机标定精细调整的方法，通过对相机参数进行新视角色彩损失的反向传播优化

Result: 在3DGS参考数据集上，新的标定方法带来平均0.4 dB PSNR的提升

Conclusion: 虽然精细调整可能耗时较长，但对于像Mip-NeRF 360这样的参考场景标定，新视角质量的提升是最重要的，因此该方法具有重要价值

Abstract: The quality of the camera calibration is of major importance for evaluating
progresses in novel view synthesis, as a 1-pixel error on the calibration has a
significant impact on the reconstruction quality. While there is no ground
truth for real scenes, the quality of the calibration is assessed by the
quality of the novel view synthesis. This paper proposes to use a 3DGS model to
fine tune calibration by backpropagation of novel view color loss with respect
to the cameras parameters. The new calibration alone brings an average
improvement of 0.4 dB PSNR on the dataset used as reference by 3DGS. The fine
tuning may be long and its suitability depends on the criticity of training
time, but for calibration of reference scenes, such as Mip-NeRF 360, the stake
of novel view quality is the most important.

Abstract: Accurate gross tumor volume segmentation on multi-modal medical data is
critical for radiotherapy planning in nasopharyngeal carcinoma and
glioblastoma. Recent advances in deep neural networks have brought promising
results in medical image segmentation, leading to an increasing demand for
labeled data. Since labeling medical images is time-consuming and
labor-intensive, active learning has emerged as a solution to reduce annotation
costs by selecting the most informative samples to label and adapting
high-performance models with as few labeled samples as possible. Previous
active domain adaptation (ADA) methods seek to minimize sample redundancy by
selecting samples that are farthest from the source domain. However, such
one-off selection can easily cause negative transfer, and access to source
medical data is often limited. Moreover, the query strategy for multi-modal
medical data remains unexplored. In this work, we propose an active and
sequential domain adaptation framework for dynamic multi-modal sample selection
in ADA. We derive a query strategy to prioritize labeling and training on the
most valuable samples based on their informativeness and representativeness.
Empirical validation on diverse gross tumor volume segmentation tasks
demonstrates that our method achieves favorable segmentation performance,
significantly outperforming state-of-the-art ADA methods. Code is available at

Abstract: Existing LiDAR-based 3D object detectors typically rely on manually annotated
labels for training to achieve good performance. However, obtaining
high-quality 3D labels is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this
issue, recent works explore unsupervised 3D object detection by introducing RGB
images as an auxiliary modal to assist pseudo-box generation. However, these
methods simply integrate pseudo-boxes generated by LiDAR point clouds and RGB
images. Yet, such a label-level fusion strategy brings limited improvements to
the quality of pseudo-boxes, as it overlooks the complementary nature in terms
of LiDAR and RGB image data. To overcome the above limitations, we propose a
novel data-level fusion framework that integrates RGB images and LiDAR data at
an early stage. Specifically, we utilize vision foundation models for instance
segmentation and depth estimation on images and introduce a bi-directional
fusion method, where real points acquire category labels from the 2D space,
while 2D pixels are projected onto 3D to enhance real point density. To
mitigate noise from depth and segmentation estimations, we propose a local and
global filtering method, which applies local radius filtering to suppress depth
estimation errors and global statistical filtering to remove
segmentation-induced outliers. Furthermore, we propose a data-level fusion
based dynamic self-evolution strategy, which iteratively refines pseudo-boxes
under a dense representation, significantly improving localization accuracy.
Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that the detector
trained by our method significantly outperforms that trained by previous
state-of-the-art methods with 28.4$\%$ mAP on the nuScenes validation

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在远程医疗或紧急情况下，传统BMI测量方法不可用或不切实际时，需要从相机图像中快速评估体重指数。现有计算机视觉方法受限于较小的数据集规模。

Method: 使用WayBED数据集（84,963张图像），通过姿势聚类和人物检测的自动过滤方法去除低质量图像，保留71,322张高质量图像训练深度学习模型。使用CLAID框架在Android设备上部署完整管道。

Result: 在WayBED测试集上达到7.9%的MAPE（文献中最低值），在未见VisualBodyToBMI数据集上达到13%的MAPE（与最先进方法相当），微调后在该数据集上达到8.56%的MAPE（最低报告值）。

Conclusion: 该方法在大规模数据集上训练，实现了最先进的BMI估计性能，具有良好的泛化能力，并提供了完整的开源代码和移动部署方案，为实际应用提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Estimating Body Mass Index (BMI) from camera images with machine learning
models enables rapid weight assessment when traditional methods are unavailable
or impractical, such as in telehealth or emergency scenarios. Existing computer
vision approaches have been limited to datasets of up to 14,500 images. In this
study, we present a deep learning-based BMI estimation method trained on our
WayBED dataset, a large proprietary collection of 84,963 smartphone images from
25,353 individuals. We introduce an automatic filtering method that uses
posture clustering and person detection to curate the dataset by removing
low-quality images, such as those with atypical postures or incomplete views.
This process retained 71,322 high-quality images suitable for training. We
achieve a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 7.9% on our hold-out test
set (WayBED data) using full-body images, the lowest value in the published
literature to the best of our knowledge. Further, we achieve a MAPE of 13% on
the completely unseen~(during training) VisualBodyToBMI dataset, comparable
with state-of-the-art approaches trained on it, demonstrating robust
generalization. Lastly, we fine-tune our model on VisualBodyToBMI and achieve a
MAPE of 8.56%, the lowest reported value on this dataset so far. We deploy the
full pipeline, including image filtering and BMI estimation, on Android devices
using the CLAID framework. We release our complete code for model training,
filtering, and the CLAID package for mobile deployment as open-source
contributions.

TL;DR: 本研究通过557个模拟实验，系统评估了7种主流域适应技术在自然和医学图像分类中的表现，发现DSAN算法在COVID-19等医学数据集上表现优异，准确率达91.2%，在动态数据流场景中相比基线提升6.7%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有域适应技术研究多基于自然图像，医学图像领域研究较少，且主流数据集可能导致性能偏差。需要系统评估域适应技术在自然和医学图像中的实际效果。

Method: 使用7种广泛应用的域适应技术，在5个自然图像和8个医学图像数据集上进行557个模拟实验，涵盖分布外、动态数据流和有限训练样本等多种场景。

Result: DSAN算法表现突出，在COVID-19数据集上达到91.2%的分类准确率，在动态数据流场景中相比基线提升6.7%。DSAN在COVID-19和皮肤癌数据集上展现出良好的可解释性。

Conclusion: 研究结果深化了对域适应技术的理解，为模型在医学数据上的有效适应提供了宝贵见解，DSAN算法在医学图像分类中具有显著优势。

Abstract: Domain adaptation (DA) techniques have the potential in machine learning to
alleviate distribution differences between training and test sets by leveraging
information from source domains. In image classification, most advances in DA
have been made using natural images rather than medical data, which are harder
to work with. Moreover, even for natural images, the use of mainstream datasets
can lead to performance bias. {With the aim of better understanding the
benefits of DA for both natural and medical images, this study performs 557
simulation studies using seven widely-used DA techniques for image
classification in five natural and eight medical datasets that cover various
scenarios, such as out-of-distribution, dynamic data streams, and limited
training samples.} Our experiments yield detailed results and insightful
observations highlighting the performance and medical applicability of these
techniques. Notably, our results have shown the outstanding performance of the
Deep Subdomain Adaptation Network (DSAN) algorithm. This algorithm achieved
feasible classification accuracy (91.2\%) in the COVID-19 dataset using
Resnet50 and showed an important accuracy improvement in the dynamic data
stream DA scenario (+6.7\%) compared to the baseline. Our results also
demonstrate that DSAN exhibits remarkable level of explainability when
evaluated on COVID-19 and skin cancer datasets. These results contribute to the
understanding of DA techniques and offer valuable insight into the effective
adaptation of models to medical data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频目标检测面临运动模糊、遮挡等图像退化问题，现有方法通过特征聚合和复杂后处理提升性能但计算成本高，需要在不增加推理负担的情况下提高鲁棒性

Method: 引入对比学习辅助分支(CLAB)，使用对比损失增强主干网络特征表示能力；提出动态损失权重策略，训练早期侧重辅助特征学习，后期逐渐侧重检测任务

Result: 在ImageNet VID数据集上，使用ResNet-101达到84.0% mAP，ResNeXt-101达到85.2% mAP，实现了CNN模型的最先进性能，无需额外后处理方法

Conclusion: CLAB方法有效提升了视频目标检测的性能，通过对比学习和动态权重策略增强了特征表示能力，在不增加推理计算成本的情况下实现了state-of-the-art性能

Abstract: Video object detection is a challenging task because videos often suffer from
image deterioration such as motion blur, occlusion, and deformable shapes,
making it significantly more difficult than detecting objects in still images.
Prior approaches have improved video object detection performance by employing
feature aggregation and complex post-processing techniques, though at the cost
of increased computational demands. To improve robustness to image degradation
without additional computational load during inference, we introduce a
straightforward yet effective Contrastive Learning through Auxiliary Branch
(CLAB) method. First, we implement a constrastive auxiliary branch using a
contrastive loss to enhance the feature representation capability of the video
object detector's backbone. Next, we propose a dynamic loss weighting strategy
that emphasizes auxiliary feature learning early in training while gradually
prioritizing the detection task as training converges. We validate our approach
through comprehensive experiments and ablation studies, demonstrating
consistent performance gains. Without bells and whistles, CLAB reaches a
performance of 84.0% mAP and 85.2% mAP with ResNet-101 and ResNeXt-101,
respectively, on the ImageNet VID dataset, thus achieving state-of-the-art
performance for CNN-based models without requiring additional post-processing
methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文分析了CLIP视觉编码器在排版攻击下的行为，发现特定注意力头负责提取排版信息，并提出无需微调的选择性消融防御方法，显著提升模型对抗排版攻击的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 排版攻击通过向图像中注入文本来操纵多模态系统，导致目标错误分类、恶意内容生成和视觉语言模型越狱。需要研究CLIP模型在此类攻击下的行为并开发有效防御方法。

Method: 定位CLIP模型后半层中专用于提取和传输排版信息的注意力头，通过选择性消融这些注意力头组成的排版电路来防御攻击，无需微调。

Result: 在ImageNet-100的排版变体上性能提升高达19.6%，标准ImageNet-100准确率下降不到1%。无需训练的方法与依赖微调的最先进防御方法竞争力相当。

Conclusion: 发布了一系列抗排版攻击的鲁棒CLIP模型（dyslexic CLIP），可作为安全关键应用的即插即用替代方案，在文本识别效用与文本操纵风险之间取得更好平衡。

Abstract: Typographic attacks exploit multi-modal systems by injecting text into
images, leading to targeted misclassifications, malicious content generation
and even Vision-Language Model jailbreaks. In this work, we analyze how CLIP
vision encoders behave under typographic attacks, locating specialized
attention heads in the latter half of the model's layers that causally extract
and transmit typographic information to the cls token. Building on these
insights, we introduce a method to defend CLIP models against typographic
attacks by selectively ablating a typographic circuit, consisting of attention
heads. Without requiring finetuning, our method improves performance by up to
19.6% on a typographic variant of ImageNet-100, while reducing standard
ImageNet-100 accuracy by less than 1%. Notably, our training-free approach
remains competitive with current state-of-the-art typographic defenses that
rely on finetuning. To this end, we release a family of dyslexic CLIP models
which are significantly more robust against typographic attacks. These models
serve as suitable drop-in replacements for a broad range of safety-critical
applications, where the risks of text-based manipulation outweigh the utility
of text recognition.

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) is a crucial task in computer vision with
wide range of applications including human computer interaction, surveillance,
and assistive technologies. However, challenges such as occlusion, expression
variability, and lack of interpretability hinder the performance of traditional
FER systems. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a powerful alternative by
modeling relational dependencies between facial landmarks, enabling structured
and interpretable learning. In this paper, we propose GLaRE, a novel
Graph-based Landmark Region Embedding network for emotion recognition. Facial
landmarks are extracted using 3D facial alignment, and a quotient graph is
constructed via hierarchical coarsening to preserve spatial structure while
reducing complexity. Our method achieves 64.89 percentage accuracy on AffectNet
and 94.24 percentage on FERG, outperforming several existing baselines.
Additionally, ablation studies have demonstrated that region-level embeddings
from quotient graphs have contributed to improved prediction performance.

Method: 提出FastFit框架，采用半注意力机制和用类别嵌入替代传统时间步嵌入，完全解耦参考特征编码与去噪过程，实现参考特征的单次计算和跨步骤无损重用。

Conclusion: FastFit成功解决了多参考虚拟试穿的效率和功能限制问题，通过创新的缓存架构实现了高速高质量的虚拟试穿效果，为复杂多参考虚拟试穿研究提供了新的解决方案和数据集支持。

Abstract: Despite its great potential, virtual try-on technology is hindered from
real-world application by two major challenges: the inability of current
methods to support multi-reference outfit compositions (including garments and
accessories), and their significant inefficiency caused by the redundant
re-computation of reference features in each denoising step. To address these
challenges, we propose FastFit, a high-speed multi-reference virtual try-on
framework based on a novel cacheable diffusion architecture. By employing a
Semi-Attention mechanism and substituting traditional timestep embeddings with
class embeddings for reference items, our model fully decouples reference
feature encoding from the denoising process with negligible parameter overhead.
This allows reference features to be computed only once and losslessly reused
across all steps, fundamentally breaking the efficiency bottleneck and
achieving an average 3.5x speedup over comparable methods. Furthermore, to
facilitate research on complex, multi-reference virtual try-on, we introduce
DressCode-MR, a new large-scale dataset. It comprises 28,179 sets of
high-quality, paired images covering five key categories (tops, bottoms,
dresses, shoes, and bags), constructed through a pipeline of expert models and
human feedback refinement. Extensive experiments on the VITON-HD, DressCode,
and our DressCode-MR datasets show that FastFit surpasses state-of-the-art
methods on key fidelity metrics while offering its significant advantage in
inference efficiency.

Conclusion: UTA-Sign通过融合热成像和事件相机两种模态，有效解决了低光照环境下交通标志识别的挑战，为自动驾驶系统提供了更准确的环境语义理解。

Abstract: The thermal camera excels at perceiving outdoor environments under low-light
conditions, making it ideal for applications such as nighttime autonomous
driving and unmanned navigation. However, thermal cameras encounter challenges
when capturing signage from objects made of similar materials, which can pose
safety risks for accurately understanding semantics in autonomous driving
systems. In contrast, the neuromorphic vision camera, also known as an event
camera, detects changes in light intensity asynchronously and has proven
effective in high-speed, low-light traffic environments. Recognizing the
complementary characteristics of these two modalities, this paper proposes
UTA-Sign, an unsupervised thermal-event video augmentation for traffic signage
in low-illumination environments, targeting elements such as license plates and
roadblock indicators. To address the signage blind spots of thermal imaging and
the non-uniform sampling of event cameras, we developed a dual-boosting
mechanism that fuses thermal frames and event signals for consistent signage
representation over time. The proposed method utilizes thermal frames to
provide accurate motion cues as temporal references for aligning the uneven
event signals. At the same time, event signals contribute subtle signage
content to the raw thermal frames, enhancing the overall understanding of the
environment. The proposed method is validated on datasets collected from
real-world scenarios, demonstrating superior quality in traffic signage
sketching and improved detection accuracy at the perceptual level.

Abstract: Deepfake technology, driven by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), poses
significant risks to privacy and societal security. Existing detection methods
are predominantly passive, focusing on post-event analysis without preventing
attacks. To address this, we propose an active defense method based on
low-frequency perceptual perturbations to disrupt face swapping manipulation,
reducing the performance and naturalness of generated content. Unlike prior
approaches that used low-frequency perturbations to impact classification
accuracy,our method directly targets the generative process of deepfake
techniques. We combine frequency and spatial domain features to strengthen
defenses. By introducing artifacts through low-frequency perturbations while
preserving high-frequency details, we ensure the output remains visually
plausible. Additionally, we design a complete architecture featuring an
encoder, a perturbation generator, and a decoder, leveraging discrete wavelet
transform (DWT) to extract low-frequency components and generate perturbations
that disrupt facial manipulation models. Experiments on CelebA-HQ and LFW
demonstrate significant reductions in face-swapping effectiveness, improved
defense success rates, and preservation of visual quality.

Abstract: Generating 3D human motions from text is a challenging yet valuable task. The
key aspects of this task are ensuring text-motion consistency and achieving
generation diversity. Although recent advancements have enabled the generation
of precise and high-quality human motions from text, achieving diversity in the
generated motions remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we aim to
overcome the above challenge by designing a simple yet effective text-to-motion
generation method, \textit{i.e.}, Diverse-T2M. Our method introduces
uncertainty into the generation process, enabling the generation of highly
diverse motions while preserving the semantic consistency of the text.
Specifically, we propose a novel perspective that utilizes noise signals as
carriers of diversity information in transformer-based methods, facilitating a
explicit modeling of uncertainty. Moreover, we construct a latent space where
text is projected into a continuous representation, instead of a rigid
one-to-one mapping, and integrate a latent space sampler to introduce
stochastic sampling into the generation process, thereby enhancing the
diversity and uncertainty of the outputs. Our results on text-to-motion
generation benchmark datasets~(HumanML3D and KIT-ML) demonstrate that our
method significantly enhances diversity while maintaining state-of-the-art
performance in text consistency.

Abstract: Intraoperative ultrasound images are inherently challenging to interpret in
liver surgery due to the limited field of view and complex anatomical
structures. Bridging the gap between preoperative and intraoperative data is
crucial for effective surgical guidance. 3D IntraVascular UltraSound (IVUS)
offers a potential solution by enabling the reconstruction of the entire organ,
which facilitates registration between preoperative computed tomography (CT)
scans and intraoperative IVUS images. In this work, we propose an
optimization-based calibration method using a 3D-printed phantom for accurate
3D Intravascular Ultrasound volume reconstruction. Our approach ensures precise
alignment of tracked IVUS data with preoperative CT images, improving
intraoperative navigation. We validated our method using in vivo swine liver
images, achieving a calibration error from 0.88 to 1.80 mm and a registration
error from 3.40 to 5.71 mm between the 3D IVUS data and the corresponding CT
scan. Our method provides a reliable and accurate means of calibration and
volume reconstruction. It can be used to register intraoperative ultrasound
images with preoperative CT images in the context of liver surgery, and enhance
intraoperative guidance.

Abstract: In semiconductor manufacturing, defect detection and localization are
critical to ensuring product quality and yield. While X-ray imaging is a
reliable non-destructive testing method, it is memory-intensive and
time-consuming for large-scale scanning, Magnetic Field Imaging (MFI) offers a
more efficient means to localize regions of interest (ROI) for targeted X-ray
scanning. However, the limited availability of MFI datasets due to proprietary
concerns presents a significant bottleneck for training machine learning (ML)
models using MFI. To address this challenge, we consider an ML-driven approach
leveraging diffusion models with two physical constraints. We propose Physics
Informed Generative Models for Magnetic Field Images (PI-GenMFI) to generate
synthetic MFI samples by integrating specific physical information. We generate
MFI images for the most common defect types: power shorts. These synthetic
images will serve as training data for ML algorithms designed to localize
defect areas efficiently. To evaluate generated MFIs, we compare our model to
SOTA generative models from both variational autoencoder (VAE) and diffusion
methods. We present a domain expert evaluation to assess the generated samples.
In addition, we present qualitative and quantitative evaluation using various
metrics used for image generation and signal processing, showing promising
results to optimize the defect localization process.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种更加高效的数据重构攻击方法，能够更好地利用语义信息来恢复敏感数据，显示了分开推理中的隐私风险需要更加关注。

Abstract: The growing complexity of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has led to the adoption
of Split Inference (SI), a collaborative paradigm that partitions computation
between edge devices and the cloud to reduce latency and protect user privacy.
However, recent advances in Data Reconstruction Attacks (DRAs) reveal that
intermediate features exchanged in SI can be exploited to recover sensitive
input data, posing significant privacy risks. Existing DRAs are typically
effective only on shallow models and fail to fully leverage semantic priors,
limiting their reconstruction quality and generalizability across datasets and
model architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN-based DRA framework
with Progressive Feature Optimization (PFO), which decomposes the generator
into hierarchical blocks and incrementally refines intermediate representations
to enhance the semantic fidelity of reconstructed images. To stabilize the
optimization and improve image realism, we introduce an L1-ball constraint
during reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms
prior attacks by a large margin, especially in high-resolution scenarios,
out-of-distribution settings, and against deeper and more complex DNNs.

Abstract: Emotional talking head synthesis aims to generate talking portrait videos
with vivid expressions. Existing methods still exhibit limitations in control
flexibility, motion naturalness, and expression quality. Moreover, currently
available datasets are primarily collected in lab settings, further
exacerbating these shortcomings. Consequently, these limitations substantially
hinder practical applications in real-world scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose EmoCAST, a diffusion-based framework with two key
modules for precise text-driven emotional synthesis. In appearance modeling,
emotional prompts are integrated through a text-guided decoupled emotive
module, enhancing the spatial knowledge to improve emotion comprehension. To
improve the relationship between audio and emotion, we introduce an emotive
audio attention module to capture the interplay between controlled emotion and
driving audio, generating emotion-aware features to guide more precise facial
motion synthesis. Additionally, we construct an emotional talking head dataset
with comprehensive emotive text descriptions to optimize the framework's
performance. Based on the proposed dataset, we propose an emotion-aware
sampling training strategy and a progressive functional training strategy that
further improve the model's ability to capture nuanced expressive features and
achieve accurate lip-synchronization. Overall, EmoCAST achieves
state-of-the-art performance in generating realistic, emotionally expressive,
and audio-synchronized talking-head videos. Project Page:

Motivation: 乳腺癌是女性癌症死亡的主要原因，早期检测对改善预后至关重要。MRI对高风险或致密乳腺组织女性特别有效，但需要AI辅助提高诊断效率

Method: 开发SwinUNETR深度学习框架，包含乳腺区域掩码、广泛数据增强和集成学习技术，使用多中心511个研究数据

Result: 在ODELIA多中心挑战中获得第二名，证明了该方法在临床乳腺MRI解读中的潜力

Conclusion: 该方法展示了良好的鲁棒性和泛化能力，代码已公开分享，有望支持临床乳腺癌诊断

Abstract: Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality in
women, and early detection is essential for improving outcomes. Magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) is a highly sensitive tool for breast cancer detection,
particularly in women at high risk or with dense breast tissue, where
mammography is less effective. The ODELIA consortium organized a multi-center
challenge to foster AI-based solutions for breast cancer diagnosis and
classification. The dataset included 511 studies from six European centers,
acquired on scanners from multiple vendors at both 1.5 T and 3 T. Each study
was labeled for the left and right breast as no lesion, benign lesion, or
malignant lesion. We developed a SwinUNETR-based deep learning framework that
incorporates breast region masking, extensive data augmentation, and ensemble
learning to improve robustness and generalizability. Our method achieved second
place on the challenge leaderboard, highlighting its potential to support
clinical breast MRI interpretation. We publicly share our codebase at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AvatarBack是一个新颖的即插即用框架，通过显式建模缺失的后脑区域来重建完整一致的3D高斯头像，解决了现有方法主要依赖正面视图导致后脑重建质量差的问题。

Result: 在NeRSemble和K-hairstyle数据集上的实验表明，AvatarBack显著提升了后脑重建质量，同时保持了正面保真度，重建的头像在不同动作下保持一致的视觉真实感且完全可动画化。

Conclusion: AvatarBack通过生成身份一致的后视伪图像和自适应空间对齐，有效解决了3D高斯头像重建中后脑区域质量差的问题，为完整一致的头像重建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Gaussian Splatting have significantly boosted the
reconstruction of head avatars, enabling high-quality facial modeling by
representing an 3D avatar as a collection of 3D Gaussians. However, existing
methods predominantly rely on frontal-view images, leaving the back-head poorly
constructed. This leads to geometric inconsistencies, structural blurring, and
reduced realism in the rear regions, ultimately limiting the fidelity of
reconstructed avatars. To address this challenge, we propose AvatarBack, a
novel plug-and-play framework specifically designed to reconstruct complete and
consistent 3D Gaussian avatars by explicitly modeling the missing back-head
regions. AvatarBack integrates two core technical innovations,i.e., the
Subject-specific Generator (SSG) and the Adaptive Spatial Alignment Strategy
(ASA). The former leverages a generative prior to synthesize
identity-consistent, plausible back-view pseudo-images from sparse frontal
inputs, providing robust multi-view supervision. To achieve precise geometric
alignment between these synthetic views and the 3D Gaussian representation, the
later employs learnable transformation matrices optimized during training,
effectively resolving inherent pose and coordinate discrepancies. Extensive
experiments on NeRSemble and K-hairstyle datasets, evaluated using geometric,
photometric, and GPT-4o-based perceptual metrics, demonstrate that AvatarBack
significantly enhances back-head reconstruction quality while preserving
frontal fidelity. Moreover, the reconstructed avatars maintain consistent
visual realism under diverse motions and remain fully animatable.

Motivation: 历史绘画中的人物识别对艺术史研究很重要，但传统人脸识别模型在处理绘画时表现不佳，主要由于领域偏移、艺术风格变化等因素。需要探索新的方法来克服这些挑战。

Method: 通过微调基础模型，并将其嵌入特征与传统人脸识别网络的嵌入特征进行整合，构建了一个改进的艺术作品人脸识别系统。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法相比当前最先进的方法取得了显著改进，基础模型能够有效弥补传统方法在艺术作品识别中的不足。

Conclusion: 基础模型在艺术作品人脸识别方面具有巨大潜力，能够有效解决传统方法因领域偏移和艺术风格变化而面临的挑战，为艺术史研究提供了有力的技术支撑。

Abstract: Identifying sitters in historical paintings is a key task for art historians,
offering insight into their lives and how they chose to be seen. However, the
process is often subjective and limited by the lack of data and stylistic
variations. Automated facial recognition is capable of handling challenging
conditions and can assist, but while traditional facial recognition models
perform well on photographs, they struggle with paintings due to domain shift
and high intra-class variation. Artistic factors such as style, skill, intent,
and influence from other works further complicate recognition. In this work, we
investigate the potential of foundation models to improve facial recognition in
artworks. By fine-tuning foundation models and integrating their embeddings
with those from conventional facial recognition networks, we demonstrate
notable improvements over current state-of-the-art methods. Our results show
that foundation models can bridge the gap where traditional methods are
ineffective. Paper page at https://www.idiap.ch/paper/artface/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决涂鸦艺术中极端风格转换导致面部身份识别性丢失的问题，保持个人和文化真实性，推动身份尊重的AI辅助艺术创作。

Method: 使用LoRA微调的预训练扩散变换器进行涂鸦风格迁移，通过面部一致性自注意力机制增强身份嵌入，采用CLIP引导的提示扩展实现无关键点的姿态定制。

Result: 在面部特征一致性方面表现优异，获得最先进的美学和人类偏好评分，在Cruilla Festival现场部署展示了实际创作影响力。

Conclusion: CraftGraffiti为创意AI应用提供了将风格自由与可识别性相结合的原则性方法，推动了身份尊重的AI辅助艺术发展。

Abstract: Preserving facial identity under extreme stylistic transformation remains a
major challenge in generative art. In graffiti, a high-contrast, abstract
medium, subtle distortions to the eyes, nose, or mouth can erase the subject's
recognizability, undermining both personal and cultural authenticity. We
present CraftGraffiti, an end-to-end text-guided graffiti generation framework
designed with facial feature preservation as a primary objective. Given an
input image and a style and pose descriptive prompt, CraftGraffiti first
applies graffiti style transfer via LoRA-fine-tuned pretrained diffusion
transformer, then enforces identity fidelity through a face-consistent
self-attention mechanism that augments attention layers with explicit identity
embeddings. Pose customization is achieved without keypoints, using CLIP-guided
prompt extension to enable dynamic re-posing while retaining facial coherence.
We formally justify and empirically validate the "style-first, identity-after"
paradigm, showing it reduces attribute drift compared to the reverse order.
Quantitative results demonstrate competitive facial feature consistency and
state-of-the-art aesthetic and human preference scores, while qualitative
analyses and a live deployment at the Cruilla Festival highlight the system's
real-world creative impact. CraftGraffiti advances the goal of
identity-respectful AI-assisted artistry, offering a principled approach for
blending stylistic freedom with recognizability in creative AI applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型对齐方法依赖外部数据集、人工标注或复杂后处理，限制了可扩展性并增加成本，需要更有效的自主对齐解决方案

Method: 生成去偏自判断分数作为自评估指标，不依赖外部资源，通过改进解码策略和偏好调优过程来实现模型自主对齐

Result: 实验结果表明该方法显著优于传统方法，有效减少幻觉、增强安全性并提升整体能力

Conclusion: 该方法为视觉语言模型对齐提供了更有效的解决方案，通过内部自评估实现自主改进，具有良好的应用前景

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large
Visual-Language Models (LVLMs) have opened up new opportunities for integrating
visual and linguistic modalities. However, effectively aligning these
modalities remains challenging, often leading to hallucinations--where
generated outputs are not grounded in the visual input--and raising safety
concerns across various domains. Existing alignment methods, such as
instruction tuning and preference tuning, often rely on external datasets,
human annotations, or complex post-processing, which limit scalability and
increase costs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that
generates the debiased self-judgment score, a self-evaluation metric created
internally by the model without relying on external resources. This enables the
model to autonomously improve alignment. Our method enhances both decoding
strategies and preference tuning processes, resulting in reduced
hallucinations, enhanced safety, and improved overall capability. Empirical
results show that our approach significantly outperforms traditional methods,
offering a more effective solution for aligning LVLMs.

Motivation: 现有研究大多忽视AI生成图像背后的意图，需要填补这一空白来更好地检测合成内容和上下文外内容。

Method: 构建S-HArM数据集，探索三种提示策略（图像引导、描述引导、多模态引导）使用Stable Diffusion生成大规模合成训练数据，比较多种模型架构包括模态融合、对比学习、重建网络、注意力机制和大规模视觉语言模型。

Result: 基于图像和多模态引导数据训练的模型对真实内容泛化能力更强，因为保留了视觉上下文。但整体性能仍然有限。

Conclusion: 推断意图具有复杂性，需要专门架构来提升性能，视觉上下文的保留对模型泛化至关重要。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal AI have enabled progress in detecting synthetic
and out-of-context content. However, existing efforts largely overlook the
intent behind AI-generated images. To fill this gap, we introduce S-HArM, a
multimodal dataset for intent-aware classification, comprising 9,576 "in the
wild" image-text pairs from Twitter/X and Reddit, labeled as Humor/Satire, Art,
or Misinformation. Additionally, we explore three prompting strategies
(image-guided, description-guided, and multimodally-guided) to construct a
large-scale synthetic training dataset with Stable Diffusion. We conduct an
extensive comparative study including modality fusion, contrastive learning,
reconstruction networks, attention mechanisms, and large vision-language
models. Our results show that models trained on image- and multimodally-guided
data generalize better to "in the wild" content, due to preserved visual
context. However, overall performance remains limited, highlighting the
complexity of inferring intent and the need for specialized architectures.

Abstract: Foundation image-text models such as CLIP with zero-shot capabilities enable
a wide array of applications. MobileCLIP is a recent family of image-text
models at 3-15ms latency and 50-150M parameters with state-of-the-art zero-shot
accuracy. The main ingredients in MobileCLIP were its low-latency and light
architectures and a novel multi-modal reinforced training that made knowledge
distillation from multiple caption-generators and CLIP teachers efficient,
scalable, and reproducible. In this paper, we improve the multi-modal
reinforced training of MobileCLIP through: 1) better CLIP teacher ensembles
trained on the DFN dataset, 2) improved captioner teachers trained on the DFN
dataset and fine-tuned on a diverse selection of high-quality image-caption
datasets. We discover new insights through ablations such as the importance of
temperature tuning in contrastive knowledge distillation, the effectiveness of
caption-generator fine-tuning for caption diversity, and the additive
improvement from combining synthetic captions generated by multiple models. We
train a new family of models called MobileCLIP2 and achieve state-of-the-art
ImageNet-1k zero-shot accuracies at low latencies. In particular, we observe
2.2% improvement in ImageNet-1k accuracy for MobileCLIP2-B compared with
MobileCLIP-B architecture. Notably, MobileCLIP2-S4 matches the zero-shot
accuracy of SigLIP-SO400M/14 on ImageNet-1k while being 2$\times$ smaller and
improves on DFN ViT-L/14 at 2.5$\times$ lower latency. We release our
pretrained models (https://github.com/apple/ml-mobileclip) and the data
generation code (https://github.com/apple/ml-mobileclip-dr). The data
generation code makes it easy to create new reinforced datasets with arbitrary
teachers using distributed scalable processing.

Motivation: 神经视频压缩虽然性能显著，但学习型编解码器存在固有局限性，精确的速率控制仍然是一个挑战，需要解决可变比特率场景下的控制问题

Method: 1) 提出动态路由自动编码器(DRA)，具有可变编码路径，每条路径占用部分计算复杂度并对应不同的RD权衡；2) 使用速率控制代理实时估计每条路径的比特率并调整编码路径；3) 采用联合路径优化策略实现多种路径的协同训练

Result: 在HEVC和UVG数据集上的实验显示，该方法相比最先进方法平均BD-Rate降低14.8%，BD-PSNR增益0.47dB，平均比特率误差仅为1.66%，实现了各种比特率和比特率约束应用的RDCO优化

Conclusion: 所提出的动态视频压缩框架成功解决了神经视频压缩中的精确速率控制问题，在可变比特率场景下实现了优异的性能表现，为实际应用提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Neural Video Compression (NVC) has achieved remarkable performance in recent
years. However, precise rate control remains a challenge due to the inherent
limitations of learning-based codecs. To solve this issue, we propose a dynamic
video compression framework designed for variable bitrate scenarios. First, to
achieve variable bitrate implementation, we propose the Dynamic-Route
Autoencoder with variable coding routes, each occupying partial computational
complexity of the whole network and navigating to a distinct RD trade-off.
Second, to approach the target bitrate, the Rate Control Agent estimates the
bitrate of each route and adjusts the coding route of DRA at run time. To
encompass a broad spectrum of variable bitrates while preserving overall RD
performance, we employ the Joint-Routes Optimization strategy, achieving
collaborative training of various routes. Extensive experiments on the HEVC and
UVG datasets show that the proposed method achieves an average BD-Rate
reduction of 14.8% and BD-PSNR gain of 0.47dB over state-of-the-art methods
while maintaining an average bitrate error of 1.66%, achieving
Rate-Distortion-Complexity Optimization (RDCO) for various bitrate and
bitrate-constrained applications. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有心脏运动估计方法依赖基于强度的图像配准相似性损失，往往忽略心脏解剖区域，导致运动估计不准确。

Method: 提出循环变分自编码器框架，建模心脏周期的时空依赖性，使用两个后验模型进行双心室分割和运动估计，通过递归配准分割图来关注解剖区域。

Conclusion: 该方法通过形状引导的配准和贝叶斯建模，能够更准确地估计心脏运动并提供不确定性评估，在心脏功能评估中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Accurate cardiac motion estimation from cine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)
images is vital for assessing cardiac function and detecting its abnormalities.
Existing methods often struggle to capture heart motion accurately because they
rely on intensity-based image registration similarity losses that may overlook
cardiac anatomical regions. To address this, we propose CardioMorphNet, a
recurrent Bayesian deep learning framework for 3D cardiac shape-guided
deformable registration using short-axis (SAX) CMR images. It employs a
recurrent variational autoencoder to model spatio-temporal dependencies over
the cardiac cycle and two posterior models for bi-ventricular segmentation and
motion estimation. The derived loss function from the Bayesian formulation
guides the framework to focus on anatomical regions by recursively registering
segmentation maps without using intensity-based image registration similarity
loss, while leveraging sequential SAX volumes and spatio-temporal features. The
Bayesian modelling also enables computation of uncertainty maps for the
estimated motion fields. Validated on the UK Biobank dataset by comparing
warped mask shapes with ground truth masks, CardioMorphNet demonstrates
superior performance in cardiac motion estimation, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods. Uncertainty assessment shows that it also yields
lower uncertainty values for estimated motion fields in the cardiac region
compared with other probabilistic-based cardiac registration methods,
indicating higher confidence in its predictions.

Abstract: Atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) are important histopathological markers yet
remain challenging to identify consistently, particularly under domain shift
stemming from scanner, stain, and acquisition differences. We present a simple
training-time recipe for domain-robust AMF classification in MIDOG 2025 Task 2.
The approach (i) increases feature diversity via style perturbations inserted
at early and mid backbone stages, (ii) aligns attention-refined features across
sites using weak domain labels (Scanner, Origin, Species, Tumor) through an
auxiliary alignment loss, and (iii) stabilizes predictions by distilling from
an exponential moving average (EMA) teacher with temperature-scaled KL
divergence. On the organizer-run preliminary leaderboard for atypical mitosis
classification, our submission attains balanced accuracy of 0.8762, sensitivity
of 0.8873, specificity of 0.8651, and ROC AUC of 0.9499. The method incurs
negligible inference-time overhead, relies only on coarse domain metadata, and
delivers strong, balanced performance, positioning it as a competitive
submission for the MIDOG 2025 challenge.

Motivation: 当前基于点式奖励模型的T2I生成方法容易受到奖励黑客攻击，微小分数差异经过归一化后被放大，导致模型过度优化琐碎增益而破坏生成稳定性

Method: Pref-GRPO：基于成对偏好奖励的GRPO方法，在每组图像中使用偏好RM进行成对比较，以胜率作为奖励信号；UniGenBench：包含600个提示的统一基准，通过10个主要和27个子标准评估语义一致性

Conclusion: Pref-GRPO通过偏好拟合优化目标解决了奖励最大化带来的不稳定问题，配合综合评估基准UniGenBench，为T2I生成提供了更可靠的训练和评估框架

Abstract: Recent advancements highlight the importance of GRPO-based reinforcement
learning methods and benchmarking in enhancing text-to-image (T2I) generation.
However, current methods using pointwise reward models (RM) for scoring
generated images are susceptible to reward hacking. We reveal that this happens
when minimal score differences between images are amplified after
normalization, creating illusory advantages that drive the model to
over-optimize for trivial gains, ultimately destabilizing the image generation
process. To address this, we propose Pref-GRPO, a pairwise preference
reward-based GRPO method that shifts the optimization objective from score
maximization to preference fitting, ensuring more stable training. In
Pref-GRPO, images are pairwise compared within each group using preference RM,
and the win rate is used as the reward signal. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PREF-GRPO differentiates subtle image quality differences,
providing more stable advantages and mitigating reward hacking. Additionally,
existing T2I benchmarks are limited by coarse evaluation criteria, hindering
comprehensive model assessment. To solve this, we introduce UniGenBench, a
unified T2I benchmark comprising 600 prompts across 5 main themes and 20
subthemes. It evaluates semantic consistency through 10 primary and 27
sub-criteria, leveraging MLLM for benchmark construction and evaluation. Our
benchmarks uncover the strengths and weaknesses of both open and closed-source
T2I models and validate the effectiveness of Pref-GRPO.

Abstract: Generalizable Gaussian Splatting aims to synthesize novel views for unseen

utilize feed-forward networks to predict per-pixel Gaussian parameters,
enabling high-quality synthesis from sparse input views. However, existing

and enabling photorealistic synthesis without requiring additional supervision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有零样本3D视觉定位方法因依赖单视角定位而导致的空间推理受限、上下文遗漏和细节退化问题，消除场景特定训练需求，提升真实世界应用潜力。

Method: 首先通过3D语义分割网络生成3D实例提案并进行语义过滤；然后使用提案引导的多视角投影策略将候选提案投影到真实场景图像序列；最后通过动态调度机制迭代处理序列查询提示，利用VLM的跨模态推理能力识别文本指定对象。

Conclusion: SeqVLM框架显著提升了3D视觉定位的泛化能力和真实世界适用性，为零样本3DVG任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) aims to localize objects in 3D scenes using
natural language descriptions. Although supervised methods achieve higher
accuracy in constrained settings, zero-shot 3DVG holds greater promise for
real-world applications since eliminating scene-specific training requirements.
However, existing zero-shot methods face challenges of spatial-limited
reasoning due to reliance on single-view localization, and contextual omissions
or detail degradation. To address these issues, we propose SeqVLM, a novel
zero-shot 3DVG framework that leverages multi-view real-world scene images with
spatial information for target object reasoning. Specifically, SeqVLM first
generates 3D instance proposals via a 3D semantic segmentation network and
refines them through semantic filtering, retaining only semantic-relevant
candidates. A proposal-guided multi-view projection strategy then projects
these candidate proposals onto real scene image sequences, preserving spatial
relationships and contextual details in the conversion process of 3D point
cloud to images. Furthermore, to mitigate VLM computational overload, we
implement a dynamic scheduling mechanism that iteratively processes
sequances-query prompts, leveraging VLM's cross-modal reasoning capabilities to
identify textually specified objects. Experiments on the ScanRefer and Nr3D
benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving Acc@0.25 scores
of 55.6% and 53.2%, surpassing previous zero-shot methods by 4.0% and 5.2%,
respectively, which advance 3DVG toward greater generalization and real-world
applicability. The code is available at https://github.com/JiawLin/SeqVLM.

Motivation: CLIP模型在军事应用中具有零样本分类优势，但其在遮挡和噪声等挑战性环境中的鲁棒性尚未充分研究，需要评估其在真实军事部署场景中的表现。

Method: 使用包含18类军事车辆的自定义数据集，通过不同遮挡百分比测试CLIP变体的性能，采用归一化曲线下面积(NAUC)作为评估指标，比较Transformer和CNN架构，分析线性探测和骨干网络微调的效果。

Result: 1) Transformer-based CLIP consistently outperforms CNNs; 2) Fine-grained, dispersed occlusions degrade performance more than larger contiguous occlusions; 3) Linear-probed models' performance sharply drops at around 35% occlusion; 4) Finetuning the backbone delays performance drop to more than 60% occlusion.

Conclusion: 研究强调了训练过程中遮挡特定增强的重要性，需要进一步探索补丁级敏感性和架构韧性，以确保CLIP在真实世界军事部署中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP enable zero-shot classification by
aligning images and text in a shared embedding space, offering advantages for
defense applications with scarce labeled data. However, CLIP's robustness in
challenging military environments, with partial occlusion and degraded
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), remains underexplored. We investigate CLIP
variants' robustness to occlusion using a custom dataset of 18 military vehicle
classes and evaluate using Normalized Area Under the Curve (NAUC) across
occlusion percentages. Four key insights emerge: (1) Transformer-based CLIP
models consistently outperform CNNs, (2) fine-grained, dispersed occlusions
degrade performance more than larger contiguous occlusions, (3) despite
improved accuracy, performance of linear-probed models sharply drops at around
35% occlusion, (4) by finetuning the model's backbone, this performance drop
occurs at more than 60% occlusion. These results underscore the importance of
occlusion-specific augmentations during training and the need for further
exploration into patch-level sensitivity and architectural resilience for
real-world deployment of CLIP.

Abstract: Focusing on the development of an end-to-end autonomous vehicle model with
pixel-to-pixel context awareness, this research proposes the SKGE-Swin
architecture. This architecture utilizes the Swin Transformer with a skip-stage
mechanism to broaden feature representation globally and at various network
levels. This approach enables the model to extract information from distant
pixels by leveraging the Swin Transformer's Shifted Window-based Multi-head
Self-Attention (SW-MSA) mechanism and to retain critical information from the
initial to the final stages of feature extraction, thereby enhancing its
capability to comprehend complex patterns in the vehicle's surroundings. The
model is evaluated on the CARLA platform using adversarial scenarios to
simulate real-world conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the
SKGE-Swin architecture achieves a superior Driving Score compared to previous
methods. Furthermore, an ablation study will be conducted to evaluate the
contribution of each architectural component, including the influence of skip
connections and the use of the Swin Transformer, in improving model
performance.

Abstract: The automatic understanding of video content is advancing rapidly. Empowered
by deeper neural networks and large datasets, machines are increasingly capable
of understanding what is concretely visible in video frames, whether it be
objects, actions, events, or scenes. In comparison, humans retain a unique
ability to also look beyond concrete entities and recognize abstract concepts
like justice, freedom, and togetherness. Abstract concept recognition forms a
crucial open challenge in video understanding, where reasoning on multiple
semantic levels based on contextual information is key. In this paper, we argue
that the recent advances in foundation models make for an ideal setting to
address abstract concept understanding in videos. Automated understanding of
high-level abstract concepts is imperative as it enables models to be more
aligned with human reasoning and values. In this survey, we study different
tasks and datasets used to understand abstract concepts in video content. We
observe that, periodically and over a long period, researchers have attempted
to solve these tasks, making the best use of the tools available at their
disposal. We advocate that drawing on decades of community experience will help
us shed light on this important open grand challenge and avoid ``re-inventing
the wheel'' as we start revisiting it in the era of multi-modal foundation
models.

Abstract: Recent advancements in skin lesion classification models have significantly
improved accuracy, with some models even surpassing dermatologists' diagnostic
performance. However, in medical practice, distrust in AI models remains a
challenge. Beyond high accuracy, trustworthy, explainable diagnoses are
essential. Existing explainability methods have reliability issues, with
LIME-based methods suffering from inconsistency, while CAM-based methods
failing to consider all classes. To address these limitations, we propose
Global Class Activation Probabilistic Map Evaluation, a method that analyses
all classes' activation probability maps probabilistically and at a pixel
level. By visualizing the diagnostic process in a unified manner, it helps
reduce the risk of misdiagnosis. Furthermore, the application of SafeML
enhances the detection of false diagnoses and issues warnings to doctors and
patients as needed, improving diagnostic reliability and ultimately patient
safety. We evaluated our method using the ISIC datasets with MobileNetV2 and
Vision Transformers.

TL;DR: 本文探讨生成式扩散分类器在组合泛化能力方面是否优于判别式模型（如CLIP和ViLT），特别是在属性绑定和关系推理任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言语义的核心特征是通过已知部分的组合形成新含义，但现有的视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在处理组合语义时表现不佳，容易出现"词袋"式的错误识别。

Method: 评估三种模型（扩散分类器、CLIP和ViLT）在零样本学习（ZSL）和广义零样本学习（GZSL）设置下绑定对象属性与关系的能力，并分析CLIP嵌入表示的特征。

Result: 扩散分类器和ViLT在概念绑定任务上表现良好，但所有模型在关系GZSL任务上都面临显著困难。CLIP嵌入分析表明，关系概念（如左右）的表示过于相似可能是困难的原因。

Conclusion: 虽然扩散分类器在某些组合任务上表现更好，但视觉语言模型在关系推理方面仍面临普遍挑战，需要进一步改进关系概念的表示学习。

Abstract: A fundamental aspect of the semantics of natural language is that novel
meanings can be formed from the composition of previously known parts.
Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in recent years,
however, there is evidence that they are unable to perform this kind of
composition. For example, given an image of a red cube and a blue cylinder, a
VLM such as CLIP is likely to incorrectly label the image as a red cylinder or
a blue cube, indicating it represents the image as a `bag-of-words' and fails
to capture compositional semantics. Diffusion models have recently gained
significant attention for their impressive generative abilities, and zero-shot
classifiers based on diffusion models have been shown to perform competitively
with CLIP in certain compositional tasks. In this work we explore whether the
generative Diffusion Classifier has improved compositional generalisation
abilities compared to discriminative models. We assess three models --
Diffusion Classifier, CLIP, and ViLT -- on their ability to bind objects with
attributes and relations in both zero-shot learning (ZSL) and generalised
zero-shot learning (GZSL) settings. Our results show that the Diffusion
Classifier and ViLT perform well at concept binding tasks, but that all models
struggle significantly with the relational GZSL task, underscoring the broader
challenges VLMs face with relational reasoning. Analysis of CLIP embeddings
suggests that the difficulty may stem from overly similar representations of
relational concepts such as left and right. Code and dataset are available at:

Result: 在室内外数据集上相比最先进方法表现出优越性和鲁棒性能

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理点云配准中的噪声和旋转问题，提高配准精度和鲁棒性

Abstract: Point cloud registration is crucial for ensuring 3D alignment consistency of
multiple local point clouds in 3D reconstruction for remote sensing or digital
heritage. While various point cloud-based registration methods exist, both
non-learning and learning-based, they ignore point orientations and point
uncertainties, making the model susceptible to noisy input and aggressive
rotations of the input point cloud like orthogonal transformation; thus, it
necessitates extensive training point clouds with transformation augmentations.
To address these issues, we propose a novel surfel-based pose learning
regression approach. Our method can initialize surfels from Lidar point cloud
using virtual perspective camera parameters, and learns explicit
$\mathbf{SE(3)}$ equivariant features, including both position and rotation
through $\mathbf{SE(3)}$ equivariant convolutional kernels to predict relative
transformation between source and target scans. The model comprises an
equivariant convolutional encoder, a cross-attention mechanism for similarity
computation, a fully-connected decoder, and a non-linear Huber loss.
Experimental results on indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate our model
superiority and robust performance on real point-cloud scans compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Accurate dental caries detection from panoramic X-rays plays a pivotal role
in preventing lesion progression. However, current detection methods often
yield suboptimal accuracy due to subtle contrast variations and diverse lesion
morphology of dental caries. In this work, inspired by the clinical workflow
where dentists systematically combine whole-image screening with detailed
tooth-level inspection, we present DVCTNet, a novel Dual-View Co-Training
network for accurate dental caries detection. Our DVCTNet starts with employing
automated tooth detection to establish two complementary views: a global view
from panoramic X-ray images and a local view from cropped tooth images. We then
pretrain two vision foundation models separately on the two views. The
global-view foundation model serves as the detection backbone, generating
region proposals and global features, while the local-view model extracts
detailed features from corresponding cropped tooth patches matched by the
region proposals. To effectively integrate information from both views, we
introduce a Gated Cross-View Attention (GCV-Atten) module that dynamically
fuses dual-view features, enhancing the detection pipeline by integrating the
fused features back into the detection model for final caries detection. To
rigorously evaluate our DVCTNet, we test it on a public dataset and further
validate its performance on a newly curated, high-precision dental caries
detection dataset, annotated using both intra-oral images and panoramic X-rays
for double verification. Experimental results demonstrate DVCTNet's superior
performance against existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on both datasets,
indicating the clinical applicability of our method. Our code and labeled
dataset are available at https://github.com/ShanghaiTech-IMPACT/DVCTNet.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FusionCounting是一个新颖的多任务学习框架，将人群计数集成到可见光和红外图像融合过程中，通过动态损失权重和对抗训练提升融合质量和计数性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VIF方法主要关注图像质量优化，语义分割需要大量标注，目标检测在拥挤场景中面临边界框重叠和遮挡问题。RGB-T人群计数虽受关注但尚未与VIF整合。

Method: 提出多任务学习框架，利用人群计数提供密度信息指导图像融合；采用动态损失函数权重策略加速收敛；引入对抗训练增强鲁棒性。

Result: 在公开数据集上的实验表明，FusionCounting不仅提升了图像融合质量，还实现了优越的人群计数性能。

Conclusion: 将人群计数集成到VIF框架中是有效的，通过多任务设计和对抗训练可以同时提升融合质量和下游任务性能，特别适合密集场景应用。

Abstract: Most visible and infrared image fusion (VIF) methods focus primarily on
optimizing fused image quality. Recent studies have begun incorporating
downstream tasks, such as semantic segmentation and object detection, to
provide semantic guidance for VIF. However, semantic segmentation requires
extensive annotations, while object detection, despite reducing annotation
efforts compared with segmentation, faces challenges in highly crowded scenes
due to overlapping bounding boxes and occlusion. Moreover, although RGB-T crowd
counting has gained increasing attention in recent years, no studies have
integrated VIF and crowd counting into a unified framework. To address these
challenges, we propose FusionCounting, a novel multi-task learning framework
that integrates crowd counting into the VIF process. Crowd counting provides a
direct quantitative measure of population density with minimal annotation,
making it particularly suitable for dense scenes. Our framework leverages both
input images and population density information in a mutually beneficial
multi-task design. To accelerate convergence and balance tasks contributions,
we introduce a dynamic loss function weighting strategy. Furthermore, we
incorporate adversarial training to enhance the robustness of both VIF and
crowd counting, improving the model's stability and resilience to adversarial
attacks. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that
FusionCounting not only enhances image fusion quality but also achieves
superior crowd counting performance.

Motivation: 传统CNN和Transformer模型在小规模医学数据集上容易过拟合，需要利用前训练VLM的演化能力来提高关键点检测的演化性能。

Method: 设计特定提示创建指令调整数据集，使用LoRA技术对VLM进行精细调整，将视觉特征与语义关键点描述对齐。

Result: 仅经过两个训练迭代，调整后的VLM就超过了基线模型，在低资源场景下显示出良好效果。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提高了2D关键点检测性能，为未来3D手术手和工具姿态估计研究链接了路径。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel pipeline for 2D keypoint estima- tion of surgical
tools by leveraging Vision Language Models (VLMs) fine- tuned using a low rank
adjusting (LoRA) technique. Unlike traditional Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) or Transformer-based approaches, which often suffer from overfitting in
small-scale medical datasets, our method harnesses the generalization
capabilities of pre-trained VLMs. We carefully design prompts to create an
instruction-tuning dataset and use them to align visual features with semantic
keypoint descriptions. Experimental results show that with only two epochs of
fine tuning, the adapted VLM outperforms the baseline models, demonstrating the
ef- fectiveness of LoRA in low-resource scenarios. This approach not only
improves keypoint detection performance, but also paves the way for future work
in 3D surgical hands and tools pose estimation.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了PointDGRWKV框架，首次将RWKV架构应用于点云分类领域的域逆向通用问题，通过适配性几何token移位和跨域特征对齐解决了RWKV在点云数据上的空间扭曲和波动效应问题，在保持线性复杂度的同时实现了独创性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的点云分类域逆向通用方法基于卷积网络、Transformer或Mamba架构，存在感知野局限、计算成本高或长距依赖建模不足等问题。RWKV架构具有线性复杂度、全局感知野和长距依赖建模优势，但直接应用于点云数据时会遇到空间扭曲和波动效应等挑战。

Result: 在多个标准数据集上进行了大量实验，结果表明PointDGRWKV在点云分类域逆向通用任务上达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: 该研究成功将RWKV架构扩展到点云数据领域，通过专门设计的模块解决了原有架构在非结构化数据上的限制，为点云分类的域逆向通用提供了一种高效且简洁的解决方案。

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) has been recently explored to enhance the
generalizability of Point Cloud Classification (PCC) models toward unseen
domains. Prior works are based on convolutional networks, Transformer or Mamba
architectures, either suffering from limited receptive fields or high
computational cost, or insufficient long-range dependency modeling. RWKV, as an
emerging architecture, possesses superior linear complexity, global receptive
fields, and long-range dependency. In this paper, we present the first work
that studies the generalizability of RWKV models in DG PCC. We find that
directly applying RWKV to DG PCC encounters two significant challenges: RWKV's
fixed direction token shift methods, like Q-Shift, introduce spatial
distortions when applied to unstructured point clouds, weakening local
geometric modeling and reducing robustness. In addition, the Bi-WKV attention
in RWKV amplifies slight cross-domain differences in key distributions through
exponential weighting, leading to attention shifts and degraded generalization.
To this end, we propose PointDGRWKV, the first RWKV-based framework tailored
for DG PCC. It introduces two key modules to enhance spatial modeling and
cross-domain robustness, while maintaining RWKV's linear efficiency. In
particular, we present Adaptive Geometric Token Shift to model local
neighborhood structures to improve geometric context awareness. In addition,
Cross-Domain key feature Distribution Alignment is designed to mitigate
attention drift by aligning key feature distributions across domains. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that PointDGRWKV achieves
state-of-the-art performance on DG PCC.

Abstract: Deep learning based automated pathological diagnosis has markedly improved
diagnostic efficiency and reduced variability between observers, yet its
clinical adoption remains limited by opaque model decisions and a lack of
traceable rationale. To address this, recent multimodal visual reasoning
architectures provide a unified framework that generates segmentation masks at
the pixel level alongside semantically aligned textual explanations. By
localizing lesion regions and producing expert style diagnostic narratives,
these models deliver the transparent and interpretable insights necessary for
dependable AI assisted pathology. Building on these advancements, we propose
PathMR, a cell-level Multimodal visual Reasoning framework for Pathological
image analysis. Given a pathological image and a textual query, PathMR
generates expert-level diagnostic explanations while simultaneously predicting
cell distribution patterns. To benchmark its performance, we evaluated our
approach on the publicly available PathGen dataset as well as on our newly
developed GADVR dataset. Extensive experiments on these two datasets
demonstrate that PathMR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art visual
reasoning methods in text generation quality, segmentation accuracy, and
cross-modal alignment. These results highlight the potential of PathMR for
improving interpretability in AI-driven pathological diagnosis. The code will

Abstract: Pacreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most lethal forms
of cancer, with a five-year survival rate below 10% primarily due to late
detection. This research develops and validates a deep learning framework for
early PDAC detection through analysis of dual-modality imaging:
autofluorescence and second harmonic generation (SHG). We analyzed 40 unique
patient samples to create a specialized neural network capable of
distinguishing between normal, fibrotic, and cancerous tissue. Our methodology
evaluated six distinct deep learning architectures, comparing traditional
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with modern Vision Transformers (ViTs).
Through systematic experimentation, we identified and overcome significant
challenges in medical image analysis, including limited dataset size and class
imbalance. The final optimized framework, based on a modified ResNet
architecture with frozen pre-trained layers and class-weighted training,
achieved over 90% accuracy in cancer detection. This represents a significant
improvement over current manual analysis methods an demonstrates potential for
clinical deployment. This work establishes a robust pipeline for automated PDAC
detection that can augment pathologists' capabilities while providing a
foundation for future expansion to other cancer types. The developed
methodology also offers valuable insights for applying deep learning to
limited-size medical imaging datasets, a common challenge in clinical
applications.

Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning -- the practice of asking ``what if'' by varying
inputs and observing changes in model behavior -- has become central to
interpretable and fair AI. This thesis develops frameworks that use
counterfactuals to explain, audit, and mitigate bias in vision classifiers and
generative models. By systematically altering semantically meaningful
attributes while holding others fixed, these methods uncover spurious
correlations, probe causal dependencies, and help build more robust systems.
  The first part addresses vision classifiers. CAVLI integrates attribution
(LIME) with concept-level analysis (TCAV) to quantify how strongly decisions
rely on human-interpretable concepts. With localized heatmaps and a Concept
Dependency Score, CAVLI shows when models depend on irrelevant cues like
backgrounds. Extending this, ASAC introduces adversarial counterfactuals that
perturb protected attributes while preserving semantics. Through curriculum
learning, ASAC fine-tunes biased models for improved fairness and accuracy
while avoiding stereotype-laden artifacts.
  The second part targets generative Text-to-Image (TTI) models. TIBET provides
a scalable pipeline for evaluating prompt-sensitive biases by varying
identity-related terms, enabling causal auditing of how race, gender, and age
affect image generation. To capture interactions, BiasConnect builds causal
graphs diagnosing intersectional biases. Finally, InterMit offers a modular,
training-free algorithm that mitigates intersectional bias via causal
sensitivity scores and user-defined fairness goals.
  Together, these contributions show counterfactuals as a unifying lens for
interpretability, fairness, and causality in both discriminative and generative
models, establishing principled, scalable methods for socially responsible bias
evaluation and mitigation.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle perception typically relies on modular pipelines that
decompose the task into detection, tracking, and prediction. While
interpretable, these pipelines suffer from error accumulation and limited
inter-task synergy. Unified perception has emerged as a promising paradigm that
integrates these sub-tasks within a shared architecture, potentially improving
robustness, contextual reasoning, and efficiency while retaining interpretable
outputs. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of unified
perception, introducing a holistic and systemic taxonomy that categorizes
methods along task integration, tracking formulation, and representation flow.
We define three paradigms -Early, Late, and Full Unified Perception- and
systematically review existing methods, their architectures, training
strategies, datasets used, and open-source availability, while highlighting
future research directions. This work establishes the first comprehensive
framework for understanding and advancing unified perception, consolidates
fragmented efforts, and guides future research toward more robust,
generalizable, and interpretable perception.

Abstract: Mitotic figures (MFs) are relevant biomarkers in tumor grading.
Differentiating atypical MFs (AMFs) from normal MFs (NMFs) remains difficult,
as manual annotation is time-consuming and subjective. In this work an ensemble
of ConvNeXtBase models was trained with AUCMEDI and extend with a rule-based
refinement (RBR) module. On the MIDOG25 preliminary test set, the ensemble
achieved a balanced accuracy of 84.02%. While the RBR increased specificity, it
reduced sensitivity and overall performance. The results show that deep
ensembles perform well for AMF classification. RBR can increase specific
metrics but requires further research.

Abstract: In the era of Industry 5.0, monitoring human activity is essential for
ensuring both ergonomic safety and overall well-being. While multi-camera
centralized setups improve pose estimation accuracy, they often suffer from
high computational costs and bandwidth requirements, limiting scalability and
real-time applicability. Distributing processing across edge devices can reduce
network bandwidth and computational load. On the other hand, the constrained
resources of edge devices lead to accuracy degradation, and the distribution of
computation leads to temporal and spatial inconsistencies. We address this
challenge by proposing COMETH (Convex Optimization for Multiview Estimation and
Tracking of Humans), a lightweight algorithm for real-time multi-view human
pose fusion that relies on three concepts: it integrates kinematic and
biomechanical constraints to increase the joint positioning accuracy; it
employs convex optimization-based inverse kinematics for spatial fusion; and it
implements a state observer to improve temporal consistency. We evaluate COMETH
on both public and industrial datasets, where it outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in localization, detection, and tracking accuracy. The proposed fusion
pipeline enables accurate and scalable human motion tracking, making it
well-suited for industrial and safety-critical applications. The code is
publicly available at https://github.com/PARCO-LAB/COMETH.

Abstract: Many high-performance networks were not designed with lightweight application
scenarios in mind from the outset, which has greatly restricted their scope of

reduces the parameter scale and network complexity of ConvNeXt by integrating
the Cross Stage Partial Connections mechanism and a series of optimized

performance under different complexity configurations. The three core
innovations of E-ConvNeXt are : (1) integrating the Cross Stage Partial Network

model's network complexity by up to 80%; (2) Optimizing the Stem and Block
structures to enhance the model's feature expression capability and operational
efficiency; (3) Replacing Layer Scale with channel attention. Experimental

Conclusion: 该研究通过智能化数据注释和质量控制有效解决了数据缺乏问题，为图片撰改检测领域提供了可靠的大规模训练数据，具有重要的实践价值

Abstract: Images manipulated using image editing tools can mislead viewers and pose
significant risks to social security. However, accurately localizing the
manipulated regions within an image remains a challenging problem. One of the
main barriers in this area is the high cost of data acquisition and the severe
lack of high-quality annotated datasets. To address this challenge, we
introduce novel methods that mitigate data scarcity by leveraging readily
available web data. We utilize a large collection of manually forged images
from the web, as well as automatically generated annotations derived from a
simpler auxiliary task, constrained image manipulation localization.
Specifically, we introduce a new paradigm CAAAv2, which automatically and
accurately annotates manipulated regions at the pixel level. To further improve
annotation quality, we propose a novel metric, QES, which filters out
unreliable annotations. Through CAAA v2 and QES, we construct MIMLv2, a
large-scale, diverse, and high-quality dataset containing 246,212 manually
forged images with pixel-level mask annotations. This is over 120x larger than
existing handcrafted datasets like IMD20. Additionally, we introduce Object
Jitter, a technique that further enhances model training by generating
high-quality manipulation artifacts. Building on these advances, we develop a
new model, Web-IML, designed to effectively leverage web-scale supervision for
the image manipulation localization task. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach substantially alleviates the data scarcity problem and
significantly improves the performance of various models on multiple real-world
forgery benchmarks. With the proposed web supervision, Web-IML achieves a
striking performance gain of 31% and surpasses previous SOTA TruFor by 24.1
average IoU points. The dataset and code will be made publicly available at

Abstract: Simulating detector responses is a crucial part of understanding the inner
workings of particle collisions in the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. Such
simulations are currently performed with statistical Monte Carlo methods, which
are computationally expensive and put a significant strain on CERN's
computational grid. Therefore, recent proposals advocate for generative machine
learning methods to enable more efficient simulations. However, the
distribution of the data varies significantly across the simulations, which is
hard to capture with out-of-the-box methods. In this study, we present
ExpertSim - a deep learning simulation approach tailored for the Zero Degree
Calorimeter in the ALICE experiment. Our method utilizes a
Mixture-of-Generative-Experts architecture, where each expert specializes in
simulating a different subset of the data. This allows for a more precise and
efficient generation process, as each expert focuses on a specific aspect of
the calorimeter response. ExpertSim not only improves accuracy, but also
provides a significant speedup compared to the traditional Monte-Carlo methods,
offering a promising solution for high-efficiency detector simulations in
particle physics experiments at CERN. We make the code available at

Conclusion: 该方法通过显式因果推理实现了更透明、逻辑一致的推理，CCE可作为跨领域可重用的因果推理引擎

Abstract: Existing Causal-Why Video Question Answering (VideoQA) models often struggle
with higher-order reasoning, relying on opaque, monolithic pipelines that
entangle video understanding, causal inference, and answer generation. These
black-box approaches offer limited interpretability and tend to depend on
shallow heuristics. We propose a novel, modular framework that explicitly
decouples causal reasoning from answer generation, introducing natural language
causal chains as interpretable intermediate representations. Inspired by human
cognitive models, these structured cause-effect sequences bridge low-level
video content with high-level causal reasoning, enabling transparent and
logically coherent inference. Our two-stage architecture comprises a Causal
Chain Extractor (CCE) that generates causal chains from video-question pairs,
and a Causal Chain-Driven Answerer (CCDA) that produces answers grounded in
these chains. To address the lack of annotated reasoning traces, we introduce a
scalable method for generating high-quality causal chains from existing
datasets using large language models. We also propose CauCo, a new evaluation
metric for causality-oriented captioning. Experiments on three large-scale
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms state-of-the-art
models, but also yields substantial gains in explainability, user trust, and
generalization -- positioning the CCE as a reusable causal reasoning engine
across diverse domains. Project page:

Motivation: 现有视频加速方法存在根本性限制：既不建模视频帧的时间连贯性，也无法为大规模视频模型提供单步蒸馏，导致采样效率低下。

Method: 采用两阶段蒸馏过程：1）稳定性预热机制稳定对抗蒸馏；2）统一对抗均衡机制促进稳定单步对抗训练；对于条件视频生成还提出了条件对抗一致性方法。

Conclusion: POSE成功解决了大规模视频扩散模型的采样效率瓶颈，实现了高质量单步视频生成，在保持性能的同时显著降低了计算延迟。

Abstract: The field of video diffusion generation faces critical bottlenecks in
sampling efficiency, especially for large-scale models and long sequences.
Existing video acceleration methods adopt image-based techniques but suffer
from fundamental limitations: they neither model the temporal coherence of
video frames nor provide single-step distillation for large-scale video models.
To bridge this gap, we propose POSE (Phased One-Step Equilibrium), a
distillation framework that reduces the sampling steps of large-scale video
diffusion models, enabling the generation of high-quality videos in a single
step. POSE employs a carefully designed two-phase process to distill video
models:(i) stability priming: a warm-up mechanism to stabilize adversarial
distillation that adapts the high-quality trajectory of the one-step generator
from high to low signal-to-noise ratio regimes, optimizing the video quality of
single-step mappings near the endpoints of flow trajectories. (ii) unified
adversarial equilibrium: a flexible self-adversarial distillation mechanism
that promotes stable single-step adversarial training towards a Nash
equilibrium within the Gaussian noise space, generating realistic single-step
videos close to real videos. For conditional video generation, we propose (iii)
conditional adversarial consistency, a method to improve both semantic
consistency and frame consistency between conditional frames and generated
frames. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that POSE outperforms other
acceleration methods on VBench-I2V by average 7.15% in semantic alignment,
temporal conference and frame quality, reducing the latency of the pre-trained
model by 100$\times$, from 1000 seconds to 10 seconds, while maintaining
competitive performance.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models enable high-quality image generation but are
computationally expensive. While prior work optimizes per-inference efficiency,
we explore an orthogonal approach: reducing redundancy across correlated
prompts. Our method leverages the coarse-to-fine nature of diffusion models,
where early denoising steps capture shared structures among similar prompts. We
propose a training-free approach that clusters prompts based on semantic
similarity and shares computation in early diffusion steps. Experiments show
that for models trained conditioned on image embeddings, our approach
significantly reduces compute cost while improving image quality. By leveraging
UnClip's text-to-image prior, we enhance diffusion step allocation for greater
efficiency. Our method seamlessly integrates with existing pipelines, scales
with prompt sets, and reduces the environmental and financial burden of
large-scale text-to-image generation. Project page:

Abstract: Labeled handwriting data is often scarce, limiting the effectiveness of
recognition systems that require diverse, style-consistent training samples.
Handwriting synthesis offers a promising solution by generating artificial data
to augment training. However, current methods face two major limitations.
First, most are built on conventional convolutional architectures, which
struggle to model long-range dependencies and complex stroke patterns. Second,
they largely ignore the crucial role of frequency information, which is
essential for capturing fine-grained stylistic and structural details in
handwriting. To address these challenges, we propose FW-GAN, a one-shot
handwriting synthesis framework that generates realistic, writer-consistent
text from a single example. Our generator integrates a phase-aware Wave-MLP to
better capture spatial relationships while preserving subtle stylistic cues. We
further introduce a frequency-guided discriminator that leverages
high-frequency components to enhance the authenticity detection of generated
samples. Additionally, we introduce a novel Frequency Distribution Loss that
aligns the frequency characteristics of synthetic and real handwriting, thereby
enhancing visual fidelity. Experiments on Vietnamese and English handwriting
datasets demonstrate that FW-GAN generates high-quality, style-consistent
handwriting, making it a valuable tool for augmenting data in low-resource
handwriting recognition (HTR) pipelines. Official implementation is available

excessive visual tokens pose a significant computational challenge for
real-world applications. Current methods aim to enhance inference efficiency by
visual token pruning. However, they do not consider the dynamic characteristics
and temporal dependencies of video frames, as they perceive video understanding
as a multi-frame task. To address these challenges, we propose MMG-Vid, a novel
training-free visual token pruning framework that removes redundancy by
Maximizing Marginal Gains at both segment-level and token-level. Specifically,
we first divide the video into segments based on frame similarity, and then
dynamically allocate the token budget for each segment to maximize the marginal
gain of each segment. Subsequently, we propose a temporal-guided DPC algorithm
that jointly models inter-frame uniqueness and intra-frame diversity, thereby
maximizing the marginal gain of each token. By combining both stages, MMG-Vid
can maximize the utilization of the limited token budget, significantly
improving efficiency while maintaining strong performance. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MMG-Vid can maintain over 99.5% of the original
performance, while effectively reducing 75% visual tokens and accelerating the
prefilling stage by 3.9x on LLaVA-OneVision-7B. Code will be released soon.

*Wei Li,Renshan Zhang,Rui Shao,Jie He,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CogVLA是一个认知对齐的视觉-语言-动作框架，通过指令驱动路由和稀疏化技术，在提高效率的同时提升性能，相比OpenVLA减少2.5倍训练成本和2.8倍推理延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言-动作模型需要大量后训练，计算开销大，限制了可扩展性和部署。受人类多模态协调启发，需要更高效的架构。

Method: 采用3阶段渐进架构：1) EFA-Routing注入指令信息选择性聚合视觉token；2) LFP-Routing修剪指令无关的视觉token实现稀疏化；3) V-L-A耦合注意力机制确保压缩感知输入仍能支持准确动作生成。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试和真实机器人任务中分别达到97.4%和70.0%的成功率，性能达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: CogVLA通过认知对齐设计实现了效率与性能的双重提升，为视觉-语言-动作模型提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models built on pre-trained
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) require extensive post-training, resulting in
high computational overhead that limits scalability and deployment.We propose
CogVLA, a Cognition-Aligned Vision-Language-Action framework that leverages
instruction-driven routing and sparsification to improve both efficiency and
performance. CogVLA draws inspiration from human multimodal coordination and
introduces a 3-stage progressive architecture. 1) Encoder-FiLM based
Aggregation Routing (EFA-Routing) injects instruction information into the
vision encoder to selectively aggregate and compress dual-stream visual tokens,
forming a instruction-aware latent representation. 2) Building upon this
compact visual encoding, LLM-FiLM based Pruning Routing (LFP-Routing)
introduces action intent into the language model by pruning
instruction-irrelevant visually grounded tokens, thereby achieving token-level
sparsity. 3) To ensure that compressed perception inputs can still support
accurate and coherent action generation, we introduce V-L-A Coupled Attention
(CAtten), which combines causal vision-language attention with bidirectional
action parallel decoding. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark and
real-world robotic tasks demonstrate that CogVLA achieves state-of-the-art
performance with success rates of 97.4% and 70.0%, respectively, while reducing
training costs by 2.5-fold and decreasing inference latency by 2.8-fold
compared to OpenVLA. CogVLA is open-sourced and publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出了HydraFake数据集和Veritas检测器，通过多模态大语言模型和模式感知推理解决深度伪造检测在现实场景中的泛化问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学术基准与工业实践存在严重差异，训练源同质化且测试图像质量低，阻碍了检测器的实际部署

Method: 构建HydraFake数据集模拟现实挑战，提出Veritas多模态大语言模型检测器，采用模式感知推理（规划和自我反思）和两阶段训练流程

Result: 实验显示先前检测器在跨模型场景表现良好，但在未见伪造技术和数据域上不足；Veritas在不同OOD场景中取得显著提升，并能提供透明可信的检测输出

Conclusion: HydraFake数据集和Veritas检测器有效解决了深度伪造检测在现实世界中的泛化挑战，为实际部署提供了有力支持

Abstract: Deepfake detection remains a formidable challenge due to the complex and
evolving nature of fake content in real-world scenarios. However, existing
academic benchmarks suffer from severe discrepancies from industrial practice,
typically featuring homogeneous training sources and low-quality testing
images, which hinder the practical deployments of current detectors. To
mitigate this gap, we introduce HydraFake, a dataset that simulates real-world
challenges with hierarchical generalization testing. Specifically, HydraFake
involves diversified deepfake techniques and in-the-wild forgeries, along with
rigorous training and evaluation protocol, covering unseen model architectures,
emerging forgery techniques and novel data domains. Building on this resource,
we propose Veritas, a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) based deepfake
detector. Different from vanilla chain-of-thought (CoT), we introduce
pattern-aware reasoning that involves critical reasoning patterns such as
"planning" and "self-reflection" to emulate human forensic process. We further
propose a two-stage training pipeline to seamlessly internalize such deepfake
reasoning capacities into current MLLMs. Experiments on HydraFake dataset
reveal that although previous detectors show great generalization on
cross-model scenarios, they fall short on unseen forgeries and data domains.
Our Veritas achieves significant gains across different OOD scenarios, and is
capable of delivering transparent and faithful detection outputs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FakeParts是一种新型深度伪造技术，通过局部修改真实视频的特定区域或时间段来制造更隐蔽的伪造内容，现有检测方法对其效果显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度伪造检测主要针对完全合成的视频，但局部伪造内容与真实元素无缝融合，更具欺骗性且难以检测，现有检测能力存在严重不足。

Method: 提出了FakePartsBench基准数据集，包含超过25,000个视频，提供像素级和帧级操作标注，用于全面评估检测方法。通过用户研究和现有检测模型测试验证效果。

Result: 实验显示FakeParts使人类检测准确率相比传统深度伪造降低30%以上，最先进的检测模型也出现类似性能下降。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了当前深度伪造检测方法的严重漏洞，并为开发针对局部视频操作的更鲁棒检测方法提供了必要资源。

Abstract: We introduce FakeParts, a new class of deepfakes characterized by subtle,
localized manipulations to specific spatial regions or temporal segments of
otherwise authentic videos. Unlike fully synthetic content, these partial
manipulations, ranging from altered facial expressions to object substitutions
and background modifications, blend seamlessly with real elements, making them
particularly deceptive and difficult to detect. To address the critical gap in
detection capabilities, we present FakePartsBench, the first large-scale
benchmark dataset specifically designed to capture the full spectrum of partial
deepfakes. Comprising over 25K videos with pixel-level and frame-level
manipulation annotations, our dataset enables comprehensive evaluation of
detection methods. Our user studies demonstrate that FakeParts reduces human
detection accuracy by over 30% compared to traditional deepfakes, with similar
performance degradation observed in state-of-the-art detection models. This
work identifies an urgent vulnerability in current deepfake detection
approaches and provides the necessary resources to develop more robust methods
for partial video manipulations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的单目踪踪器存在深度歧义和遮挡问题，而传统多摄像头方法需要过20个以上摄像头且需要每个序列的优化，故需要开发一种更实用的多视角3D踪踪方法

Method: 使用已知摄像头姿态和深度信息，将多视角特征融合成统一点云，采用k近邻相关性和转换器类更新机制来估计长程3D对应关系

Result: 在Panoptic Studio和DexYCB两个真实数据集上分别达到了3.1cm和2.0cm的中位数轨迹误差，能够良好地1-8个摄像头和24-150帧的视频长度上进行泛化

Conclusion: 该方法为多视角3D踪踪领域设立了新标准，提供了一种实用的工具，相关代码和数据集已开源

Abstract: We introduce the first data-driven multi-view 3D point tracker, designed to
track arbitrary points in dynamic scenes using multiple camera views. Unlike
existing monocular trackers, which struggle with depth ambiguities and
occlusion, or prior multi-camera methods that require over 20 cameras and
tedious per-sequence optimization, our feed-forward model directly predicts 3D
correspondences using a practical number of cameras (e.g., four), enabling
robust and accurate online tracking. Given known camera poses and either
sensor-based or estimated multi-view depth, our tracker fuses multi-view
features into a unified point cloud and applies k-nearest-neighbors correlation
alongside a transformer-based update to reliably estimate long-range 3D
correspondences, even under occlusion. We train on 5K synthetic multi-view
Kubric sequences and evaluate on two real-world benchmarks: Panoptic Studio and
DexYCB, achieving median trajectory errors of 3.1 cm and 2.0 cm, respectively.
Our method generalizes well to diverse camera setups of 1-8 views with varying
vantage points and video lengths of 24-150 frames. By releasing our tracker
alongside training and evaluation datasets, we aim to set a new standard for
multi-view 3D tracking research and provide a practical tool for real-world
applications. Project page available at https://ethz-vlg.github.io/mvtracker.

TL;DR: OneReward是一个统一的强化学习框架，使用单一奖励模型提升多任务生成能力，在图像编辑任务中表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多任务生成方法通常需要针对特定任务进行监督微调，限制了泛化能力和训练效率，需要一种统一的奖励框架来解决这个问题

Method: 使用单一视觉语言模型作为生成奖励模型，通过多任务强化学习直接训练预训练基础模型，无需任务特定的监督微调

Result: 实验结果表明，统一的编辑模型在多个评估维度上均优于商业和开源竞争对手，如Ideogram、Adobe Photoshop和FLUX Fill [Pro]

Conclusion: OneReward框架证明了使用单一奖励模型可以有效提升多任务生成能力，为多任务强化学习提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce OneReward, a unified reinforcement learning
framework that enhances the model's generative capabilities across multiple
tasks under different evaluation criteria using only \textit{One Reward} model.
By employing a single vision-language model (VLM) as the generative reward
model, which can distinguish the winner and loser for a given task and a given
evaluation criterion, it can be effectively applied to multi-task generation
models, particularly in contexts with varied data and diverse task objectives.
We utilize OneReward for mask-guided image generation, which can be further
divided into several sub-tasks such as image fill, image extend, object
removal, and text rendering, involving a binary mask as the edit area. Although
these domain-specific tasks share same conditioning paradigm, they differ
significantly in underlying data distributions and evaluation metrics. Existing
methods often rely on task-specific supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which limits
generalization and training efficiency. Building on OneReward, we develop
Seedream 3.0 Fill, a mask-guided generation model trained via multi-task
reinforcement learning directly on a pre-trained base model, eliminating the
need for task-specific SFT. Experimental results demonstrate that our unified
edit model consistently outperforms both commercial and open-source
competitors, such as Ideogram, Adobe Photoshop, and FLUX Fill [Pro], across
multiple evaluation dimensions. Code and model are available at:

Conclusion: Dress&Dance提供了一个高质量且灵活的虚拟试穿体验，通过创新的CondNet架构和多阶段训练策略，成功解决了多模态输入统一和动作保真度的挑战。

Abstract: We present Dress&Dance, a video diffusion framework that generates high
quality 5-second-long 24 FPS virtual try-on videos at 1152x720 resolution of a
user wearing desired garments while moving in accordance with a given reference
video. Our approach requires a single user image and supports a range of tops,
bottoms, and one-piece garments, as well as simultaneous tops and bottoms
try-on in a single pass. Key to our framework is CondNet, a novel conditioning
network that leverages attention to unify multi-modal inputs (text, images, and

trained on heterogeneous training data, combining limited video data and a
larger, more readily available image dataset, in a multistage progressive
manner. Dress&Dance outperforms existing open source and commercial solutions

TL;DR: 本文提出了在NeurIPS 2024 Erasing the Invisible挑战赛中获胜的水印去除方案，针对黑盒和灰盒场景分别设计了不同的攻击方法，实现了95.7%的近完美水印去除率且保持图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数字水印技术在对抗性攻击下的鲁棒性不明确，需要通过挑战赛来测试水印在各种对手知识程度下的稳健性。

Method: 灰盒跟踪：使用自适应VAE规避攻击，结合测试时优化和CIELAB空间的颜色对比度恢复；黑盒跟踪：基于空间或频域伪影聚类图像，然后对每个聚类应用带控制噪声注入的图像到图像扩散模型，并利用ChatGPT生成的语义先验。

Result: 经验评估表明，该方法成功实现了近完美水印去除（95.7%），对剩余图像质量影响可忽略不计。

Conclusion: 希望这些攻击方法能够激发更鲁棒的图像水印技术的发展。

Abstract: Content watermarking is an important tool for the authentication and
copyright protection of digital media. However, it is unclear whether existing
watermarks are robust against adversarial attacks. We present the winning
solution to the NeurIPS 2024 Erasing the Invisible challenge, which
stress-tests watermark robustness under varying degrees of adversary knowledge.
The challenge consisted of two tracks: a black-box and beige-box track,
depending on whether the adversary knows which watermarking method was used by
the provider. For the beige-box track, we leverage an adaptive VAE-based
evasion attack, with a test-time optimization and color-contrast restoration in
CIELAB space to preserve the image's quality. For the black-box track, we first
cluster images based on their artifacts in the spatial or frequency-domain.
Then, we apply image-to-image diffusion models with controlled noise injection
and semantic priors from ChatGPT-generated captions to each cluster with
optimized parameter settings. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method
successfully achieves near-perfect watermark removal (95.7%) with negligible
impact on the residual image's quality. We hope that our attacks inspire the
development of more robust image watermarking methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期肺癌检测依赖于CT扫描中肺结节的精确体积评估，传统方法如CTR和球形近似法因结节形状和密度变化导致估计不一致

Method: 使用多尺度3D卷积神经网络结合亚型特异性偏差校正进行精确体积估计，在364例上海胸科医院数据集上训练和评估

Result: 平均绝对偏差为8.0%，推理时间低于20秒/扫描，相比现有深度学习和半自动化流程（误差25-30%，处理时间60+秒）有显著提升

Conclusion: 该方法提供了高精度、高效且可扩展的临床肺结节筛查和监测工具，对改善早期肺癌检测具有良好潜力

Abstract: Early detection of lung cancer is crucial for effective treatment and relies
on accurate volumetric assessment of pulmonary nodules in CT scans. Traditional
methods, such as consolidation-to-tumor ratio (CTR) and spherical
approximation, are limited by inconsistent estimates due to variability in
nodule shape and density. We propose an advanced framework that combines a
multi-scale 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) with subtype-specific bias
correction for precise volume estimation. The model was trained and evaluated
on a dataset of 364 cases from Shanghai Chest Hospital. Our approach achieved a
mean absolute deviation of 8.0 percent compared to manual nonlinear regression,
with inference times under 20 seconds per scan. This method outperforms
existing deep learning and semi-automated pipelines, which typically have
errors of 25 to 30 percent and require over 60 seconds for processing. Our
results show a reduction in error by over 17 percentage points and a threefold
acceleration in processing speed. These advancements offer a highly accurate,
efficient, and scalable tool for clinical lung nodule screening and monitoring,
with promising potential for improving early lung cancer detection.

Motivation: 解决在有限标注数据情况下实现鲁棒3D语义分割的挑战，特别是在未铺装道路等复杂场景中的分割问题

Method: 两阶段训练框架：1）在多源数据集上预训练投影式CNN；2）仅使用域内数据微调轻量级预测头。探索了Point Prompt Training、Manifold Mixup正则化和直方图归一化环境光等技术

Result: 仅使用50个标注点云，mIoU从33.5%提升至51.8%，整体准确率从85.5%提升至90.8%，显著优于直接在域内数据上训练的方法

Conclusion: 跨数据集预训练是提升泛化能力和在有限监督下实现鲁棒分割的关键，该研究为低数据场景下的实用3D语义分割提供了有效框架

Abstract: In this case study, we present a data-efficient point cloud segmentation
pipeline and training framework for robust segmentation of unimproved roads and
seven other classes. Our method employs a two-stage training framework: first,
a projection-based convolutional neural network is pre-trained on a mixture of
public urban datasets and a small, curated in-domain dataset; then, a
lightweight prediction head is fine-tuned exclusively on in-domain data. Along
the way, we explore the application of Point Prompt Training to batch
normalization layers and the effects of Manifold Mixup as a regularizer within
our pipeline. We also explore the effects of incorporating histogram-normalized
ambients to further boost performance. Using only 50 labeled point clouds from
our target domain, we show that our proposed training approach improves mean
Intersection-over-Union from 33.5% to 51.8% and the overall accuracy from 85.5%
to 90.8%, when compared to naive training on the in-domain data. Crucially, our
results demonstrate that pre-training across multiple datasets is key to
improving generalization and enabling robust segmentation under limited
in-domain supervision. Overall, this study demonstrates a practical framework
for robust 3D semantic segmentation in challenging, low-data scenarios. Our

Motivation: 现有动态场景插值方法假设相邻时间步之间的运动较小，但实际应用中即使轻微偏离这个假设也会导致传统技术失败，需要处理大运动场景

Method: 提出Global Motion Corresponder (GMC)方法，学习一元势场预测SE(3)映射到共享规范空间，平衡对应关系、空间和语义平滑性以及局部刚性

Result: 在经历大全局运动的3D场景插值任务中显著优于现有基线方法，并具备其他基线方法无法实现的外推能力

Conclusion: GMC方法能够鲁棒地处理大运动并实现平滑过渡，为动态场景插值提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Existing dynamic scene interpolation methods typically assume that the motion
between consecutive timesteps is small enough so that displacements can be
locally approximated by linear models. In practice, even slight deviations from
this small-motion assumption can cause conventional techniques to fail. In this
paper, we introduce Global Motion Corresponder (GMC), a novel approach that
robustly handles large motion and achieves smooth transitions. GMC learns unary
potential fields that predict SE(3) mappings into a shared canonical space,
balancing correspondence, spatial and semantic smoothness, and local rigidity.
We demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines on
3D scene interpolation when the two states undergo large global motions.
Furthermore, our method enables extrapolation capabilities where other baseline
methods cannot.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation has advanced rapidly over the past two decades,
largely driven by deep learning, which has enabled accurate and efficient
delineation of cells, tissues, organs, and pathologies across diverse imaging
modalities. This progress raises a fundamental question: to what extent have
current models overcome persistent challenges, and what gaps remain? In this
work, we provide an in-depth review of medical image segmentation, tracing its
progress and key developments over the past decade. We examine core principles,
including multiscale analysis, attention mechanisms, and the integration of
prior knowledge, across the encoder, bottleneck, skip connections, and decoder
components of segmentation networks. Our discussion is organized around seven
key dimensions: (1) the shift from supervised to semi-/unsupervised learning,
(2) the transition from organ segmentation to lesion-focused tasks, (3)
advances in multi-modality integration and domain adaptation, (4) the role of
foundation models and transfer learning, (5) the move from deterministic to
probabilistic segmentation, (6) the progression from 2D to 3D and 4D
segmentation, and (7) the trend from model invocation to segmentation agents.
Together, these perspectives provide a holistic overview of the trajectory of
deep learning-based medical image segmentation and aim to inspire future
innovation. To support ongoing research, we maintain a continually updated

compositing techniques. Unlike approaches such as chroma keying and trained AI
models, LiDAR's depth information is independent of subject lighting, and
performs equally well in low-light and well-lit environments. We integrate the
LiDAR and color cameras on the iPhone 15 Pro Max with GPU-based image
processing. We use Apple's SwiftUI and Swift frameworks for user interface and
backend development, and Metal Shader Language (MSL) for realtime image
enhancement at the standard iPhone streaming frame rate of 60 frames per
second. The only meaningful limitations of the technology are the streaming
bandwidth of the depth data, which currently reduces the depth map resolution
to 320x240, and any pre-existing limitations of the LiDAR IR laser to reflect
accurate depth from some materials. If the LiDAR resolution on a mobile device
like the iPhone can be improved to match the color image resolution, LiDAR
could feasibly become the preeminent method of background removal for video
applications and photography.

TL;DR: GENRE-CMR是一种基于GAN的生成对抗网络架构，采用残差深度展开重建框架，结合边缘感知区域损失和统计分布对齐损失，显著提升心脏磁共振图像重建质量和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决加速心脏磁共振成像中扫描时间与图像质量之间的权衡问题，特别是在不同采集设置下的泛化能力挑战。

Method: 使用生成对抗网络(GAN)架构，采用残差深度展开重建框架，集成边缘感知区域(EAR)损失和统计分布对齐(SDA)损失来提升重建保真度和泛化性。

Result: 在未见数据上达到0.9552 SSIM和38.90 dB PSNR，超越了现有最先进方法，在各种加速因子和采样轨迹下表现优异。

Conclusion: 该框架为高质量心脏磁共振重建提供了统一且稳健的解决方案，为临床适应性部署铺平了道路。

Abstract: Accelerated Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (CMR) image reconstruction
remains a critical challenge due to the trade-off between scan time and image
quality, particularly when generalizing across diverse acquisition settings. We
propose GENRE-CMR, a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based architecture
employing a residual deep unrolled reconstruction framework to enhance
reconstruction fidelity and generalization. The architecture unrolls iterative
optimization into a cascade of convolutional subnetworks, enriched with
residual connections to enable progressive feature propagation from shallow to
deeper stages. To further improve performance, we integrate two loss functions:
(1) an Edge-Aware Region (EAR) loss, which guides the network to focus on
structurally informative regions and helps prevent common reconstruction
blurriness; and (2) a Statistical Distribution Alignment (SDA) loss, which
regularizes the feature space across diverse data distributions via a symmetric
KL divergence formulation. Extensive experiments confirm that GENRE-CMR
surpasses state-of-the-art methods on training and unseen data, achieving
0.9552 SSIM and 38.90 dB PSNR on unseen distributions across various
acceleration factors and sampling trajectories. Ablation studies confirm the
contribution of each proposed component to reconstruction quality and
generalization. Our framework presents a unified and robust solution for
high-quality CMR reconstruction, paving the way for clinically adaptable
deployment across heterogeneous acquisition protocols.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: DINOv3-H+视觉变换器通过LoRA微调和数据增强，在MIDOG 2025挑战中实现了0.8871的平衡准确率，为异常有丝分裂分类提供了强基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异常有丝分裂图形(AMFs)是预后不良的标志，但由于低发生率、形态细微和观察者间变异性，检测困难。MIDOG 2025挑战旨在建立跨域AMF分类基准。

Method: 使用在自然图像上预训练的DINOv3-H+视觉变换器，通过低秩适应(LoRA，65万可训练参数)进行微调，并采用广泛的数据增强技术。

Result: 尽管存在领域差距，DINOv3在组织病理学图像上有效迁移，在初步测试集上达到0.8871的平衡准确率。

Conclusion: DINOv3预训练表现出强大鲁棒性，结合参数高效微调，为MIDOG 2025的异常有丝分裂分类提供了强有力的基准方法。

Abstract: Atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) are markers of abnormal cell division
associated with poor prognosis, yet their detection remains difficult due to
low prevalence, subtle morphology, and inter-observer variability. The MIDOG
2025 challenge introduces a benchmark for AMF classification across multiple
domains. In this work, we evaluate the recently published DINOv3-H+ vision
transformer, pretrained on natural images, which we fine-tuned using low-rank
adaptation (LoRA, 650k trainable parameters) and extensive augmentation.
Despite the domain gap, DINOv3 transfers effectively to histopathology,
achieving a balanced accuracy of 0.8871 on the preliminary test set. These
results highlight the robustness of DINOv3 pretraining and show that, when
combined with parameter-efficient fine-tuning, it provides a strong baseline
for atypical mitosis classification in MIDOG 2025.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Mixture of Contexts (MoC)的稀疏注意力路由模块，用于解决长视频生成中的长上下文记忆问题，通过动态选择信息块和强制锚点来实现高效的长时记忆检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频生成本质上是一个长上下文记忆问题，需要模型在不崩溃或漂移的情况下跨长范围保留和检索显著事件。然而，扩散变换器的二次自注意力成本使得内存和计算难以处理，限制了长序列的优化。

Method: 将长上下文视频生成重新定义为内部信息检索任务，提出可学习的稀疏注意力路由模块MoC。每个查询动态选择少量信息块加上强制锚点（标题、局部窗口）进行关注，采用因果路由防止循环闭合。

Result: 随着数据规模的扩大和路由的逐渐稀疏化，模型将计算资源分配给显著的历史信息，在数分钟的内容中保持身份、动作和场景的一致性。效率作为检索的副产品（接近线性扩展），实现了实用的训练和合成。

Conclusion: MoC模块有效地解决了长视频生成中的记忆和一致性挑战，在分钟级别上实现了内存和一致性的涌现，为长上下文视频生成提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Long video generation is fundamentally a long context memory problem: models
must retain and retrieve salient events across a long range without collapsing
or drifting. However, scaling diffusion transformers to generate long-context
videos is fundamentally limited by the quadratic cost of self-attention, which
makes memory and computation intractable and difficult to optimize for long
sequences. We recast long-context video generation as an internal information
retrieval task and propose a simple, learnable sparse attention routing module,
Mixture of Contexts (MoC), as an effective long-term memory retrieval engine.
In MoC, each query dynamically selects a few informative chunks plus mandatory
anchors (caption, local windows) to attend to, with causal routing that
prevents loop closures. As we scale the data and gradually sparsify the
routing, the model allocates compute to salient history, preserving identities,
actions, and scenes over minutes of content. Efficiency follows as a byproduct
of retrieval (near-linear scaling), which enables practical training and
synthesis, and the emergence of memory and consistency at the scale of minutes.

Main category: physics.geo-ph

TL;DR: 该论文开发了一种基于稀疏促进时频滤波(SP-TFF)的方法，通过设计定向滤波器组来分离被面波掩盖的体波信号，利用偏振信息提高地震相位识别能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地震体波研究面临的关键挑战是低振幅的P波和S波通常被时间和频率上重叠的面波所掩盖，传统滤波方法效果有限，需要先进的信号处理技术来解决这一问题。

Method: 开发了SP-TFF方法的扩展版本，设计了一套基于预测地震射线入射角的定向滤波器组，整合振幅、方向性和直线性信息，在时频域中利用高分辨率偏振信息来增强相位识别。

Result: 通过在合成测试和2021年墨西哥格雷罗Mw 7.0地震的实际波形数据上进行评估，证明该方法能够有效提取被高振幅面波掩盖的体波能量，并抑制干扰相位。

Conclusion: SP-TFF为自动体波提取提供了一个强大的计算框架，成功将偏振信息驱动的滤波技术集成到地震学数据处理流程中，提高了体波信号分离的效果。

Abstract: Seismic waves generated by earthquakes consist of multiple phases that carry
critical information about Earth's internal structure as they propagate through
heterogeneous media. These phases provide constraints from different regions of
the Earth, such as the crust, mantle, and even the cores. The choice of phase
depends on the study target and scientific objective: surface waves are suited
for imaging shallow structures, whereas body waves yield higher-resolution
information at depth. A key challenge in body-wave studies is that the
low-amplitude P and S arrivals are often masked by surface waves overlapping in
both time and frequency. Although body waves typically contain higher-frequency
content, their spectral overlap with surface waves limits the effectiveness of
conventional filtering approaches. Addressing this issue requires advanced
signal-processing techniques. One such method, Sparsity-Promoting
Time-Frequency Filtering (SP-TFF, Mohammadigheymasi et al., 2022), exploits
high-resolution polarization information in the time-frequency domain. SP-TFF
integrates amplitude, directivity, and rectilinearity to enhance phase
discrimination. Here, we further develop SP-TFF by designing a filter set
tailored to isolate body-wave arrivals otherwise masked by high-amplitude
surface waves. The directivity filters are constructed from predicted seismic
ray incidence angles, enabling focused extraction of body-wave energy and
suppression of interfering phases. We evaluate the method on both synthetic
tests and waveform data from the Mw 7.0 Guerrero, Mexico, earthquake of
September 8, 2021, recorded by the United States National Seismic Network
(USNSN). Our results show that SP-TFF provides a robust computational framework
for automated body-wave extraction, integrating polarization-informed filtering
into seismological data-processing pipelines.

TL;DR: 一种基于深度学习的多模态框架，通过整合CT图像、政教学和临床数据来预测头颈鱼相细胞瘤的转移风险，表现出超过单一模态的预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 头颈鱼相细胞瘤转移是临床治疗的主要挑战，需要可靠的治疗前转移风险预测来优化治疗策略和预后。

Method: 使用3D Swin Transformer从肿瘤区域提取深度特征，PyRadiomics获取1562个政教学特征并通过相关性筛选和随机森林选择36个特征，结合临床变量，通过全连接网络进行多模态融合预测。

Result: 融合模型的AUC达到0.803，准确度0.752，敏感性0.730，特异性0.758，显著超过单一模态模型的性能，并在不同肿瘤子型中都表现出良好的通用性。

Conclusion: 该多模态融合模型能够准确地预测HNSCC的转移风险，为个性化治疗规划提供了可解释的临床决策支持工具。

Abstract: Metastasis remains the major challenge in the clinical management of head and
neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Reliable pre-treatment prediction of
metastatic risk is crucial for optimizing treatment strategies and prognosis.
This study develops a deep learning-based multimodal framework to predict
metastasis risk in HNSCC patients by integrating computed tomography (CT)
images, radiomics, and clinical data. 1497 HNSCC patients were included. Tumor
and organ masks were derived from pretreatment CT images. A 3D Swin Transformer
extracted deep features from tumor regions. Meanwhile, 1562 radiomics features
were obtained using PyRadiomics, followed by correlation filtering and random
forest selection, leaving 36 features. Clinical variables including age, sex,
smoking, and alcohol status were encoded and fused with imaging-derived
features. Multimodal features were fed into a fully connected network to
predict metastasis risk. Performance was evaluated using five-fold
cross-validation with area under the curve (AUC), accuracy (ACC), sensitivity
(SEN), and specificity (SPE). The proposed fusion model outperformed
single-modality models. The 3D deep learning module alone achieved an AUC of
0.715, and when combined with radiomics and clinical features, predictive
performance improved (AUC = 0.803, ACC = 0.752, SEN = 0.730, SPE = 0.758).
Stratified analysis showed generalizability across tumor subtypes. Ablation
studies indicated complementary information from different modalities.
Evaluation showed the 3D Swin Transformer provided more robust representation
learning than conventional networks. This multimodal fusion model demonstrated
high accuracy and robustness in predicting metastasis risk in HNSCC, offering a
comprehensive representation of tumor biology. The interpretable model has
potential as a clinical decision-support tool for personalized treatment
planning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GUARD是一个将政府AI伦理指南转化为可操作测试问题的框架，通过自动生成违反指南的问题来评估LLM合规性，并引入越狱诊断来识别潜在安全漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在各领域的广泛应用，其可能生成有害内容的风险引发了社会关注。政府发布的伦理指南缺乏具体测试方法，需要将高层次要求转化为可操作的测试问题。

Method: GUARD通过自动生成违反指南的问题来测试LLM响应合规性，并开发GUARD-JD模块利用越狱技术创建场景来触发不道德响应，识别安全机制绕过漏洞。

Result: 在7个主流LLM上验证有效性，包括Vicuna、Llama系列和GPT系列模型，测试了三个政府指南的合规性，并能将越狱诊断扩展到视觉语言模型。

Conclusion: GUARD提供了一种系统化的方法来评估LLM对伦理指南的遵守程度，有助于促进可靠AI应用的发展，并能识别传统测试方法可能遗漏的安全漏洞。

Abstract: As Large Language Models become increasingly integral to various domains,
their potential to generate harmful responses has prompted significant societal
and regulatory concerns. In response, governments have issued ethics guidelines
to promote the development of trustworthy AI. However, these guidelines are
typically high-level demands for developers and testers, leaving a gap in
translating them into actionable testing questions to verify LLM compliance.
  To address this challenge, we introduce GUARD (\textbf{G}uideline
\textbf{U}pholding Test through \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{R}ole-play and
Jailbreak \textbf{D}iagnostics), a testing method designed to operationalize
guidelines into specific guideline-violating questions that assess LLM
adherence. To implement this, GUARD uses automated generation of
guideline-violating questions based on government-issued guidelines, thereby
testing whether responses comply with these guidelines. When responses directly
violate guidelines, GUARD reports inconsistencies. Furthermore, for responses
that do not directly violate guidelines, GUARD integrates the concept of
``jailbreaks'' to diagnostics, named GUARD-JD, which creates scenarios that
provoke unethical or guideline-violating responses, effectively identifying
potential scenarios that could bypass built-in safety mechanisms. Our method
finally culminates in a compliance report, delineating the extent of adherence
and highlighting any violations.
  We have empirically validated the effectiveness of GUARD on seven LLMs,
including Vicuna-13B, LongChat-7B, Llama2-7B, Llama-3-8B, GPT-3.5, GPT-4,
GPT-4o, and Claude-3.7, by testing compliance under three government-issued
guidelines and conducting jailbreak diagnostics. Additionally, GUARD-JD can
transfer jailbreak diagnostics to vision-language models, demonstrating its
usage in promoting reliable LLM-based applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器学习模型遗忘特定训练数据的需求，避免昂贵的重新训练过程，特别是在大规模数据集（如ImageNet1k）上重新训练不切实际的现实场景。

Method: LoTUS通过平滑模型的预测概率至信息理论边界，减轻因数据记忆导致的过度自信问题，并引入了无需重新训练的Jensen-Shannon散度（RF-JSD）评估指标。

Result: 在Transformer和ResNet18模型上，使用五个公共数据集与八个基线方法进行比较，LoTUS在效率和效果方面均优于最先进的方法，特别是在大规模ImageNet1k数据集上表现突出。

Conclusion: LoTUS提供了一种有效的机器学习遗忘解决方案，能够在现实世界条件下高效消除训练数据的影响，无需重新训练，具有重要的实际应用价值。

Abstract: We present LoTUS, a novel Machine Unlearning (MU) method that eliminates the
influence of training samples from pre-trained models, avoiding retraining from
scratch. LoTUS smooths the prediction probabilities of the model up to an
information-theoretic bound, mitigating its over-confidence stemming from data
memorization. We evaluate LoTUS on Transformer and ResNet18 models against
eight baselines across five public datasets. Beyond established MU benchmarks,
we evaluate unlearning on ImageNet1k, a large-scale dataset, where retraining
is impractical, simulating real-world conditions. Moreover, we introduce the
novel Retrain-Free Jensen-Shannon Divergence (RF-JSD) metric to enable
evaluation under real-world conditions. The experimental results show that
LoTUS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both efficiency and
effectiveness. Code: https://github.com/cspartalis/LoTUS.

Conclusion: 教师模型的校准是知识蒸馏中一个重要的影响因素，通过简单的校准方法就能显著提升蒸馏效果，为知识蒸馏技术提供了新的优化方向

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) has emerged as an effective model compression
technique in deep learning, enabling the transfer of knowledge from a large
teacher model to a compact student model. While KD has demonstrated significant
success, it is not yet fully understood which factors contribute to improving
the student's performance. In this paper, we reveal a strong correlation
between the teacher's calibration error and the student's accuracy. Therefore,
we claim that the calibration of the teacher model is an important factor for
effective KD. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the performance of KD can be
improved by simply employing a calibration method that reduces the teacher's
calibration error. Our algorithm is versatile, demonstrating effectiveness
across various tasks from classification to detection. Moreover, it can be
easily integrated with existing state-of-the-art methods, consistently
achieving superior performance.

Conclusion: MAE通过可扩展的自监督学习在超声信号分析中具有巨大潜力，能够学习鲁棒表征提升下游任务性能

Abstract: We investigated the adaptation and performance of Masked Autoencoders (MAEs)
with Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures for self-supervised representation
learning on one-dimensional (1D) ultrasound signals. Although MAEs have
demonstrated significant success in computer vision and other domains, their
use for 1D signal analysis, especially for raw ultrasound data, remains largely
unexplored. Ultrasound signals are vital in industrial applications such as
non-destructive testing (NDT) and structural health monitoring (SHM), where
labeled data are often scarce and signal processing is highly task-specific. We
propose an approach that leverages MAE to pre-train on unlabeled synthetic
ultrasound signals, enabling the model to learn robust representations that
enhance performance in downstream tasks, such as time-of-flight (ToF)
classification. This study systematically investigated the impact of model
size, patch size, and masking ratio on pre-training efficiency and downstream
accuracy. Our results show that pre-trained models significantly outperform
models trained from scratch and strong convolutional neural network (CNN)
baselines optimized for the downstream task. Additionally, pre-training on
synthetic data demonstrates superior transferability to real-world measured
signals compared with training solely on limited real datasets. This study
underscores the potential of MAEs for advancing ultrasound signal analysis
through scalable, self-supervised learning.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了泄漏时间常数(LTC)在不同数据模态(静态图像、动态图像、生物信号时间序列)的前馈脉冲神经网络中的关键作用，发现LTC显著影响推理精度、权重分布和脉冲动态，需要针对特定任务进行优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 泄漏时间常数(LTC)作为脉冲神经网络中控制时间信息整合的关键参数，在不同数据模态中的影响尚未得到充分探索，需要研究其在前馈SNN性能中的作用。

Method: 在静态图像、动态图像和生物信号时间序列分类任务中，应用时间自适应前馈脉冲神经网络，系统研究不同LTC值对网络性能的影响。

Result: 实验表明：静态和动态图像任务中，中等LTC值获得更高精度和紧凑的权重分布；时间序列任务中，最优LTC增强时间特征保留并允许LTC变化容忍；推理精度在特定LTC范围内达到峰值；脉冲率分析显示LTC、网络深度和能量效率之间存在强关联。

Conclusion: 任务特定的LTC调优对于高效脉冲编码和稳健学习至关重要，研究结果为硬件感知的SNN优化提供了实用指南，有助于实现可扩展的超低功耗SNN部署。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are promising candidates for low-power edge
computing in domains such as wearable sensing and time-series analysis. A key
neuronal parameter, the leaky time constant (LTC), governs temporal integration
of information in Leaky Integrateand-Fire (LIF) neurons, yet its impact on
feedforward SNN performance across different data modalities remains
underexplored. This study investigates the role of LTC in a temporally adaptive
feedforward SNN applied to static image, dynamic image, and biosignal
time-series classification. Presented experiments demonstrate that LTCs
critically affect inference accuracy, synaptic weight distributions, and firing
dynamics. For static and dynamic images, intermediate LTCs yield higher
accuracy and compact, centered weight histograms, reflecting stable feature
encoding. In time-series tasks, optimal LTCs enhance temporal feature retention
and result in broader weight sparsity, allowing for tolerance of LTC
variations. The provided results show that inference accuracy peaks at specific
LTC ranges, with significant degradation beyond this optimal band due to
over-integration or excessive forgetting. Firing rate analysis reveals a strong
interplay between LTC, network depth, and energy efficiency, underscoring the
importance of balanced spiking activity. These findings reveal that
task-specific LTC tuning is essential for efficient spike coding and robust
learning. The results provide practical guidelines for hardware-aware SNN
optimization and highlight how neuronal time constants can be designed to match
task dynamics. This work contributes toward scalable, ultra-lowpower SNN
deployment for real-time classification tasks in neuromorphic computing.

Abstract: Purpose: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have recently gained attention as
energy-efficient, biologically plausible alternatives to conventional deep
learning models. Their application in high-stakes biomedical imaging remains
almost entirely unexplored. Methods: This study introduces SNNDeep, the first

broad generalizability, the model was developed and evaluated using the
Task03\Liver dataset from the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD), a
standardized benchmark widely used for assessing performance across diverse

algorithms, namely Surrogate Gradient Learning, the Tempotron rule, and
Bio-Inspired Active Learning across three architectural variants: a fully
customized low-level model built from scratch, and two implementations using
leading SNN frameworks, i.e., snnTorch and SpikingJelly. Hyperparameter
optimization was performed using Optuna. Results: Our results demonstrate that
the custom-built SNNDeep consistently outperforms framework-based

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated considerable potential in the
realm of medical imaging. However, the development of high-performance AI
models typically necessitates training on large-scale, centralized datasets.
This approach is confronted with significant challenges due to strict patient
privacy regulations and legal restrictions on data sharing and utilization.
These limitations hinder the development of large-scale models in medical
domains and impede continuous updates and training with new data. Federated
Learning (FL), a privacy-preserving distributed training framework, offers a
new solution by enabling collaborative model development across fragmented
medical datasets. In this survey, we review FL's contributions at two stages of
the full-stack medical analysis pipeline. First, in upstream tasks such as CT
or MRI reconstruction, FL enables joint training of robust reconstruction
networks on diverse, multi-institutional datasets, alleviating data scarcity
while preserving confidentiality. Second, in downstream clinical tasks like
tumor diagnosis and segmentation, FL supports continuous model updating by
allowing local fine-tuning on new data without centralizing sensitive images.
We comprehensively analyze FL implementations across the medical imaging
pipeline, from physics-informed reconstruction networks to diagnostic AI
systems, highlighting innovations that improve communication efficiency, align
heterogeneous data, and ensure secure parameter aggregation. Meanwhile, this
paper provides an outlook on future research directions, aiming to serve as a
valuable reference for the field's development.

Abstract: Real-time human-device interaction in industrial Metaverse faces challenges
such as high computational load, limited bandwidth, and strict latency. This
paper proposes a task-oriented edge-assisted cross-system framework using
digital twins (DTs) to enable responsive interactions. By predicting operator
motions, the system supports: 1) proactive Metaverse rendering for visual
feedback, and 2) preemptive control of remote devices. The DTs are decoupled
into two virtual functions-visual display and robotic control-optimizing both
performance and adaptability. To enhance generalizability, we introduce the
Human-In-The-Loop Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (HITL-MAML) algorithm, which
dynamically adjusts prediction horizons. Evaluation on two tasks demonstrates
the framework's effectiveness: in a Trajectory-Based Drawing Control task, it
reduces weighted RMSE from 0.0712 m to 0.0101 m; in a real-time 3D scene
representation task for nuclear decommissioning, it achieves a PSNR of 22.11,
SSIM of 0.8729, and LPIPS of 0.1298. These results show the framework's
capability to ensure spatial precision and visual fidelity in real-time,
high-risk industrial environments.

Motivation: 现有方法无法在保持可提示性的同时实现低延迟推理，实时交互式动态物体抓取合成仍面临挑战。

Method: 扩展SAMv2模型用于视频流抓取估计，整合用户提示与时空上下文信息，实现端到端的实时交互。

Result: 在OCID上达到90.6%的实例级抓取准确率，Jacquard上93.8%，GraspNet-1Billion连续跟踪下92.0%准确率，延迟73.1ms，比RoG-SAM降低58.5%。真实实验中13个移动物体的交互抓取成功率达94.8%。

Conclusion: SPGrasp有效解决了动态抓取合成中的延迟-交互性权衡问题，实现了实时交互式动态物体抓取。

Abstract: Real-time interactive grasp synthesis for dynamic objects remains challenging
as existing methods fail to achieve low-latency inference while maintaining
promptability. To bridge this gap, we propose SPGrasp (spatiotemporal
prompt-driven dynamic grasp synthesis), a novel framework extending segment
anything model v2 (SAMv2) for video stream grasp estimation. Our core
innovation integrates user prompts with spatiotemporal context, enabling
real-time interaction with end-to-end latency as low as 59 ms while ensuring
temporal consistency for dynamic objects. In benchmark evaluations, SPGrasp
achieves instance-level grasp accuracies of 90.6% on OCID and 93.8% on
Jacquard. On the challenging GraspNet-1Billion dataset under continuous
tracking, SPGrasp achieves 92.0% accuracy with 73.1 ms per-frame latency,
representing a 58.5% reduction compared to the prior state-of-the-art
promptable method RoG-SAM while maintaining competitive accuracy. Real-world
experiments involving 13 moving objects demonstrate a 94.8% success rate in
interactive grasping scenarios. These results confirm SPGrasp effectively
resolves the latency-interactivity trade-off in dynamic grasp synthesis. Code

TL;DR: ActLoc是一个主动视角感知规划框架，通过注意力模型选择最优视角来提升机器人定位精度，在单视角选择和轨迹规划方面达到最先进水平


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有定位系统假设所有视角方向信息量相同，但实践中当机器人观察到未映射、模糊或无信息区域时定位会不可靠

Method: 使用大规模训练的基于注意力的模型进行视角选择，编码度量地图和建图时的相机位姿，预测任意3D位置偏航和俯仰方向的定位精度分布，并将其整合到路径规划器中

Result: 在单视角选择和完整轨迹规划方面取得了最先进的结果，能够有效泛化

Conclusion: ActLoc的模块化设计使其易于应用于各种机器人导航和检测任务，能够主动选择最大化定位鲁棒性的相机朝向

Abstract: Reliable localization is critical for robot navigation, yet most existing
systems implicitly assume that all viewing directions at a location are equally
informative. In practice, localization becomes unreliable when the robot
observes unmapped, ambiguous, or uninformative regions. To address this, we
present ActLoc, an active viewpoint-aware planning framework for enhancing
localization accuracy for general robot navigation tasks. At its core, ActLoc
employs a largescale trained attention-based model for viewpoint selection. The
model encodes a metric map and the camera poses used during map construction,
and predicts localization accuracy across yaw and pitch directions at arbitrary
3D locations. These per-point accuracy distributions are incorporated into a
path planner, enabling the robot to actively select camera orientations that
maximize localization robustness while respecting task and motion constraints.
ActLoc achieves stateof-the-art results on single-viewpoint selection and
generalizes effectively to fulltrajectory planning. Its modular design makes it
readily applicable to diverse robot navigation and inspection tasks.

Abstract: Recent scientific studies have suggested that, in certain physical
configurations, the time-dependent behavior of earthquake rupture and seafloor
(bathymetry) motion can leave observable near-field signatures in tsunami wave
generation and propagation. However, dynamic ground movement is often neglected
in conventional tsunami models, which commonly assume instantaneous ground
displacement (sourcing). This work introduces a pseudo-spectral algorithm for
the solution of the nonlinear shallow water equations with timedependent
seafloor displacement and velocity. Based on a Fourier continuation (FC)
methodology for the accurate trigonometric interpolation of a non-periodic
function, the solver provides high-order convergence in space and time; mild
(linear) Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) constraints for explicit time
integration; and results that are effectively free of numerical dispersion (or
''pollution'') errors. Such properties enable the efficient and robust
resolution of the different space-time scales involved modeling tsunamis
generated by dynamic earthquake ground motion (including over long distances).
Numerical experiments attesting to accuracy and computational performance are
presented with direct comparisons to high-order finite difference
methodologies. The solver is physically validated by a number of classical and
semi-classical benchmark cases based on simulated or experimental data.
Additionally, a seismologically realistic, first-of-its-kind parametric study
based on earthquake speed is introduced, whose results-easily facilitated by
the FC-based approach proposed herein, with minimal numerical tuning-further
demonstrate the potential importance of (and the motivation herein for)
incorporating time-dependent seafloor behavior in quantitative tsunami hazard
assessment.
