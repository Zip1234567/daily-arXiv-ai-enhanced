### [1] [EfficientQuant: An Efficient Post-Training Quantization for CNN-Transformer Hybrid Models on Edge Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11093)
*Shaibal Saha,Lanyu Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EfficientQuant是一种针对混合模型的结构感知后训练量化方法，显著降低延迟且保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混合模型在计算机视觉任务中表现优异，但资源消耗大，难以在边缘设备部署。现有后训练量化方法对混合模型效果有限。

Method: 采用均匀量化处理卷积块，对数量化处理Transformer块。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K数据集上实现2.5×-8.7×的延迟降低，且精度损失极小。

Conclusion: EfficientQuant在边缘设备上表现出低延迟和高效内存使用，适合实际部署。

Abstract: Hybrid models that combine convolutional and transformer blocks offer strong
performance in computer vision (CV) tasks but are resource-intensive for edge
deployment. Although post-training quantization (PTQ) can help reduce resource
demand, its application to hybrid models remains limited. We propose
EfficientQuant, a novel structure-aware PTQ approach that applies uniform
quantization to convolutional blocks and $log_2$ quantization to transformer
blocks. EfficientQuant achieves $2.5 \times - 8.7 \times$ latency reduction
with minimal accuracy loss on the ImageNet-1K dataset. It further demonstrates
low latency and memory efficiency on edge devices, making it practical for
real-world deployment.

### [2] [Monocular 3D Hand Pose Estimation with Implicit Camera Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11133)
*Christos Pantazopoulos,Spyridon Thermos,Gerasimos Potamianos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种从2D关键点估计3D手部关节的优化流程，无需相机参数知识，并在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单色图像中3D手部关节估计的挑战，如深度信息缺失、遮挡和复杂关节结构。

Method: 采用关键点对齐步骤和指尖损失函数，避免对相机参数的依赖。

Result: 在EgoDexter和Dexter+Object基准测试中表现优异，对“野外”图像处理鲁棒。

Conclusion: 该方法在无需相机参数的情况下，实现了与SotA竞争的性能，但2D关键点估计精度仍需关注。

Abstract: Estimating the 3D hand articulation from a single color image is a
continuously investigated problem with applications in Augmented Reality (AR),
Virtual Reality (VR), Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and robotics. Apart
from the absence of depth information, occlusions, articulation complexity, and
the need for camera parameters knowledge pose additional challenges. In this
work, we propose an optimization pipeline for estimating the 3D hand
articulation from 2D keypoint input, which includes a keypoint alignment step
and a fingertip loss to overcome the need to know or estimate the camera
parameters. We evaluate our approach on the EgoDexter and Dexter+Object
benchmarks to showcase that our approach performs competitively with the SotA,
while also demonstrating its robustness when processing "in-the-wild" images
without any prior camera knowledge. Our quantitative analysis highlights the
sensitivity of the 2D keypoint estimation accuracy, despite the use of hand
priors. Code is available at https://github.com/cpantazop/HandRepo

### [3] [Adaptive Object Detection with ESRGAN-Enhanced Resolution & Faster R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11122)
*Divya Swetha K,Ziaul Haque Choudhury,Hemanta Kumar Bhuyan,Biswajit Brahma,Nilayam Kumar Kamila*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合ESRGAN和Faster R-CNN的方法，用于从低分辨率图像中改进目标检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低分辨率图像中目标检测性能不佳的问题，提供一种适用于图像质量不一致场景的有效解决方案。

Method: 使用ESRGAN作为预处理步骤增强图像质量，再通过Faster R-CNN进行目标检测。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在低分辨率图像上的检测性能优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在图像质量受限的场景下提供了更鲁棒和可靠的目标检测解决方案。

Abstract: In this study, proposes a method for improved object detection from the
low-resolution images by integrating Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative
Adversarial Networks (ESRGAN) and Faster Region-Convolutional Neural Network
(Faster R-CNN). ESRGAN enhances low-quality images, restoring details and
improving clarity, while Faster R-CNN performs accurate object detection on the
enhanced images. The combination of these techniques ensures better detection
performance, even with poor-quality inputs, offering an effective solution for
applications where image resolution is in consistent. ESRGAN is employed as a
pre-processing step to enhance the low-resolution input image, effectively
restoring lost details and improving overall image quality. Subsequently, the
enhanced image is fed into the Faster R-CNN model for accurate object detection
and localization. Experimental results demonstrate that this integrated
approach yields superior performance compared to traditional methods applied
directly to low-resolution images. The proposed framework provides a promising
solution for applications where image quality is variable or limited, enabling
more robust and reliable object detection in challenging scenarios. It achieves
a balance between improved image quality and efficient object detection

### [4] [Technical Report for Argoverse2 Scenario Mining Challenges on Iterative Error Correction and Spatially-Aware Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11124)
*Yifei Chen,Ross Greer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了RefAV框架的改进方法，通过迭代代码生成和专门提示工程，解决了LLM生成代码的运行时错误和空间关系理解问题，显著提升了场景挖掘的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RefAV框架在利用LLM生成代码时存在运行时错误和空间关系参数理解不准确的问题，影响了场景挖掘的可靠性。

Method: 引入两种改进：(1) 容错迭代代码生成机制，通过错误反馈重新提示LLM；(2) 专门提示工程，提升LLM对空间关系函数的理解和应用。

Result: 在Argoverse 2验证集上测试，使用多种LLM（Qwen2.5-VL-7B、Gemini 2.5 Flash和Gemini 2.5 Pro）均取得性能提升，Gemini 2.5 Pro在官方测试集上HOTA-Temporal得分达52.37。

Conclusion: 改进方法显著提升了场景挖掘的可靠性和精度，验证了技术的有效性。

Abstract: Scenario mining from extensive autonomous driving datasets, such as Argoverse
2, is crucial for the development and validation of self-driving systems. The
RefAV framework represents a promising approach by employing Large Language
Models (LLMs) to translate natural-language queries into executable code for
identifying relevant scenarios. However, this method faces challenges,
including runtime errors stemming from LLM-generated code and inaccuracies in
interpreting parameters for functions that describe complex multi-object
spatial relationships. This technical report introduces two key enhancements to
address these limitations: (1) a fault-tolerant iterative code-generation
mechanism that refines code by re-prompting the LLM with error feedback, and
(2) specialized prompt engineering that improves the LLM's comprehension and
correct application of spatial-relationship functions. Experiments on the
Argoverse 2 validation set with diverse LLMs-Qwen2.5-VL-7B, Gemini 2.5 Flash,
and Gemini 2.5 Pro-show consistent gains across multiple metrics; most notably,
the proposed system achieves a HOTA-Temporal score of 52.37 on the official
test set using Gemini 2.5 Pro. These results underline the efficacy of the
proposed techniques for reliable, high-precision scenario mining.

### [5] [Image-Based Method For Measuring And Classification Of Iron Ore Pellets Using Star-Convex Polygons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11126)
*Artem Solomko,Oleg Kartashev,Andrey Golov,Mikhail Deulin,Vadim Valynkin,Vasily Kharin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于StarDist算法的创新图像测量方法，用于铁矿石球团的分类和质量检测，解决了传统算法在密集和不稳定环境中的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确识别和分析密集且不稳定环境中的物体，尤其是铁矿石球团的质量分类和尺寸测量，是提高最终产品质量的关键。

Method: 利用StarDist算法进行物体分割、轮廓确定、分类和物理尺寸测量，解决了传统方法（如ViT和Mask R-CNN）的局限性。

Result: 开发了一种新方法，能够检测具有平滑边界的物体，显著提高了尺寸测量的准确性和球团大小分布的分析精度。

Conclusion: 通过StarDist算法的应用，为铁矿石球团的复杂分类和测量问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We would like to present a comprehensive study on the classification of iron
ore pellets, aimed at identifying quality violations in the final product,
alongside the development of an innovative imagebased measurement method
utilizing the StarDist algorithm, which is primarily employed in the medical
field. This initiative is motivated by the necessity to accurately identify and
analyze objects within densely packed and unstable environments. The process
involves segmenting these objects, determining their contours, classifying
them, and measuring their physical dimensions. This is crucial because the size
distribution and classification of pellets such as distinguishing between nice
(quality) and joint (caused by the presence of moisture or indicating a process
of production failure) types are among the most significant characteristics
that define the quality of the final product. Traditional algorithms, including
image classification techniques using Vision Transformer (ViT), instance
segmentation methods like Mask R-CNN, and various anomaly segmentation
algorithms, have not yielded satisfactory results in this context.
Consequently, we explored methodologies from related fields to enhance our
approach. The outcome of our research is a novel method designed to detect
objects with smoothed boundaries. This advancement significantly improves the
accuracy of physical dimension measurements and facilitates a more precise
analysis of size distribution among the iron ore pellets. By leveraging the
strengths of the StarDist algorithm, we aim to provide a robust solution that
addresses the challenges posed by the complex nature of pellet classification
and measurement.

### [6] [Segment This Thing: Foveated Tokenization for Efficient Point-Prompted Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11131)
*Tanner Schmidt,Richard Newcombe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STT是一种高效的图像分割模型，通过聚焦输入图像和使用可变分辨率补丁标记化来减少计算成本，同时保持模型大小不变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高图像分割的效率，同时避免减小模型规模，适用于增强现实和机器人应用。

Method: 采用聚焦输入图像的方法，提取以提示点为中心的裁剪区域，并应用可变分辨率补丁标记化，减少图像标记数量。

Result: STT在保持分割性能的同时显著降低了计算成本，能够在消费级硬件上以交互帧率运行。

Conclusion: STT是一种高效且实用的图像分割工具，适用于需要实时性能的应用场景。

Abstract: This paper presents Segment This Thing (STT), a new efficient image
segmentation model designed to produce a single segment given a single point
prompt. Instead of following prior work and increasing efficiency by decreasing
model size, we gain efficiency by foveating input images. Given an image and a
point prompt, we extract a crop centered on the prompt and apply a novel
variable-resolution patch tokenization in which patches are downsampled at a
rate that increases with increased distance from the prompt. This approach
yields far fewer image tokens than uniform patch tokenization. As a result we
can drastically reduce the computational cost of segmentation without reducing
model size. Furthermore, the foveation focuses the model on the region of
interest, a potentially useful inductive bias. We show that our Segment This
Thing model is more efficient than prior work while remaining competitive on
segmentation benchmarks. It can easily run at interactive frame rates on
consumer hardware and is thus a promising tool for augmented reality or
robotics applications.

### [7] [Gender Fairness of Machine Learning Algorithms for Pain Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11132)
*Dylan Green,Yuting Shang,Jiaee Cheong,Yang Liu,Hatice Gunes*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文研究了基于面部表情的自动疼痛检测模型的性别公平性，发现尽管ViT模型准确率最高，但所有模型均存在性别偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗领域中，自动疼痛检测对无法自我报告的患者至关重要，但现有算法在不同人口群体（如性别）中的准确性和公平性研究不足。

Method: 比较了传统ML算法（L SVM、RBF SVM）和DL方法（CNN、ViT），使用UNBC-McMaster数据库评估性能和公平性。

Result: ViT准确率最高，但所有模型均表现出性别偏见，揭示了准确性与公平性之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 需采用公平性感知技术以减少自动医疗系统中的偏见。

Abstract: Automated pain detection through machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL)
algorithms holds significant potential in healthcare, particularly for patients
unable to self-report pain levels. However, the accuracy and fairness of these
algorithms across different demographic groups (e.g., gender) remain
under-researched. This paper investigates the gender fairness of ML and DL
models trained on the UNBC-McMaster Shoulder Pain Expression Archive Database,
evaluating the performance of various models in detecting pain based solely on
the visual modality of participants' facial expressions. We compare traditional
ML algorithms, Linear Support Vector Machine (L SVM) and Radial Basis Function
SVM (RBF SVM), with DL methods, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision
Transformer (ViT), using a range of performance and fairness metrics. While ViT
achieved the highest accuracy and a selection of fairness metrics, all models
exhibited gender-based biases. These findings highlight the persistent
trade-off between accuracy and fairness, emphasising the need for
fairness-aware techniques to mitigate biases in automated healthcare systems.

### [8] [ContextLoss: Context Information for Topology-Preserving Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11134)
*Benedict Schacht,Imke Greving,Simone Frintrop,Berit Zeller-Plumhoff,Christian Wilms*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的损失函数ContextLoss（CLoss），通过考虑拓扑错误的完整上下文，提高了图像分割中拓扑结构的正确性，并在多个数据集上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在图像分割中，保持分割结构的拓扑（如血管、膜或道路）至关重要，拓扑错误可能严重影响导航等功能。现有方法基于关键像素掩码的损失函数，但缺乏对拓扑错误上下文的全面考虑。

Method: 提出ContextLoss（CLoss）损失函数，通过考虑关键像素掩码中拓扑错误的完整上下文，提高网络对拓扑错误的关注。同时提出两种直观指标验证连通性改进。

Result: 在三个公共数据集（2D和3D）及自有的3D纳米成像数据集上验证，CLoss在拓扑感知指标上表现更优，修复了比其他方法多44%的遗漏连接。

Conclusion: CLoss显著提升了拓扑正确性，修复遗漏连接效果显著，代码已公开。

Abstract: In image segmentation, preserving the topology of segmented structures like
vessels, membranes, or roads is crucial. For instance, topological errors on
road networks can significantly impact navigation. Recently proposed solutions
are loss functions based on critical pixel masks that consider the whole
skeleton of the segmented structures in the critical pixel mask. We propose the
novel loss function ContextLoss (CLoss) that improves topological correctness
by considering topological errors with their whole context in the critical
pixel mask. The additional context improves the network focus on the
topological errors. Further, we propose two intuitive metrics to verify
improved connectivity due to a closing of missed connections. We benchmark our
proposed CLoss on three public datasets (2D & 3D) and our own 3D nano-imaging
dataset of bone cement lines. Training with our proposed CLoss increases
performance on topology-aware metrics and repairs up to 44% more missed
connections than other state-of-the-art methods. We make the code publicly
available.

*Paul Couairon,Loick Chambon,Louis Serrano,Jean-Emmanuel Haugeard,Matthieu Cord,Nicolas Thome*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: JAFAR是一种轻量级、灵活的特征上采样器，通过注意力模块提升视觉特征的空间分辨率，适用于多种下游任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础视觉编码器的低分辨率空间特征输出需要上采样以满足高分辨率下游任务的需求。

Method: JAFAR采用基于注意力的模块，结合空间特征变换（SFT）调制，实现低分辨率到任意目标分辨率的上采样。

Result: 实验表明，JAFAR能有效恢复细粒度空间细节，并在多种任务中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: JAFAR在无高分辨率监督的情况下，通过低比例上采样学习，能泛化到更高输出尺度。

Abstract: Foundation Vision Encoders have become essential for a wide range of dense
vision tasks. However, their low-resolution spatial feature outputs necessitate
feature upsampling to produce the high-resolution modalities required for
downstream tasks. In this work, we introduce JAFAR, a lightweight and flexible
feature upsampler that enhances the spatial resolution of visual features from
any Foundation Vision Encoder to an arbitrary target resolution. JAFAR employs
an attention-based module designed to promote semantic alignment between
high-resolution queries, derived from low-level image features, and
semantically enriched low-resolution keys, using Spatial Feature Transform
(SFT) modulation. Notably, despite the absence of high-resolution supervision,
we demonstrate that learning at low upsampling ratios and resolutions
generalizes remarkably well to significantly higher output scales. Extensive
experiments show that JAFAR effectively recovers fine-grained spatial details
and consistently outperforms existing feature upsampling methods across a
diverse set of downstream tasks. Project page at

### [10] [Autonomous Computer Vision Development with Agentic AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11140)
*Jin Kim,Muhammad Wahi-Anwa,Sangyun Park,Shawn Shin,John M. Hoffman,Matthew S. Brown*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文展示了如何利用基于大型语言模型（LLM）的代理AI自主构建计算机视觉系统，通过自然语言提示生成配置并完成任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索代理AI在复杂任务（如医学图像分析）中的自主规划和工具配置能力，减少对数据科学家的依赖。

Method: 扩展开源Cognitive AI环境SimpleMind，结合LLM代理（OpenManus），通过自然语言提示自动生成任务分解和工具配置。

Result: 代理成功生成了YAML格式的配置，并在50张胸部X光片上实现了肺部、心脏和肋骨分割的高准确率（Dice分数分别为0.96、0.82、0.83）。

Conclusion: 代理AI能自主完成传统需人工干预的计算机视觉任务规划和配置，展现了其在实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems leveraging Large Language Models
(LLMs) exhibit significant potential for complex reasoning, planning, and tool
utilization. We demonstrate that a specialized computer vision system can be
built autonomously from a natural language prompt using Agentic AI methods.
This involved extending SimpleMind (SM), an open-source Cognitive AI
environment with configurable tools for medical image analysis, with an
LLM-based agent, implemented using OpenManus, to automate the planning (tool
configuration) for a particular computer vision task. We provide a
proof-of-concept demonstration that an agentic system can interpret a computer
vision task prompt, plan a corresponding SimpleMind workflow by decomposing the
task and configuring appropriate tools. From the user input prompt, "provide sm
(SimpleMind) config for lungs, heart, and ribs segmentation for cxr (chest
x-ray)"), the agent LLM was able to generate the plan (tool configuration file
in YAML format), and execute SM-Learn (training) and SM-Think (inference)
scripts autonomously. The computer vision agent automatically configured,
trained, and tested itself on 50 chest x-ray images, achieving mean dice scores
of 0.96, 0.82, 0.83, for lungs, heart, and ribs, respectively. This work shows
the potential for autonomous planning and tool configuration that has
traditionally been performed by a data scientist in the development of computer
vision applications.

### [11] [FARCLUSS: Fuzzy Adaptive Rebalancing and Contrastive Uncertainty Learning for Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11142)
*Ebenezer Tarubinga,Jenifer Kalafatovich*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种半监督语义分割框架，通过模糊伪标签、不确定性动态加权、自适应类平衡和轻量对比正则化，显著提升了对未标记数据的利用效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决半监督语义分割中伪标签利用不足、类不平衡偏差加剧和预测不确定性忽视的问题。

Method: 采用模糊伪标签、不确定性动态加权、自适应类平衡和轻量对比正则化四种组件。

Result: 在基准测试中表现优于现有方法，显著改进了对少数类和模糊区域的分割。

Conclusion: 该框架通过将不确定性转化为学习资产，有效提升了半监督语义分割的性能。

Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS) faces persistent challenges in
effectively leveraging unlabeled data, such as ineffective utilization of
pseudo-labels, exacerbation of class imbalance biases, and neglect of
prediction uncertainty. Current approaches often discard uncertain regions
through strict thresholding favouring dominant classes. To address these
limitations, we introduce a holistic framework that transforms uncertainty into
a learning asset through four principal components: (1) fuzzy pseudo-labeling,
which preserves soft class distributions from top-K predictions to enrich
supervision; (2) uncertainty-aware dynamic weighting, that modulate pixel-wise
contributions via entropy-based reliability scores; (3) adaptive class
rebalancing, which dynamically adjust losses to counteract long-tailed class
distributions; and (4) lightweight contrastive regularization, that encourage
compact and discriminative feature embeddings. Extensive experiments on
benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving significant improvements in the segmentation of
under-represented classes and ambiguous regions.

Abstract: This paper presents a two-year research project focused on developing
AI-driven measures to analyze classroom dynamics, with particular emphasis on
teacher actions captured through multimodal sensor data. We applied real-time
data from classroom sensors and AI techniques to extract meaningful insights
and support teacher development. Key outcomes include a curated audio-visual
dataset, novel behavioral measures, and a proof-of-concept teaching review
dashboard. An initial evaluation with eight researchers from the National
Institute for Education (NIE) highlighted the system's clarity, usability, and
its non-judgmental, automated analysis approach -- which reduces manual
workloads and encourages constructive reflection. Although the current version
does not assign performance ratings, it provides an objective snapshot of
in-class interactions, helping teachers recognize and improve their
instructional strategies. Designed and tested in an Asian educational context,
this work also contributes a culturally grounded methodology to the growing
field of AI-based educational analytics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AlignHuman框架通过结合偏好优化和分治训练策略，优化了人类视频生成中运动自然性和视觉保真度的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人类动画生成中运动自然性与视觉保真度的矛盾问题。

Method: 提出时间步分段偏好优化（TPO）和两个专用LoRA模块，分别优化不同时间步区间的目标。

Result: 实验表明AlignHuman显著提升基线性能，减少推理步数（100到30步），速度提升3.3倍且质量影响小。

Conclusion: AlignHuman通过分治策略和偏好优化，有效平衡了运动自然性和视觉保真度，提升了生成效率。

Abstract: Recent advancements in human video generation and animation tasks, driven by
diffusion models, have achieved significant progress. However, expressive and
realistic human animation remains challenging due to the trade-off between
motion naturalness and visual fidelity. To address this, we propose
\textbf{AlignHuman}, a framework that combines Preference Optimization as a
post-training technique with a divide-and-conquer training strategy to jointly
optimize these competing objectives. Our key insight stems from an analysis of
the denoising process across timesteps: (1) early denoising timesteps primarily
control motion dynamics, while (2) fidelity and human structure can be
effectively managed by later timesteps, even if early steps are skipped.
Building on this observation, we propose timestep-segment preference
optimization (TPO) and introduce two specialized LoRAs as expert alignment
modules, each targeting a specific dimension in its corresponding timestep
interval. The LoRAs are trained using their respective preference data and
activated in the corresponding intervals during inference to enhance motion
naturalness and fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AlignHuman
improves strong baselines and reduces NFEs during inference, achieving a
3.3$\times$ speedup (from 100 NFEs to 30 NFEs) with minimal impact on
generation quality. Homepage:

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) holds significant potential for
clinical decision support, yet existing efforts primarily focus on 2D imaging
with limited task diversity. This paper presents 3D-RAD, a large-scale dataset
designed to advance 3D Med-VQA using radiology CT scans. The 3D-RAD dataset
encompasses six diverse VQA tasks: anomaly detection, image observation,
medical computation, existence detection, static temporal diagnosis, and
longitudinal temporal diagnosis. It supports both open- and closed-ended
questions while introducing complex reasoning challenges, including
computational tasks and multi-stage temporal analysis, to enable comprehensive
benchmarking. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that existing vision-language
models (VLMs), especially medical VLMs exhibit limited generalization,
particularly in multi-temporal tasks, underscoring the challenges of real-world
3D diagnostic reasoning. To drive future advancements, we release a
high-quality training set 3D-RAD-T of 136,195 expert-aligned samples, showing
that fine-tuning on this dataset could significantly enhance model performance.

Abstract: The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and large
language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the landscape of digital content
creation in different modalities. However, its potential use in Physical AI for
engineering design, where the production of physically viable artifacts is
paramount, remains vastly underexplored. The absence of physical knowledge in
existing LLM-to-3D models often results in outputs detached from real-world
physical constraints. To address this gap, we introduce LLM-to-Phy3D, a
physically conform online 3D object generation that enables existing LLM-to-3D
models to produce physically conforming 3D objects on the fly. LLM-to-Phy3D
introduces a novel online black-box refinement loop that empowers large
language models (LLMs) through synergistic visual and physics-based
evaluations. By delivering directional feedback in an iterative refinement
process, LLM-to-Phy3D actively drives the discovery of prompts that yield 3D
artifacts with enhanced physical performance and greater geometric novelty
relative to reference objects, marking a substantial contribution to AI-driven
generative design. Systematic evaluations of LLM-to-Phy3D, supported by
ablation studies in vehicle design optimization, reveal various LLM
improvements gained by 4.5% to 106.7% in producing physically conform target
domain 3D designs over conventional LLM-to-3D models. The encouraging results
suggest the potential general use of LLM-to-Phy3D in Physical AI for scientific
and engineering applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CURSOR的算法，首次通过自校准方法从无标签的EEG和图像数据中恢复未知的心理目标（如人脸图像）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是解决在无标签数据的情况下，如何从EEG和图像数据中恢复心理目标的问题，此前的研究依赖于有标签数据或预训练解码器。

Method: 方法包括提出CURSOR框架和算法，通过自校准学习从无标签数据中恢复心理目标，无需预训练解码器。

Result: 实验结果表明，CURSOR能预测与人类感知判断相关的图像相似度分数，并利用这些分数对未知心理目标进行刺激排序，还能生成与目标难以区分的新刺激。

Conclusion: 结论是CURSOR首次实现了在无标签数据下恢复心理目标，为脑机接口和神经科学提供了新工具。

Abstract: We consider the problem of recovering a mental target (e.g., an image of a
face) that a participant has in mind from paired EEG (i.e., brain responses)
and image (i.e., perceived faces) data collected during interactive sessions
without access to labeled information. The problem has been previously explored
with labeled data but not via self-calibration, where labeled data is
unavailable. Here, we present the first framework and an algorithm, CURSOR,
that learns to recover unknown mental targets without access to labeled data or
pre-trained decoders. Our experiments on naturalistic images of faces
demonstrate that CURSOR can (1) predict image similarity scores that correlate
with human perceptual judgments without any label information, (2) use these
scores to rank stimuli against an unknown mental target, and (3) generate new
stimuli indistinguishable from the unknown mental target (validated via a user
study, N=53).

TL;DR: AutoCaption是一个利用蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）自动生成多样化视频描述句子的框架，用于构建细粒度视频字幕基准MCTS-VCB，全面评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的视频理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频字幕评测基准存在关键点不足、数据创建成本高和评估范围有限的问题，需要一种自动化的解决方案。

Method: 提出AutoCaption框架，利用MCTS迭代生成多样化的视频描述句子，构建MCTS-VCB基准。

Result: 在MCTS-VCB上评估了20多个MLLMs，Gemini-1.5-Pro表现最佳（F1=71.2）。通过AutoCaption生成的数据微调InternVL2.5-8B，性能显著提升。

Conclusion: AutoCaption能有效生成多样化视频描述，提升MLLMs的视频理解能力，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Video captioning can be used to assess the video understanding capabilities
of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, existing benchmarks and
evaluation protocols suffer from crucial issues, such as inadequate or
homogeneous creation of key points, exorbitant cost of data creation, and
limited evaluation scopes. To address these issues, we propose an automatic
framework, named AutoCaption, which leverages Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to
construct numerous and diverse descriptive sentences (\textit{i.e.}, key
points) that thoroughly represent video content in an iterative way. This
iterative captioning strategy enables the continuous enhancement of video
details such as actions, objects' attributes, environment details, etc. We
apply AutoCaption to curate MCTS-VCB, a fine-grained video caption benchmark
covering video details, thereby enabling a comprehensive evaluation of MLLMs on
the video captioning task. We evaluate more than 20 open- and closed-source
MLLMs of varying sizes on MCTS-VCB. Results show that MCTS-VCB can effectively
and comprehensively evaluate the video captioning capability, with
Gemini-1.5-Pro achieving the highest F1 score of 71.2. Interestingly, we
fine-tune InternVL2.5-8B with the AutoCaption-generated data, which helps the
model achieve an overall improvement of 25.0% on MCTS-VCB and 16.3% on
DREAM-1K, further demonstrating the effectiveness of AutoCaption. The code and
data are available at https://github.com/tjunlp-lab/MCTS-VCB.

Abstract: Retrieving accurate details from documents is a crucial task, especially when
handling a combination of scanned images and native digital formats. This
document presents a combined framework for text extraction that merges Optical
Character Recognition (OCR) techniques with Large Language Models (LLMs) to
deliver structured outputs enriched by contextual understanding and confidence
indicators. Scanned files are processed using OCR engines, while digital files
are interpreted through layout-aware libraries. The extracted raw text is
subsequently analyzed by an LLM to identify key-value pairs and resolve
ambiguities. A comparative analysis of different OCR tools is presented to
evaluate their effectiveness concerning accuracy, layout recognition, and
processing speed. The approach demonstrates significant improvements over
traditional rule-based and template-based methods, offering enhanced
flexibility and semantic precision across different document categories

Result: 发现VLMs在视觉社会-语用推理方面存在显著缺陷。

Conclusion: VLMs在社交推理中仍有改进空间，需进一步研究以弥补其缺陷。

Abstract: Understanding human social behavior such as recognizing emotions and the
social dynamics causing them is an important and challenging problem. While
LLMs have made remarkable advances, they are limited to the textual domain and
cannot account for the major role that non-verbal cues play in understanding
social situations. Vision Language Models (VLMs) can potentially account for
this gap, however their ability to make correct inferences over such social
cues has received little attention. In this paper, we explore the capabilities
of VLMs at social reasoning. We identify a previously overlooked limitation in
VLMs: the Visual Social-Pragmatic Inference gap. To target this gap, we propose
a new task for VLMs: Visual Social-Pragmatic Inference. We construct a high
quality dataset to test the abilities of a VLM for this task and benchmark the
performance of several VLMs on it.

Abstract: Visualizing the first few kilometers of the Earth's subsurface, a
long-standing challenge gating a virtually inexhaustible list of important
applications, is coming within reach through deep learning. Building on
techniques of generative artificial intelligence applied to voxelated images,
we demonstrate a method that extends surface geological data supplemented by
boreholes to a three-dimensional subsurface region by training a neural
network. The Earth's land area having been extensively mapped for geological
features, the bottleneck of this or any related technique is the availability
of data below the surface. We close this data gap in the development of
subsurface deep learning by designing a synthetic data-generator process that
mimics eons of geological activity such as sediment compaction, volcanic
intrusion, and tectonic dynamics to produce a virtually limitless number of
samples of the near lithosphere. A foundation model trained on such synthetic
data is able to generate a 3D image of the subsurface from a previously unseen
map of surface topography and geology, showing increasing fidelity with
increasing access to borehole data, depicting such structures as layers,
faults, folds, dikes, and sills. We illustrate the early promise of the
combination of a synthetic lithospheric generator with a trained neural network
model using generative flow matching. Ultimately, such models will be
fine-tuned on data from applicable campaigns, such as mineral prospecting in a
given region. Though useful in itself, a regionally fine-tuned models may be
employed not as an end but as a means: as an AI-based regularizer in a more
traditional inverse problem application, in which the objective function
represents the mismatch of additional data with physical models with
applications in resource exploration, hazard assessment, and geotechnical
engineering.

Abstract: This paper compares the performance of BiLSTM and CNN+GRU deep learning
models for Human Activity Recognition (HAR) on two WiFi-based Channel State
Information (CSI) datasets: UT-HAR and NTU-Fi HAR. The findings indicate that
the CNN+GRU model has a higher accuracy on the UT-HAR dataset (95.20%) thanks
to its ability to extract spatial features. In contrast, the BiLSTM model
performs better on the high-resolution NTU-Fi HAR dataset (92.05%) by
extracting long-term temporal dependencies more effectively. The findings
strongly emphasize the critical role of dataset characteristics and
preprocessing techniques in model performance improvement. We also show the

Motivation: 临床决策对患者结果至关重要，LLMs在医学影像中的视觉问答应用尚未充分探索，且监督微调因数据有限和标注成本高而不切实际。

Method: 结合视觉语言模型和LLM，通过测试时缩放整合多候选输出生成可靠诊断。

Result: 在多种医学影像模态中验证，测试时缩放策略提升了诊断准确性，且无偏提示提高了LLM生成诊断的可靠性。

Conclusion: 提出的零样本框架有效增强了LLMs在医学影像诊断中的推理能力，为临床决策提供了可靠支持。

Abstract: As a cornerstone of patient care, clinical decision-making significantly
influences patient outcomes and can be enhanced by large language models
(LLMs). Although LLMs have demonstrated remarkable performance, their
application to visual question answering in medical imaging, particularly for
reasoning-based diagnosis, remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, supervised
fine-tuning for reasoning tasks is largely impractical due to limited data
availability and high annotation costs. In this work, we introduce a zero-shot
framework for reliable medical image diagnosis that enhances the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs in clinical settings through test-time scaling. Given a
medical image and a textual prompt, a vision-language model processes a medical
image along with a corresponding textual prompt to generate multiple
descriptions or interpretations of visual features. These interpretations are
then fed to an LLM, where a test-time scaling strategy consolidates multiple
candidate outputs into a reliable final diagnosis. We evaluate our approach
across various medical imaging modalities -- including radiology,
ophthalmology, and histopathology -- and demonstrate that the proposed
test-time scaling strategy enhances diagnostic accuracy for both our and
baseline methods. Additionally, we provide an empirical analysis showing that
the proposed approach, which allows unbiased prompting in the first stage,
improves the reliability of LLM-generated diagnoses and enhances classification
accuracy.

Method: 结合EnMAP卫星的高光谱影像和GEDI激光雷达的AGB密度估计，构建了一个覆盖七大洲的基准数据集，并评估了Geo-FMs与基线U-Net的性能。

Result: Geo-FMs在部分情况下表现优于U-Net，性能差异与数据集大小和Vision Transformer的token patch大小相关。

Conclusion: 该数据集有助于Geo-FMs的开发与评估，并支持地理偏差和泛化能力的研究。

Abstract: Comprehensive evaluation of geospatial foundation models (Geo-FMs) requires
benchmarking across diverse tasks, sensors, and geographic regions. However,
most existing benchmark datasets are limited to segmentation or classification
tasks, and focus on specific geographic areas. To address this gap, we
introduce a globally distributed dataset for forest aboveground biomass (AGB)
estimation, a pixel-wise regression task. This benchmark dataset combines
co-located hyperspectral imagery (HSI) from the Environmental Mapping and
Analysis Program (EnMAP) satellite and predictions of AGB density estimates
derived from the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation lidars, covering seven
continental regions. Our experimental results on this dataset demonstrate that
the evaluated Geo-FMs can match or, in some cases, surpass the performance of a
baseline U-Net, especially when fine-tuning the encoder. We also find that the
performance difference between the U-Net and Geo-FMs depends on the dataset
size for each region and highlight the importance of the token patch size in
the Vision Transformer backbone for accurate predictions in pixel-wise
regression tasks. By releasing this globally distributed hyperspectral
benchmark dataset, we aim to facilitate the development and evaluation of
Geo-FMs for HSI applications. Leveraging this dataset additionally enables
research into geographic bias and generalization capacity of Geo-FMs. The
dataset and source code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is essential for studying brain
function and diagnosing neurological disorders, but current analysis methods
face reproducibility and transferability issues due to complex pre-processing
and task-specific models. We introduce NeuroSTORM (Neuroimaging Foundation
Model with Spatial-Temporal Optimized Representation Modeling), a generalizable
framework that directly learns from 4D fMRI volumes and enables efficient
knowledge transfer across diverse applications. NeuroSTORM is pre-trained on
28.65 million fMRI frames (>9,000 hours) from over 50,000 subjects across
multiple centers and ages 5 to 100. Using a Mamba backbone and a shifted
scanning strategy, it efficiently processes full 4D volumes. We also propose a
spatial-temporal optimized pre-training approach and task-specific prompt
tuning to improve transferability. NeuroSTORM outperforms existing methods
across five tasks: age/gender prediction, phenotype prediction, disease
diagnosis, fMRI-to-image retrieval, and task-based fMRI classification. It
demonstrates strong clinical utility on datasets from hospitals in the U.S.,
South Korea, and Australia, achieving top performance in disease diagnosis and
cognitive phenotype prediction. NeuroSTORM provides a standardized, open-source
foundation model to improve reproducibility and transferability in fMRI-based
clinical research.

Motivation: 视频质量评估（VQA）中，时空动态和预训练模型限制了自由能自修复机制的应用，亟需解决这些挑战。

Method: 提出双分支架构（美学分支和技术分支），结合自由能自修复模块和生物启发预测头，模拟自适应修复行为。

Result: 在五个公开VQA基准测试中表现优异，性能和可解释性优于现有方法。

Conclusion: EyeSimVQA通过自由能自修复和生物启发设计，为VQA提供了高效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Free-energy-guided self-repair mechanisms have shown promising results in
image quality assessment (IQA), but remain under-explored in video quality
assessment (VQA), where temporal dynamics and model constraints pose unique
challenges. Unlike static images, video content exhibits richer spatiotemporal
complexity, making perceptual restoration more difficult. Moreover, VQA systems
often rely on pre-trained backbones, which limits the direct integration of
enhancement modules without affecting model stability. To address these issues,
we propose EyeSimVQA, a novel VQA framework that incorporates free-energy-based
self-repair. It adopts a dual-branch architecture, with an aesthetic branch for
global perceptual evaluation and a technical branch for fine-grained structural
and semantic analysis. Each branch integrates specialized enhancement modules
tailored to distinct visual inputs-resized full-frame images and patch-based
fragments-to simulate adaptive repair behaviors. We also explore a principled
strategy for incorporating high-level visual features without disrupting the
original backbone. In addition, we design a biologically inspired prediction
head that models sweeping gaze dynamics to better fuse global and local
representations for quality prediction. Experiments on five public VQA
benchmarks demonstrate that EyeSimVQA achieves competitive or superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, while offering improved
interpretability through its biologically grounded design.

Conclusion: WaveFormer在sEMG手势识别中高效且轻量，适合资源受限的嵌入式系统部署。

Abstract: Human-machine interaction, particularly in prosthetic and robotic control,
has seen progress with gesture recognition via surface electromyographic (sEMG)
signals.However, classifying similar gestures that produce nearly identical
muscle signals remains a challenge, often reducing classification accuracy.
Traditional deep learning models for sEMG gesture recognition are large and
computationally expensive, limiting their deployment on resource-constrained
embedded systems. In this work, we propose WaveFormer, a lightweight
transformer-based architecture tailored for sEMG gesture recognition. Our model
integrates time-domain and frequency-domain features through a novel learnable
wavelet transform, enhancing feature extraction. In particular, the WaveletConv
module, a multi-level wavelet decomposition layer with depthwise separable
convolution, ensures both efficiency and compactness. With just 3.1 million
parameters, WaveFormer achieves 95% classification accuracy on the EPN612
dataset, outperforming larger models. Furthermore, when profiled on a laptop
equipped with an Intel CPU, INT8 quantization achieves real-time deployment
with a 6.75 ms inference latency.

Result: 实验表明SF-TMAT在恶劣场景下具有优越性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: SF-TMAT为无人机恶劣场景目标检测提供了首个基准，并显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) has shown promise in effectively
alleviating the performance degradation caused by domain gaps between source
and target domains, and it can potentially be generalized to UAV object
detection in adverse scenes. However, existing UDA studies are based on natural
images or clear UAV imagery, and research focused on UAV imagery in adverse
conditions is still in its infancy. Moreover, due to the unique perspective of
UAVs and the interference from adverse conditions, these methods often fail to
accurately align features and are influenced by limited or noisy pseudo-labels.
To address this, we propose the first benchmark for UAV object detection in
adverse scenes, the Statistical Feedback-Driven Threshold and Mask Adjustment
Teacher-Student Framework (SF-TMAT). Specifically, SF-TMAT introduces a design
called Dynamic Step Feedback Mask Adjustment Autoencoder (DSFMA), which
dynamically adjusts the mask ratio and reconstructs feature maps by integrating
training progress and loss feedback. This approach dynamically adjusts the
learning focus at different training stages to meet the model's needs for
learning features at varying levels of granularity. Additionally, we propose a
unique Variance Feedback Smoothing Threshold (VFST) strategy, which
statistically computes the mean confidence of each class and dynamically
adjusts the selection threshold by incorporating a variance penalty term. This
strategy improves the quality of pseudo-labels and uncovers potentially valid
labels, thus mitigating domain bias. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority and generalization capability of the proposed SF-TMAT in UAV object
detection under adverse scene conditions. The Code is released at

Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge in research focused on leveraging graph
learning techniques to detect neurodegenerative diseases. However, existing
graph-based approaches typically lack the ability to localize and extract the
specific brain regions driving neurodegenerative pathology within the full
connectome. Additionally, recent works on multimodal brain graph models often
suffer from high computational complexity, limiting their practical use in
resource-constrained devices. In this study, we present BrainMAP, a novel
multimodal graph learning framework designed for precise and computationally
efficient identification of brain regions affected by neurodegenerative
diseases. First, BrainMAP utilizes an atlas-driven filtering approach guided by
the AAL atlas to pinpoint and extract critical brain subgraphs. Unlike recent
state-of-the-art methods, which model the entire brain network, BrainMAP
achieves more than 50% reduction in computational overhead by concentrating on
disease-relevant subgraphs. Second, we employ an advanced multimodal fusion

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffFuSR是一个模块化管道，用于将Sentinel-2 Level-2A影像的12个光谱波段超分辨率统一到2.5米的地面采样距离（GSD）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Sentinel-2影像多光谱波段分辨率不一致的问题，提升遥感影像的质量和应用价值。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：1）基于扩散模型的超分辨率（SR）模型训练高分辨率RGB影像；2）学习融合网络利用超分辨率RGB影像作为空间先验，提升多光谱波段分辨率。

Result: 在OpenSR基准测试中表现优于现有方法，反射率保真度、光谱一致性、空间对齐和幻觉抑制方面均有提升。

Conclusion: 通过生成先验和融合策略，DiffFuSR为Sentinel-2超分辨率提供了一个模块化框架，显著提升了影像质量。

Abstract: This paper presents DiffFuSR, a modular pipeline for super-resolving all 12
spectral bands of Sentinel-2 Level-2A imagery to a unified ground sampling
distance (GSD) of 2.5 meters. The pipeline comprises two stages: (i) a
diffusion-based super-resolution (SR) model trained on high-resolution RGB
imagery from the NAIP and WorldStrat datasets, harmonized to simulate
Sentinel-2 characteristics; and (ii) a learned fusion network that upscales the
remaining multispectral bands using the super-resolved RGB image as a spatial
prior. We introduce a robust degradation model and contrastive degradation
encoder to support blind SR. Extensive evaluations of the proposed SR pipeline
on the OpenSR benchmark demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
current SOTA baselines in terms of reflectance fidelity, spectral consistency,
spatial alignment, and hallucination suppression. Furthermore, the fusion
network significantly outperforms classical pansharpening approaches, enabling
accurate enhancement of Sentinel-2's 20 m and 60 m bands. This study
underscores the power of harmonized learning with generative priors and fusion
strategies to create a modular framework for Sentinel-2 SR. Our code and models

*Amirali Ataee Naeini,Ashkan Teymouri,Ghazaleh Jafarsalehi,Michael Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于YOLOv11的改进模型，用于提高车辆速度和车道检测的准确性，特别适用于加州交通监控。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 加州车辆数量增加，交通系统不足，需要更有效的车辆速度检测方法，尤其是区分不同车道和车辆类型。

Method: 使用YOLOv11模型，训练了800张鸟瞰图，优化了车辆速度和车道检测，并评估了无人机高度、ROI距离和车速对检测的影响。

Result: 改进的YOLOv11模型在速度和分类检测中表现优异，MAE为0.97 mph，MSE为0.94 mph²。

Conclusion: 该模型有效解决了车辆速度和车道检测的挑战，适用于交通监控和法规执行。

Abstract: The increase in vehicle numbers in California, driven by inadequate
transportation systems and sparse speed cameras, necessitates effective vehicle
speed detection. Detecting vehicle speeds per lane is critical for monitoring
High-Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lane speeds, distinguishing between cars and heavy
vehicles with differing speed limits, and enforcing lane restrictions for heavy
vehicles. While prior works utilized YOLO (You Only Look Once) for vehicle
speed detection, they often lacked accuracy, failed to identify vehicle lanes,
and offered limited or less practical classification categories. This study
introduces a fine-tuned YOLOv11 model, trained on almost 800 bird's-eye view
images, to enhance vehicle speed detection accuracy which is much higher
compare to the previous works. The proposed system identifies the lane for each
vehicle and classifies vehicles into two categories: cars and heavy vehicles.
Designed to meet the specific requirements of traffic monitoring and
regulation, the model also evaluates the effects of factors such as drone
height, distance of Region of Interest (ROI), and vehicle speed on detection
accuracy and speed measurement. Drone footage collected from Northern
California was used to assess the proposed system. The fine-tuned YOLOv11
achieved its best performance with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.97 mph and
mean squared error (MSE) of 0.94 $\text{mph}^2$, demonstrating its efficacy in
addressing challenges in vehicle speed detection and classification.

Abstract: In recent years, the development of interconnected devices has expanded in
many fields, from infotainment to education and industrial applications. This
trend has been accelerated by the increased number of sensors and accessibility
to powerful hardware and software. One area that significantly benefits from
these advancements is Teleoperated Driving (TD). In this scenario, a controller
drives safely a vehicle from remote leveraging sensors data generated onboard
the vehicle, and exchanged via Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications. In
this work, we tackle the problem of detecting the presence of cars and
pedestrians from point cloud data to enable safe TD operations. More
specifically, we exploit the SELMA dataset, a multimodal, open-source,
synthetic dataset for autonomous driving, that we expanded by including the
ground-truth bounding boxes of 3D objects to support object detection. We
analyze the performance of state-of-the-art compression algorithms and object
detectors under several metrics, including compression efficiency,
(de)compression and inference time, and detection accuracy. Moreover, we
measure the impact of compression and detection on the V2X network in terms of
data rate and latency with respect to 3GPP requirements for TD applications.

Result: 知识追踪遗忘更适用于基础模型，且更贴近人类认知机制。

Conclusion: 知识追踪机器遗忘是一种更实用且符合认知科学的遗忘方法。

Abstract: Machine unlearning removes certain training data points and their influence
on AI models (e.g., when a data owner revokes their decision to allow models to
learn from the data). In this position paper, we propose to lift data-tracing
machine unlearning to knowledge-tracing for foundation models (FMs). We support
this position based on practical needs and insights from cognitive studies.
Practically, tracing data cannot meet the diverse unlearning requests for FMs,
which may be from regulators, enterprise users, product teams, etc., having no
access to FMs' massive training data. Instead, it is convenient for these
parties to issue an unlearning request about the knowledge or capability FMs
(should not) possess. Cognitively, knowledge-tracing unlearning aligns with how
the human brain forgets more closely than tracing individual training data
points. Finally, we provide a concrete case study about a vision-language FM to
illustrate how an unlearner might instantiate the knowledge-tracing machine
unlearning paradigm.

Abstract: World models aim to simulate environments and enable effective agent
behavior. However, modeling real-world environments presents unique challenges
as they dynamically change across both space and, crucially, time. To capture
these composed dynamics, we introduce a Spatio-Temporal Road Image Dataset for
Exploration (STRIDE) permuting 360-degree panoramic imagery into rich
interconnected observation, state and action nodes. Leveraging this structure,
we can simultaneously model the relationship between egocentric views,
positional coordinates, and movement commands across both space and time. We
benchmark this dataset via TARDIS, a transformer-based generative world model
that integrates spatial and temporal dynamics through a unified autoregressive
framework trained on STRIDE. We demonstrate robust performance across a range
of agentic tasks such as controllable photorealistic image synthesis,
instruction following, autonomous self-control, and state-of-the-art
georeferencing. These results suggest a promising direction towards
sophisticated generalist agents--capable of understanding and manipulating the
spatial and temporal aspects of their material environments--with enhanced
embodied reasoning capabilities. Training code, datasets, and model checkpoints

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have transformed computer-assisted
intervention and surgical video analysis, driving improvements not only in
surgical training, intraoperative decision support, and patient outcomes, but
also in postoperative documentation and surgical discovery. Central to these
developments is the availability of large, high-quality annotated datasets. In
gynecologic laparoscopy, surgical scene understanding and action recognition
are fundamental for building intelligent systems that assist surgeons during
operations and provide deeper analysis after surgery. However, existing
datasets are often limited by small scale, narrow task focus, or insufficiently
detailed annotations, limiting their utility for comprehensive, end-to-end
workflow analysis. To address these limitations, we introduce GynSurg, the
largest and most diverse multi-task dataset for gynecologic laparoscopic
surgery to date. GynSurg provides rich annotations across multiple tasks,
supporting applications in action recognition, semantic segmentation, surgical
documentation, and discovery of novel procedural insights. We demonstrate the
dataset quality and versatility by benchmarking state-of-the-art models under a
standardized training protocol. To accelerate progress in the field, we
publicly release the GynSurg dataset and its annotations

Motivation: 图像生成模型的快速发展带来了潜在的滥用风险（如深度伪造、钓鱼攻击等），需要有效的真实性验证机制。传统水印方法因重标记不匹配问题难以直接应用于图像生成模型。

Method: 提出C-reweight方法，通过基于聚类的策略等效处理同一聚类内的标记，解决重标记不匹配问题。

Result: 实验表明，C-reweight在保持图像质量的同时，显著提升了水印的可检测性，优于现有无失真水印技术。

Conclusion: C-reweight为安全可靠的图像合成设定了新标准。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of image generation models has revolutionized visual
content creation, enabling the synthesis of highly realistic and contextually
accurate images for diverse applications. However, the potential for misuse,
such as deepfake generation, image based phishing attacks, and fabrication of
misleading visual evidence, underscores the need for robust authenticity
verification mechanisms. While traditional statistical watermarking techniques
have proven effective for autoregressive language models, their direct
adaptation to image generation models encounters significant challenges due to
a phenomenon we term retokenization mismatch, a disparity between original and
retokenized sequences during the image generation process. To overcome this
limitation, we propose C-reweight, a novel, distortion-free watermarking method
explicitly designed for image generation models. By leveraging a
clustering-based strategy that treats tokens within the same cluster
equivalently, C-reweight mitigates retokenization mismatch while preserving
image fidelity. Extensive evaluations on leading image generation platforms
reveal that C-reweight not only maintains the visual quality of generated
images but also improves detectability over existing distortion-free
watermarking techniques, setting a new standard for secure and trustworthy
image synthesis.

Conclusion: 该方法通过联合优化局部和非局部结构约束，实现了高效且可扩展的高光谱图像聚类。

Abstract: Subspace clustering has become widely adopted for the unsupervised analysis
of hyperspectral images (HSIs). Recent model-aware deep subspace clustering
methods often use a two-stage framework, involving the calculation of a
self-representation matrix with complexity of O(n^2), followed by spectral
clustering. However, these methods are computationally intensive, generally
incorporating solely either local or non-local spatial structure constraints,
and their structural constraints fall short of effectively supervising the
entire clustering process.
  We propose a scalable, context-preserving deep clustering method based on
basis representation, which jointly captures local and non-local structures for
efficient HSI clustering. To preserve local structure (i.e., spatial continuity
within subspaces), we introduce a spatial smoothness constraint that aligns
clustering predictions with their spatially filtered versions. For non-local
structure (i.e., spectral continuity), we employ a mini-cluster-based scheme
that refines predictions at the group level, encouraging spectrally similar
pixels to belong to the same subspace. Notably, these two constraints are
jointly optimized to reinforce each other.
  Specifically, our model is designed as an one-stage approach in which the
structural constraints are applied to the entire clustering process. The time
and space complexity of our method is O(n), making it applicable to large-scale
HSI data. Experiments on real-world datasets show that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art techniques. Our code is available at:

Abstract: People get informed of a daily task plan through diverse media involving both
texts and images. However, most prior research only focuses on LLM's capability
of textual plan generation. The potential of large-scale models in providing
text-image plans remains understudied. Generating high-quality text-image plans
faces two main challenges: ensuring consistent alignment between two modalities
and keeping coherence among visual steps. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel framework that generates and refines text-image plans
step-by-step. At each iteration, our framework (1) drafts the next textual step
based on the prediction history; (2) edits the last visual step to obtain the
next one; (3) extracts PDDL-like visual information; and (4) refines the draft
with the extracted visual information. The textual and visual step produced in
stage (4) and (2) will then serve as inputs for the next iteration. Our
approach offers a plug-and-play improvement to various backbone models, such as
Mistral-7B, Gemini-1.5, and GPT-4o. To evaluate the effectiveness of our
approach, we collect a new benchmark consisting of 1,100 tasks and their
text-image pair solutions covering 11 daily topics. We also design and validate
a new set of metrics to evaluate the multimodal consistency and coherence in
text-image plans. Extensive experiment results show the effectiveness of our
approach on a range of backbone models against competitive baselines. Our code

Conclusion: 动态双向空间塔显著提升了模型对空间关系的理解和推理能力，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: The Visual Question Answering (VQA) task requires the simultaneous
understanding of image content and question semantics. However, existing
methods often have difficulty handling complex reasoning scenarios due to
insufficient cross-modal interaction and capturing the entity spatial
relationships in the
image.\cite{huang2023adaptive}\cite{liu2021comparing}\cite{guibas2021adaptive}\cite{zhang2022vsa}We
studied a brand-new approach to replace the attention mechanism in order to
enhance the reasoning ability of the model and its understanding of spatial
relationships.Specifically, we propose a dynamic bidirectional spatial tower,
which is divided into four layers to observe the image according to the
principle of human gestalt vision. This naturally provides a powerful
structural prior for the spatial organization between entities, enabling the
model to no longer blindly search for relationships between pixels but make
judgments based on more meaningful perceptual units. Change from "seeing
images" to "perceiving and organizing image content".A large number of
experiments have shown that our module can be used in any other multimodal
model and achieve advanced results, demonstrating its potential in spatial
relationship processing.Meanwhile, the multimodal visual question-answering
model July trained by our method has achieved state-of-the-art results with
only 3B parameters, especially on the question-answering dataset of spatial
relations.

Result: 实验表明，\mymethod有效减少了幻觉问题，提升了MLLMs的可靠性和性能。

Conclusion: 通过专注于相关信息的纠正，\mymethod在不降低整体性能的情况下显著减少了幻觉问题。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) frequently suffer from hallucination
issues, generating information about objects that are not present in input
images during vision-language tasks. These hallucinations particularly
undermine model reliability in practical applications requiring accurate object
identification. To address this challenge, we propose \mymethod,\ a preference
learning approach that mitigates hallucinations by focusing on targeted areas
where they occur. To implement this, we build a dataset containing hallucinated
responses, correct responses, and target information (i.e., objects present in
the images and the corresponding chunk positions in responses affected by
hallucinations). By applying a preference learning method restricted to these
specific targets, the model can filter out irrelevant signals and focus on
correcting hallucinations. This allows the model to produce more factual
responses by concentrating solely on relevant information. Experimental results
demonstrate that \mymethod\ effectively reduces hallucinations across multiple
vision hallucination tasks, improving the reliability and performance of MLLMs
without diminishing overall performance.

Conclusion: Auto-Connect通过综合方法解决了骨骼绑定中的连通性和变形问题，效果优于现有方法。

Abstract: We introduce Auto-Connect, a novel approach for automatic rigging that
explicitly preserves skeletal connectivity through a connectivity-preserving
tokenization scheme. Unlike previous methods that predict bone positions
represented as two joints or first predict points before determining
connectivity, our method employs special tokens to define endpoints for each
joint's children and for each hierarchical layer, effectively automating
connectivity relationships. This approach significantly enhances topological
accuracy by integrating connectivity information directly into the prediction
framework. To further guarantee high-quality topology, we implement a
topology-aware reward function that quantifies topological correctness, which
is then utilized in a post-training phase through reward-guided Direct
Preference Optimization. Additionally, we incorporate implicit geodesic
features for latent top-k bone selection, which substantially improves skinning
quality. By leveraging geodesic distance information within the model's latent
space, our approach intelligently determines the most influential bones for
each vertex, effectively mitigating common skinning artifacts. This combination
of connectivity-preserving tokenization, reward-guided fine-tuning, and
geodesic-aware bone selection enables our model to consistently generate more
anatomically plausible skeletal structures with superior deformation
properties.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion model since its propose has significantly influenced
the content creation due to its impressive generation capability. However, this
capability depends on large-scale text-image datasets gathered from web
platforms like social media, posing substantial challenges in copyright
compliance and personal privacy leakage. Though there are some efforts devoted
to explore approaches for auditing data provenance in text-to-image diffusion
models, existing work has unrealistic assumptions that can obtain model
internal knowledge, e.g., intermediate results, or the evaluation is not
reliable. To fill this gap, we propose a completely black-box auditing
framework called Feature Semantic Consistency-based Auditing (FSCA). It
utilizes two types of semantic connections within the text-to-image diffusion
model for auditing, eliminating the need for access to internal knowledge. To
demonstrate the effectiveness of our FSCA framework, we perform extensive
experiments on LAION-mi dataset and COCO dataset, and compare with eight
state-of-the-art baseline approaches. The results show that FSCA surpasses
previous baseline approaches across various metrics and different data
distributions, showcasing the superiority of our FSCA. Moreover, we introduce a
recall balance strategy and a threshold adjustment strategy, which collectively
allows FSCA to reach up a user-level accuracy of 90% in a real-world auditing
scenario with only 10 samples/user, highlighting its strong auditing potential
in real-world applications. Our code is made available at

Abstract: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) faces a fundamental challenge of effectively
aligning audio and visual modalities. While recent approaches leverage
foundation models to address data scarcity, they often rely on single-modality
knowledge or combine foundation models in an off-the-shelf manner, failing to
address the cross-modal alignment challenge. In this paper, we present TAViS, a
novel framework that \textbf{couples} the knowledge of multimodal foundation
models (ImageBind) for cross-modal alignment and a segmentation foundation
model (SAM2) for precise segmentation. However, effectively combining these
models poses two key challenges: the difficulty in transferring the knowledge
between SAM2 and ImageBind due to their different feature spaces, and the
insufficiency of using only segmentation loss for supervision. To address these
challenges, we introduce a text-bridged design with two key components: (1) a
text-bridged hybrid prompting mechanism where pseudo text provides class
prototype information while retaining modality-specific details from both audio
and visual inputs, and (2) an alignment supervision strategy that leverages
text as a bridge to align shared semantic concepts within audio-visual
modalities. Our approach achieves superior performance on single-source,
multi-source, semantic datasets, and excels in zero-shot settings.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合自监督对比学习和不确定性感知的癌症亚型分类方法，通过选择性标注关键图像，显著减少标注需求并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数字病理学中，癌症亚型分类需要大量专家标注，但标注成本高且资源有限。因此，引入不确定性感知以优化标注过程并提升模型性能。

Method: 采用自监督对比学习模型，通过计算证据向量评估预测置信度，利用不确定性分数选择关键图像进行标注，迭代优化训练。

Result: 仅需1-10%的策略性标注，即在基准数据集上达到最优性能，同时提高分类精度和效率。

Conclusion: 该方法在标注数据有限的情况下表现出色，为数字病理学中的癌症亚型分类提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Machine-learning-assisted cancer subtyping is a promising avenue in digital
pathology. Cancer subtyping models, however, require careful training using
expert annotations so that they can be inferred with a degree of known
certainty (or uncertainty). To this end, we introduce the concept of
uncertainty awareness into a self-supervised contrastive learning model. This
is achieved by computing an evidence vector at every epoch, which assesses the
model's confidence in its predictions. The derived uncertainty score is then
utilized as a metric to selectively label the most crucial images that require
further annotation, thus iteratively refining the training process. With just
1-10% of strategically selected annotations, we attain state-of-the-art
performance in cancer subtyping on benchmark datasets. Our method not only
strategically guides the annotation process to minimize the need for extensive
labeled datasets, but also improves the precision and efficiency of
classifications. This development is particularly beneficial in settings where
the availability of labeled data is limited, offering a promising direction for
future research and application in digital pathology.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为V2LMs的视觉语言模型，用于提升自动驾驶车辆（AV）感知系统的安全性，对抗攻击表现优于传统深度神经网络（DNNs）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DNNs在对抗攻击下表现脆弱，且防御机制如对抗训练会降低正常准确性。V2LMs旨在提供更鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 通过微调视觉语言模型（V2LMs）专门用于AV感知，并评估两种部署模式：Solo Mode（单任务）和Tandem Mode（多任务）。

Result: V2LMs在对抗攻击下准确性下降小于8%，显著优于DNNs的33%-46%下降。Tandem Mode在内存效率上表现更优。

Conclusion: V2LMs为AV感知系统提供了更安全、鲁棒的解决方案，尤其在对抗攻击下表现优异。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) rely on deep neural networks (DNNs) for critical
tasks such as traffic sign recognition (TSR), automated lane centering (ALC),
and vehicle detection (VD). However, these models are vulnerable to attacks
that can cause misclassifications and compromise safety. Traditional defense
mechanisms, including adversarial training, often degrade benign accuracy and
fail to generalize against unseen attacks. In this work, we introduce Vehicle
Vision Language Models (V2LMs), fine-tuned vision-language models specialized
for AV perception. Our findings demonstrate that V2LMs inherently exhibit
superior robustness against unseen attacks without requiring adversarial
training, maintaining significantly higher accuracy than conventional DNNs
under adversarial conditions. We evaluate two deployment strategies: Solo Mode,
where individual V2LMs handle specific perception tasks, and Tandem Mode, where
a single unified V2LM is fine-tuned for multiple tasks simultaneously.
Experimental results reveal that DNNs suffer performance drops of 33% to 46%
under attacks, whereas V2LMs maintain adversarial accuracy with reductions of
less than 8% on average. The Tandem Mode further offers a memory-efficient
alternative while achieving comparable robustness to Solo Mode. We also explore
integrating V2LMs as parallel components to AV perception to enhance resilience
against adversarial threats. Our results suggest that V2LMs offer a promising
path toward more secure and resilient AV perception systems.

TL;DR: FAME（Fake Attribution via Multilevel Embeddings）是一种轻量高效的时空框架，用于识别不同人脸交换模型生成的Deepfake视频。它通过空间和时间注意力机制提高准确性，并在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfake视频的广泛出现对数字安全、隐私和媒体完整性构成威胁，现有研究多集中于二元检测，而模型溯源（确定生成模型）的研究较少。

Method: FAME通过多级嵌入捕捉不同人脸交换模型的生成痕迹，结合空间和时间注意力机制以提高准确性。

Result: 在DFDM、FaceForensics++和FakeAVCeleb数据集上，FAME在准确性和运行时间上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FAME在模型溯源任务中表现出色，具有在实际法医和信息安全应用中部署的潜力。

Abstract: The widespread emergence of face-swap Deepfake videos poses growing risks to
digital security, privacy, and media integrity, necessitating effective
forensic tools for identifying the source of such manipulations. Although most
prior research has focused primarily on binary Deepfake detection, the task of
model attribution -- determining which generative model produced a given
Deepfake -- remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce FAME (Fake
Attribution via Multilevel Embeddings), a lightweight and efficient
spatio-temporal framework designed to capture subtle generative artifacts
specific to different face-swap models. FAME integrates spatial and temporal
attention mechanisms to improve attribution accuracy while remaining
computationally efficient. We evaluate our model on three challenging and
diverse datasets: Deepfake Detection and Manipulation (DFDM), FaceForensics++,
and FakeAVCeleb. Results show that FAME consistently outperforms existing
methods in both accuracy and runtime, highlighting its potential for deployment
in real-world forensic and information security applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SCD假设参考图像与查询图像视角完全对齐，不切实际。ECD旨在利用环境线索，更贴近实际应用场景。

Method: 提出新框架，通过多参考候选和语义丰富表征聚合，解决视角偏差和视野限制问题。

Result: 在三个标准基准集上表现优异，显著优于现有方法组合，接近理想设置性能。

Conclusion: ECD任务更实用，提出的框架有效解决了视角偏差问题，代码将公开。

Abstract: Humans do not memorize everything. Thus, humans recognize scene changes by
exploring the past images. However, available past (i.e., reference) images
typically represent nearby viewpoints of the present (i.e., query) scene,
rather than the identical view. Despite this practical limitation, conventional
Scene Change Detection (SCD) has been formalized under an idealized setting in
which reference images with matching viewpoints are available for every query.
In this paper, we push this problem toward a practical task and introduce
Environmental Change Detection (ECD). A key aspect of ECD is to avoid
unrealistically aligned query-reference pairs and rely solely on environmental
cues. Inspired by real-world practices, we provide these cues through a
large-scale database of uncurated images. To address this new task, we propose
a novel framework that jointly understands spatial environments and detects
changes. The main idea is that matching at the same spatial locations between a
query and a reference may lead to a suboptimal solution due to viewpoint
misalignment and limited field-of-view (FOV) coverage. We deal with this
limitation by leveraging multiple reference candidates and aggregating
semantically rich representations for change detection. We evaluate our
framework on three standard benchmark sets reconstructed for ECD, and
significantly outperform a naive combination of state-of-the-art methods while
achieving comparable performance to the oracle setting. The code will be
released upon acceptance.

Abstract: The advent of accessible Generative AI tools enables anyone to create and
spread synthetic images on social media, often with the intention to mislead,
thus posing a significant threat to online information integrity. Most existing
Synthetic Image Detection (SID) solutions struggle on generated images sourced
from the Internet, as these are often altered by compression and other
operations. To address this, our research enhances SID by exploring data
augmentation combinations, leveraging a genetic algorithm for optimal
augmentation selection, and introducing a dual-criteria optimization approach.
These methods significantly improve model performance under real-world
perturbations. Our findings provide valuable insights for developing detection
models capable of identifying synthetic images across varying qualities and
transformations, with the best-performing model achieving a mean average
precision increase of +22.53% compared to models without augmentations. The

Motivation: 现有方法虽然表现优异，但视觉嵌入分布在目标域中可能偏离预训练模型，导致伪标签误导。本文旨在通过几何关系优化伪标签和目标提示学习。

Result: 实验验证了方法的有效性，展示了性能提升和目标提示表示质量的改进。

Conclusion: 通过几何关系优化嵌入分布，显著提升了无监督域适应的性能。

Abstract: Recent approaches leveraging multi-modal pre-trained models like CLIP for
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) have shown significant promise in bridging
domain gaps and improving generalization by utilizing rich semantic knowledge
and robust visual representations learned through extensive pre-training on
diverse image-text datasets. While these methods achieve state-of-the-art
performance across benchmarks, much of the improvement stems from base
pseudo-labels (CLIP zero-shot predictions) and self-training mechanisms. Thus,
the training mechanism exhibits a key limitation wherein the visual embedding
distribution in target domains can deviate from the visual embedding
distribution in the pre-trained model, leading to misguided signals from class
descriptions. This work introduces a fresh solution to reinforce these
pseudo-labels and facilitate target-prompt learning, by exploiting the geometry
of visual and text embeddings - an aspect that is overlooked by existing
methods. We first propose to directly leverage the reference predictions (from
source prompts) based on the relationship between source and target visual
embeddings. We later show that there is a strong clustering behavior observed
between visual and text embeddings in pre-trained multi-modal models. Building
on optimal transport theory, we transform this insight into a novel strategy to
enforce the clustering property in text embeddings, further enhancing the
alignment in the target domain. Our experiments and ablation studies validate
the effectiveness of the proposed approach, demonstrating superior performance
and improved quality of target prompts in terms of representation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Manager的轻量级插件，通过自适应聚合预训练单模态专家的多层次知识，提升视觉-语言模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决BridgeTower在单模态表示利用、多层级语义知识灵活应用及低分辨率数据集评估上的局限性。

Method: 在Two-Tower VLM架构中引入ManagerTower，并在跨模态层中嵌入Manager；进一步扩展到MLLM架构。

Result: ManagerTower在4项下游任务中表现优异；LLaVA-OV-Manager在20个数据集上显著提升零样本性能。

Conclusion: Manager插件通过深度和宽度两个正交视角捕捉视觉细节，提升性能并缓解语义模糊。

Abstract: Two-Tower Vision--Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance
across various downstream VL tasks. While BridgeTower further enhances
performance by building bridges between encoders, it \textit{(i)} suffers from
ineffective layer-by-layer utilization of unimodal representations,
\textit{(ii)} restricts the flexible exploitation of different levels of
unimodal semantic knowledge, and \textit{(iii)} is limited to the evaluation on
traditional low-resolution datasets only with the Two-Tower VLM architecture.
In this work, we propose Manager, a lightweight, efficient and effective plugin
that adaptively aggregates insights from different levels of pre-trained
unimodal experts to facilitate more comprehensive VL alignment and fusion.
First, under the Two-Tower VLM architecture, we introduce ManagerTower, a novel
VLM that introduces the manager in each cross-modal layer. Whether with or
without VL pre-training, ManagerTower outperforms previous strong baselines and
achieves superior performance on 4 downstream VL tasks. Moreover, we extend our
exploration to the latest Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) architecture.
We demonstrate that LLaVA-OV-Manager significantly boosts the zero-shot
performance of LLaVA-OV across different categories of capabilities, images,
and resolutions on 20 downstream datasets, whether the multi-grid algorithm is
enabled or not. In-depth analysis reveals that both our manager and the
multi-grid algorithm can be viewed as a plugin that improves the visual
representation by capturing more diverse visual details from two orthogonal
perspectives (depth and width). Their synergy can mitigate the semantic
ambiguity caused by the multi-grid algorithm and further improve performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的GNSS-惯性初始化策略，通过延迟使用全局GNSS测量数据，转而依赖相对距离残差，并在Hessian矩阵奇异值变化的基础上确定切换时机，以提高初始化的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传感器平台的初始状态估计常因初始测量信息有限而导致估计不准确，甚至陷入局部最优解。

Method: 提出了一种策略，先依赖GNSS相对距离残差，待信息充足后通过Hessian矩阵奇异值变化判断切换至全局GNSS测量的时机。

Result: 在EuRoC和GVINS数据集上的实验表明，该方法比直接使用全局GNSS数据的策略更准确和鲁棒。

Conclusion: 该方法通过优化切换时机，显著提升了初始化的性能。

Abstract: Initializing the state of a sensorized platform can be challenging, as a
limited set of initial measurements often carry limited information, leading to
poor initial estimates that may converge to local minima during non-linear
optimization. This paper proposes a novel GNSS-inertial initialization strategy
that delays the use of global GNSS measurements until sufficient information is
available to accurately estimate the transformation between the GNSS and
inertial frames. Instead, the method initially relies on GNSS relative distance
residuals. To determine the optimal moment for switching to global
measurements, we introduce a criterion based on the evolution of the Hessian
matrix singular values. Experiments on the EuRoC and GVINS datasets show that
our approach consistently outperforms the naive strategy of using global GNSS
data from the start, yielding more accurate and robust initializations.

Motivation: 当前ViTs的后训练量化方法在低比特量化下存在显著的精度下降问题，传统Hessian近似方法存在局限性。

Method: 基于块级重建框架，提出FIMA-Q方法，通过KL散度与FIM的联系快速计算量化损失，并采用DPLR-FIM近似FIM。

Result: 在多种ViT架构和公共数据集上的实验表明，FIMA-Q显著提升了量化精度，尤其在低比特量化下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FIMA-Q为ViTs的后训练量化提供了一种高效且高精度的解决方案，尤其在低比特量化场景下表现优异。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has stood out as a cost-effective and
promising model compression paradigm in recent years, as it avoids
computationally intensive model retraining. Nevertheless, current PTQ methods
for Vision Transformers (ViTs) still suffer from significant accuracy
degradation, especially under low-bit quantization. To address these
shortcomings, we analyze the prevailing Hessian-guided quantization loss, and
uncover certain limitations of conventional Hessian approximations. By
following the block-wise reconstruction framework, we propose a novel PTQ
method for ViTs, dubbed FIMA-Q. Specifically, we firstly establish the
connection between KL divergence and FIM, which enables fast computation of the
quantization loss during reconstruction. We further propose an efficient FIM
approximation method, namely DPLR-FIM, by employing the diagonal plus low-rank
principle, and formulate the ultimate quantization loss. Our extensive
experiments, conducted across various vision tasks with representative
ViT-based architectures on public datasets, demonstrate that our method
substantially promotes the accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art
approaches, especially in the case of low-bit quantization. The source code is

Conclusion: 实验验证了该方法的有效性和鲁棒性，为旋转估计问题提供了一种新的解决方案。

Abstract: Rotation estimation plays a fundamental role in computer vision and robot
tasks, and extremely robust rotation estimation is significantly useful for
safety-critical applications. Typically, estimating a rotation is considered a
non-linear and non-convex optimization problem that requires careful design.
However, in this paper, we provide some new perspectives that solving a
rotation estimation problem can be reformulated as solving a linear model
fitting problem without dropping any constraints and without introducing any
singularities. In addition, we explore the dual structure of a rotation motion,
revealing that it can be represented as a great circle on a quaternion sphere
surface. Accordingly, we propose an easily understandable voting-based method
to solve rotation estimation. The proposed method exhibits exceptional
robustness to noise and outliers and can be computed in parallel with graphics
processing units (GPUs) effortlessly. Particularly, leveraging the power of
GPUs, the proposed method can obtain a satisfactory rotation solution for
large-scale($10^6$) and severely corrupted (99$\%$ outlier ratio) rotation
estimation problems under 0.5 seconds. Furthermore, to validate our theoretical
framework and demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, we conduct
controlled experiments and real-world dataset experiments. These experiments
provide compelling evidence supporting the effectiveness and robustness of our
approach in solving rotation estimation problems.

Result: 在时间定位和视频问答任务中，DaMO表现优于现有方法，尤其在需要精确时间对齐的任务中。

Conclusion: DaMO为数据高效的视频-语言建模提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been extended to the video domain,
enabling sophisticated video-language understanding. However, existing Video
LLMs often exhibit limitations in fine-grained temporal reasoning, restricting
their ability to precisely attribute responses to specific video moments,
especially under constrained supervision. We introduce DaMO, a data-efficient
Video LLM explicitly designed for accurate temporal reasoning and multimodal
understanding. At its core, the proposed Temporal-aware Fuseformer employs a
hierarchical dual-stream architecture that progressively captures temporal
dynamics within each modality and effectively fuses complementary visual and
audio information. To further enhance computational efficiency, DaMO integrates
a global residual that reduces spatial redundancy while preserving essential
semantic details. We train DaMO via a structured four-stage progressive
training paradigm, incrementally equipping the model with multimodal alignment,
semantic grounding, and temporal reasoning capabilities. This work also
contributes multiple datasets augmented from existing ones with GPT-generated
temporally grounded QA pairs for tasks requiring temporal supervision.
Comprehensive experiments on temporal grounding and video QA benchmarks
demonstrate that DaMO consistently surpasses prior methods, particularly in
tasks demanding precise temporal alignment and reasoning. Our work establishes
a promising direction for data-efficient video-language modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管长链思维（CoT）能提升MLLMs解决复杂问题的能力，但其有效性原因尚不明确，尤其是视觉线索提取与推理过程对性能提升的贡献难以量化。

Method: 通过GPT-Image-1辅助的自动编辑流程，精确修改图像中的视觉线索，并构建VFaith-Bench基准，包含755个条目和人类标注的感知任务。

Result: 测试主流模型后发现，编辑后的图像问题对准确率的影响揭示了模型推理能力与视觉感知的关系，并设计了特定指标量化这种关系。

Conclusion: VFaith-Bench为评估MLLMs的视觉推理忠实性提供了有效工具，揭示了模型推理能力的来源及其与视觉感知的关联。

Abstract: Recent extensive works have demonstrated that by introducing long CoT, the
capabilities of MLLMs to solve complex problems can be effectively enhanced.
However, the reasons for the effectiveness of such paradigms remain unclear. It
is challenging to analysis with quantitative results how much the model's
specific extraction of visual cues and its subsequent so-called reasoning
during inference process contribute to the performance improvements. Therefore,
evaluating the faithfulness of MLLMs' reasoning to visual information is
crucial. To address this issue, we first present a cue-driven automatic and
controllable editing pipeline with the help of GPT-Image-1. It enables the
automatic and precise editing of specific visual cues based on the instruction.
Furthermore, we introduce VFaith-Bench, the first benchmark to evaluate MLLMs'
visual reasoning capabilities and analyze the source of such capabilities with
an emphasis on the visual faithfulness. Using the designed pipeline, we
constructed comparative question-answer pairs by altering the visual cues in
images that are crucial for solving the original reasoning problem, thereby
changing the question's answer. By testing similar questions with images that
have different details, the average accuracy reflects the model's visual
reasoning ability, while the difference in accuracy before and after editing
the test set images effectively reveals the relationship between the model's
reasoning ability and visual perception. We further designed specific metrics
to expose this relationship. VFaith-Bench includes 755 entries divided into
five distinct subsets, along with an additional human-labeled perception task.
We conducted in-depth testing and analysis of existing mainstream flagship
models and prominent open-source model series/reasoning models on VFaith-Bench,
further investigating the underlying factors of their reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: The identification and classification of vehicles play a crucial role in
various aspects of the control-sanction system. Current technologies such as
weigh-in-motion (WIM) systems can classify most vehicle categories but they
struggle to accurately classify vehicles with lifted axles. Moreover, very few
commercial and technical methods exist for detecting lifted axles. In this
paper, as part of the European project SETO (Smart Enforcement of Transport
Operations), a method based on a convolutional neural network (CNN), namely
YOLOv8s, was proposed for the detection of lifted truck axles in images of
trucks captured by cameras placed perpendicular to the direction of traffic.
The performance of the proposed method was assessed and it was found that it
had a precision of 87%, a recall of 91.7%, and an inference time of 1.4 ms,
which makes it well-suited for real time implantations. These results suggest
that further improvements could be made, potentially by increasing the size of
the datasets and/or by using various image augmentation methods.

Result: 在ScanNet200和Replica数据集上展示了优异的零样本性能、鲁棒性和适应性。

Conclusion: 该方法无需依赖3D监督分割模型，适用于多样化的真实环境。

Abstract: We introduce OV-MAP, a novel approach to open-world 3D mapping for mobile
robots by integrating open-features into 3D maps to enhance object recognition
capabilities. A significant challenge arises when overlapping features from
adjacent voxels reduce instance-level precision, as features spill over voxel
boundaries, blending neighboring regions together. Our method overcomes this by
employing a class-agnostic segmentation model to project 2D masks into 3D
space, combined with a supplemented depth image created by merging raw and
synthetic depth from point clouds. This approach, along with a 3D mask voting
mechanism, enables accurate zero-shot 3D instance segmentation without relying
on 3D supervised segmentation models. We assess the effectiveness of our method
through comprehensive experiments on public datasets such as ScanNet200 and
Replica, demonstrating superior zero-shot performance, robustness, and
adaptability across diverse environments. Additionally, we conducted real-world
experiments to demonstrate our method's adaptability and robustness when
applied to diverse real-world environments.

TL;DR: 论文提出了EasyARC，一个多模态推理基准，结合视觉和文本，支持多图像、多步骤推理和自我纠正，用于评估视觉语言模型的真实推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要测试视觉提取与文本推理的结合，缺乏视觉与语言间复杂交互的真实推理能力。

Method: 通过程序化生成EasyARC基准，包含渐进难度级别，支持强化学习流程，并开源数据集和评估代码。

Result: 评估了最先进的视觉语言模型，分析了其失败模式，证明EasyARC为评估真实推理能力提供了新标准。

Conclusion: EasyARC为视觉语言模型的真实推理和测试时扩展能力设定了新标准。

Abstract: Building on recent advances in language-based reasoning models, we explore
multimodal reasoning that integrates vision and text. Existing multimodal
benchmarks primarily test visual extraction combined with text-based reasoning,
lacking true visual reasoning with more complex interactions between vision and
language. Inspired by the ARC challenge, we introduce EasyARC, a
vision-language benchmark requiring multi-image, multi-step reasoning, and
self-correction. EasyARC is procedurally generated, fully verifiable, and
scalable, making it ideal for reinforcement learning (RL) pipelines. The
generators incorporate progressive difficulty levels, enabling structured
evaluation across task types and complexities. We benchmark state-of-the-art
vision-language models and analyze their failure modes. We argue that EasyARC
sets a new standard for evaluating true reasoning and test-time scaling
capabilities in vision-language models. We open-source our benchmark dataset
and evaluation code.

TL;DR: A$^2$LC是一种高效的主动标签校正框架，通过自动化校正和自适应平衡采集函数，显著提升了语义分割中的标签校正效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语义分割中手动像素级标注成本高且易出错的问题，通过选择性校正错误标签。

Method: 提出A$^2$LC框架，结合自动化校正阶段和自适应平衡采集函数，利用标注者反馈扩展校正范围。

Result: 在Cityscapes和PASCAL VOC 2012上显著优于现有方法，仅用20%预算即可超越，性能提升27.23%。

Conclusion: A$^2$LC在效率和效果上均表现出色，为语义分割标签校正提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Active Label Correction (ALC) has emerged as a promising solution to the high
cost and error-prone nature of manual pixel-wise annotation in semantic
segmentation, by selectively identifying and correcting mislabeled data.
Although recent work has improved correction efficiency by generating
pseudo-labels using foundation models, substantial inefficiencies still remain.
In this paper, we propose Active and Automated Label Correction for semantic
segmentation (A$^2$LC), a novel and efficient ALC framework that integrates an
automated correction stage into the conventional pipeline. Specifically, the
automated correction stage leverages annotator feedback to perform label
correction beyond the queried samples, thereby maximizing cost efficiency. In
addition, we further introduce an adaptively balanced acquisition function that
emphasizes underrepresented tail classes and complements the automated
correction mechanism. Extensive experiments on Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC 2012
demonstrate that A$^2$LC significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art
methods. Notably, A$^2$LC achieves high efficiency by outperforming previous
methods using only 20% of their budget, and demonstrates strong effectiveness
by yielding a 27.23% performance improvement under an equivalent budget
constraint on the Cityscapes dataset. The code will be released upon
acceptance.

Motivation: 现有方法通常只关注单一数据类型，忽略了多特征的交互与融合。

Method: 采用双分支自注意力模块捕获模态内时空线索，通过组注意力机制挖掘关键特征，并利用门控机制优化信息熵。

Result: 在Widar3.0和XRF55数据集上表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: 多模态协作感知方法显著提升了行为识别的准确性。

Abstract: WiFi-based human behavior recognition aims to recognize gestures and
activities by analyzing wireless signal variations. However, existing methods
typically focus on a single type of data, neglecting the interaction and fusion
of multiple features. To this end, we propose a novel multimodal collaborative
awareness method. By leveraging phase data reflecting changes in dynamic path
length and Doppler Shift (DFS) data corresponding to frequency changes related
to the speed of gesture movement, we enable efficient interaction and fusion of
these features to improve recognition accuracy. Specifically, we first
introduce a dual-branch self-attention module to capture spatial-temporal cues
within each modality. Then, a group attention mechanism is applied to the
concatenated phase and DFS features to mine key group features critical for
behavior recognition. Through a gating mechanism, the combined features are
further divided into PD-strengthen and PD-weaken branches, optimizing
information entropy and promoting cross-modal collaborative awareness.
Extensive in-domain and cross-domain experiments on two large publicly
available datasets, Widar3.0 and XRF55, demonstrate the superior performance of
our method.

Motivation: 由于手语的复杂性（包括手势、面部表情和身体动作），生成逼真且自然的手语表示仍是一个挑战。

Method: SignAligner方法包括三个阶段：1）文本驱动的姿势模态共生成，2）在线协作校正，3）视频合成。使用Transformer架构提取文本语义，并通过跨模态注意力机制生成多样化的手语表示。

Result: 实验表明，SignAligner显著提高了生成手语视频的准确性和表现力。

Conclusion: SignAligner通过多模态协作和动态校正，成功实现了逼真手语视频的生成，为手语生成领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Sign language generation aims to produce diverse sign representations based
on spoken language. However, achieving realistic and naturalistic generation
remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of sign language, which
encompasses intricate hand gestures, facial expressions, and body movements. In
this work, we introduce PHOENIX14T+, an extended version of the widely-used
RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather 2014T dataset, featuring three new sign representations:
Pose, Hamer and Smplerx. We also propose a novel method, SignAligner, for
realistic sign language generation, consisting of three stages: text-driven
pose modalities co-generation, online collaborative correction of
multimodality, and realistic sign video synthesis. First, by incorporating text
semantics, we design a joint sign language generator to simultaneously produce
posture coordinates, gesture actions, and body movements. The text encoder,
based on a Transformer architecture, extracts semantic features, while a
cross-modal attention mechanism integrates these features to generate diverse
sign language representations, ensuring accurate mapping and controlling the
diversity of modal features. Next, online collaborative correction is
introduced to refine the generated pose modalities using a dynamic loss
weighting strategy and cross-modal attention, facilitating the complementarity
of information across modalities, eliminating spatiotemporal conflicts, and
ensuring semantic coherence and action consistency. Finally, the corrected pose
modalities are fed into a pre-trained video generation network to produce
high-fidelity sign language videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SignAligner significantly improves both the accuracy and expressiveness of the
generated sign videos.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肤色作为敏感属性在计算机视觉中以张量形式存在，不同于传统的分类特征（如性别和种族），现有公平性研究对此关注不足。

Method: 将肤色张量数据转换为概率分布，应用统计距离度量，并提出基于贝叶斯回归和多项式函数的训练方法以减少潜在偏差。

Conclusion: 该技术为机器学习公平性提供了更灵活和细致的评估与优化手段，尤其在肤色相关的任务中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Fairness is a critical component of Trustworthy AI. In this paper, we focus
on Machine Learning (ML) and the performance of model predictions when dealing
with skin color. Unlike other sensitive attributes, the nature of skin color
differs significantly. In computer vision, skin color is represented as tensor
data rather than categorical values or single numerical points. However, much
of the research on fairness across sensitive groups has focused on categorical
features such as gender and race. This paper introduces a new technique for
evaluating fairness in ML for image classification tasks, specifically without
the use of annotation. To address the limitations of prior work, we handle
tensor data, like skin color, without classifying it rigidly. Instead, we
convert it into probability distributions and apply statistical distance
measures. This novel approach allows us to capture fine-grained nuances in
fairness both within and across what would traditionally be considered distinct
groups. Additionally, we propose an innovative training method to mitigate the
latent biases present in conventional skin tone categorization. This method
leverages color distance estimates calculated through Bayesian regression with
polynomial functions, ensuring a more nuanced and equitable treatment of skin
color in ML models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种标准反因果预测模型（SAM）和一种新的正则化策略DISCO，用于解决预测任务中模型依赖无关信号的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在预测任务中，模型可能依赖无关的因果信号（如光照条件）而非真实特征，导致预测偏差。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 引入SAM模型构建因果框架，并提出DISCO正则化策略，通过条件距离相关性优化回归任务中的条件独立性。

Result: 实验表明，DISCO在多种偏差缓解任务中表现优异，可作为传统核方法的替代方案。

Conclusion: SAM和DISCO为反因果预测提供了有效的解决方案，能够减少无关信号的影响。

Abstract: During prediction tasks, models can use any signal they receive to come up
with the final answer - including signals that are causally irrelevant. When
predicting objects from images, for example, the lighting conditions could be
correlated to different targets through selection bias, and an oblivious model
might use these signals as shortcuts to discern between various objects. A
predictor that uses lighting conditions instead of real object-specific details
is obviously undesirable. To address this challenge, we introduce a standard
anti-causal prediction model (SAM) that creates a causal framework for
analyzing the information pathways influencing our predictor in anti-causal
settings. We demonstrate that a classifier satisfying a specific conditional
independence criterion will focus solely on the direct causal path from label
to image, being counterfactually invariant to the remaining variables. Finally,
we propose DISCO, a novel regularization strategy that uses conditional
distance correlation to optimize for conditional independence in regression
tasks. We can show that DISCO achieves competitive results in different bias
mitigation experiments, deeming it a valid alternative to classical
kernel-based methods.

Motivation: X射线图像中违禁物品的外观与自然物体差异显著，且物品间重叠严重，导致实例分割任务具有挑战性。

Method: 结合SAM的丰富先验和零样本泛化能力，设计了遮挡感知双层掩码解码器模块，并标注了两个大规模X射线图像数据集（PIDray-A和PIXray-A）以监督遮挡估计。

Result: 在标注的遮挡数据集上进行了广泛实验，证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了X射线图像中违禁物品的实例分割问题，相关数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: Instance segmentation of prohibited items in security X-ray images is a
critical yet challenging task. This is mainly caused by the significant
appearance gap between prohibited items in X-ray images and natural objects, as
well as the severe overlapping among objects in X-ray images. To address these
issues, we propose an occlusion-aware instance segmentation pipeline designed
to identify prohibited items in X-ray images. Specifically, to bridge the
representation gap, we integrate the Segment Anything Model (SAM) into our
pipeline, taking advantage of its rich priors and zero-shot generalization
capabilities. To address the overlap between prohibited items, we design an
occlusion-aware bilayer mask decoder module that explicitly models the
occlusion relationships. To supervise occlusion estimation, we manually
annotated occlusion areas of prohibited items in two large-scale X-ray image
segmentation datasets, PIDray and PIXray. We then reorganized these additional
annotations together with the original information as two occlusion-annotated
datasets, PIDray-A and PIXray-A. Extensive experimental results on these
occlusion-annotated datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
method. The datasets and codes are available at: https://github.com/Ryh1218/Occ

Result: 实验表明，D-MoLE在性能上显著优于现有基线方法，平均提升15%。

Conclusion: 这是首次从架构角度研究MLLMs的持续学习问题，D-MoLE方法为解决任务适应性和模态不平衡提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Continual multimodal instruction tuning is crucial for adapting Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) to evolving tasks. However, most existing methods
adopt a fixed architecture, struggling with adapting to new tasks due to static
model capacity. We propose to evolve the architecture under parameter budgets
for dynamic task adaptation, which remains unexplored and imposes two
challenges: 1) task architecture conflict, where different tasks require
varying layer-wise adaptations, and 2) modality imbalance, where different
tasks rely unevenly on modalities, leading to unbalanced updates. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel Dynamic Mixture of Curriculum LoRA Experts
(D-MoLE) method, which automatically evolves MLLM's architecture with
controlled parameter budgets to continually adapt to new tasks while retaining
previously learned knowledge. Specifically, we propose a dynamic layer-wise
expert allocator, which automatically allocates LoRA experts across layers to
resolve architecture conflicts, and routes instructions layer-wisely to
facilitate knowledge sharing among experts. Then, we propose a gradient-based
inter-modal continual curriculum, which adjusts the update ratio of each module
in MLLM based on the difficulty of each modality within the task to alleviate
the modality imbalance problem. Extensive experiments show that D-MoLE
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a 15% average
improvement over the best baseline. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study of continual learning for MLLMs from an architectural perspective.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在医学视觉表示学习中存在负样本选择不当、忽略局部细节和低层特征的问题，影响了诊断准确性。

Method: CM-CGNS通过跨模态注意力扩展k-means聚类，并引入跨模态掩码图像重建模块（CM-MIR），增强模型的多模态交互能力。

Result: 在五个下游数据集上的实验表明，该方法在分类、检测和分割任务中均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CM-CGNS能够学习到更有效和鲁棒的医学视觉表示，适用于多种识别任务。

Abstract: Learning medical visual representations directly from paired images and
reports through multimodal self-supervised learning has emerged as a novel and
efficient approach to digital diagnosis in recent years. However, existing
models suffer from several severe limitations. 1) neglecting the selection of
negative samples, resulting in the scarcity of hard negatives and the inclusion
of false negatives; 2) focusing on global feature extraction, but overlooking
the fine-grained local details that are crucial for medical image recognition
tasks; and 3) contrastive learning primarily targets high-level features but
ignoring low-level details which are essential for accurate medical analysis.
Motivated by these critical issues, this paper presents a Cross-Modal
Cluster-Guided Negative Sampling (CM-CGNS) method with two-fold ideas. First,
it extends the k-means clustering used for local text features in the
single-modal domain to the multimodal domain through cross-modal attention.
This improvement increases the number of negative samples and boosts the model
representation capability. Second, it introduces a Cross-Modal Masked Image
Reconstruction (CM-MIR) module that leverages local text-to-image features
obtained via cross-modal attention to reconstruct masked local image regions.
This module significantly strengthens the model's cross-modal information
interaction capabilities and retains low-level image features essential for
downstream tasks. By well handling the aforementioned limitations, the proposed
CM-CGNS can learn effective and robust medical visual representations suitable
for various recognition tasks. Extensive experimental results on
classification, detection, and segmentation tasks across five downstream
datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on
multiple metrics, verifying its superior performance.

Conclusion: 气道影像特征对肺纤维化患者生存预测具有潜在价值。

Abstract: The primary objective of the AIIB 2023 competition is to evaluate the
predictive significance of airway-related imaging biomarkers in determining the
survival outcomes of patients with lung fibrosis.This study introduces a
comprehensive three-stage approach. Initially, a segmentation network, namely
nn-Unet, is employed to delineate the airway's structural boundaries.
Subsequently, key features are extracted from the radiomic images centered
around the trachea and an enclosing bounding box around the airway. This step
is motivated by the potential presence of critical survival-related insights
within the tracheal region as well as pertinent information encoded in the
structure and dimensions of the airway. Lastly, radiomic features obtained from
the segmented areas are integrated into an SVM classifier. We could obtain an
overall-score of 0.8601 for the segmentation in Task 1 while 0.7346 for the
classification in Task 2.

Result: ViT的测试准确率最高（90%），显著优于卷积网络（约35%）和CLIP模型（约62-64%）。可解释性分析显示ViT更关注动作相关区域。

Conclusion: Transformer模型在数据效率和性能上表现优异，可解释性技术有助于诊断模型错误。

Abstract: This study explores human action recognition using a three-class subset of
the COCO image corpus, benchmarking models from simple fully connected networks
to transformer architectures. The binary Vision Transformer (ViT) achieved 90%
mean test accuracy, significantly exceeding multiclass classifiers such as
convolutional networks (approximately 35%) and CLIP-based models (approximately
62-64%). A one-way ANOVA (F = 61.37, p < 0.001) confirmed these differences are
statistically significant. Qualitative analysis with SHAP explainer and LeGrad
heatmaps indicated that the ViT localizes pose-specific regions (e.g., lower
limbs for walking or running), while simpler feed-forward models often focus on
background textures, explaining their errors. These findings emphasize the data
efficiency of transformer representations and the importance of explainability
techniques in diagnosing class-specific failures.

Conclusion: MTabVQA为多表格视觉推理提供了重要评估工具，指令调优能有效提升模型性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
interpreting visual layouts and text. However, a significant challenge remains
in their ability to interpret robustly and reason over multi-tabular data
presented as images, a common occurrence in real-world scenarios like web pages
and digital documents. Existing benchmarks typically address single tables or
non-visual data (text/structured). This leaves a critical gap: they don't
assess the ability to parse diverse table images, correlate information across
them, and perform multi-hop reasoning on the combined visual data. We introduce
MTabVQA, a novel benchmark specifically designed for multi-tabular visual
question answering to bridge that gap. MTabVQA comprises 3,745 complex
question-answer pairs that necessitate multi-hop reasoning across several
visually rendered table images. We provide extensive benchmark results for
state-of-the-art VLMs on MTabVQA, revealing significant performance
limitations. We further investigate post-training techniques to enhance these
reasoning abilities and release MTabVQA-Instruct, a large-scale
instruction-tuning dataset. Our experiments show that fine-tuning VLMs with
MTabVQA-Instruct substantially improves their performance on visual
multi-tabular reasoning. Code and dataset

Result: 在BraTS2020和MyoPS2020数据集上，DMAF-Net表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DMAF-Net有效解决了多模态医学图像分割中的模态不平衡问题，提升了分割性能。

Abstract: Incomplete multi-modal medical image segmentation faces critical challenges
from modality imbalance, including imbalanced modality missing rates and
heterogeneous modality contributions. Due to their reliance on idealized
assumptions of complete modality availability, existing methods fail to
dynamically balance contributions and neglect the structural relationships
between modalities, resulting in suboptimal performance in real-world clinical
scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel model, named
Dynamic Modality-Aware Fusion Network (DMAF-Net). The DMAF-Net adopts three key
ideas. First, it introduces a Dynamic Modality-Aware Fusion (DMAF) module to
suppress missing-modality interference by combining transformer attention with
adaptive masking and weight modality contributions dynamically through
attention maps. Second, it designs a synergistic Relation Distillation and
Prototype Distillation framework to enforce global-local feature alignment via
covariance consistency and masked graph attention, while ensuring semantic
consistency through cross-modal class-specific prototype alignment. Third, it
presents a Dynamic Training Monitoring (DTM) strategy to stabilize optimization
under imbalanced missing rates by tracking distillation gaps in real-time, and
to balance convergence speeds across modalities by adaptively reweighting
losses and scaling gradients. Extensive experiments on BraTS2020 and MyoPS2020
demonstrate that DMAF-Net outperforms existing methods for incomplete
multi-modal medical image segmentation. Extensive experiments on BraTS2020 and

*Linfeng He,Meiqin Liu,Qi Tang,Chao Yao,Yao Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MambaVSR是一种基于状态空间模型的视频超分辨率方法，通过动态时空交互和内容感知机制，解决了传统方法在处理大位移和长序列时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频超分辨率（VSR）在建模非局部依赖性和保持计算效率方面面临挑战，传统方法如光流或Transformer难以处理大位移和长序列。

Method: 提出MambaVSR框架，包含Shared Compass Construction（SCC）和Content-Aware Sequentialization（CAS）模块，通过动态扫描和全局-局部状态空间块（GLSSB）实现高效时空交互。

Result: 在REDS数据集上，MambaVSR比基于Transformer的方法PSNR提升0.58 dB，且参数减少55%。

Conclusion: MambaVSR通过创新的内容感知机制和状态空间模型，显著提升了视频超分辨率的性能，同时降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Video super-resolution (VSR) faces critical challenges in effectively
modeling non-local dependencies across misaligned frames while preserving
computational efficiency. Existing VSR methods typically rely on optical flow
strategies or transformer architectures, which struggle with large motion
displacements and long video sequences. To address this, we propose MambaVSR,
the first state-space model framework for VSR that incorporates an innovative
content-aware scanning mechanism. Unlike rigid 1D sequential processing in
conventional vision Mamba methods, our MambaVSR enables dynamic spatiotemporal
interactions through the Shared Compass Construction (SCC) and the
Content-Aware Sequentialization (CAS). Specifically, the SCC module constructs
intra-frame semantic connectivity graphs via efficient sparse attention and
generates adaptive spatial scanning sequences through spectral clustering.
Building upon SCC, the CAS module effectively aligns and aggregates non-local
similar content across multiple frames by interleaving temporal features along
the learned spatial order. To bridge global dependencies with local details,
the Global-Local State Space Block (GLSSB) synergistically integrates window
self-attention operations with SSM-based feature propagation, enabling
high-frequency detail recovery under global dependency guidance. Extensive
experiments validate MambaVSR's superiority, outperforming the
Transformer-based method by 0.58 dB PSNR on the REDS dataset with 55% fewer
parameters.

*Byeongchan Lee,John Won,Seunghyun Lee,Jinwoo Shin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIPFUSION结合判别式和生成式基础模型，通过多模态融合解决异常检测中的复杂问题，显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异常检测因定义模糊、类型多样且数据稀缺而复杂，需能同时捕捉高低级特征的模型。

Method: 利用CLIP判别模型捕捉全局特征，扩散生成模型捕捉局部细节，并通过跨注意力图和特征图进行异常检测。

Result: 在MVTec-AD和VisA数据集上，CLIPFUSION在异常分割和分类中表现优异。

Conclusion: 多模态和多模型融合有效解决异常检测的多方面挑战，为实际应用提供可扩展方案。

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a complex problem due to the ambiguity in defining
anomalies, the diversity of anomaly types (e.g., local and global defect), and
the scarcity of training data. As such, it necessitates a comprehensive model
capable of capturing both low-level and high-level features, even with limited
data. To address this, we propose CLIPFUSION, a method that leverages both
discriminative and generative foundation models. Specifically, the CLIP-based
discriminative model excels at capturing global features, while the
diffusion-based generative model effectively captures local details, creating a
synergistic and complementary approach. Notably, we introduce a methodology for
utilizing cross-attention maps and feature maps extracted from diffusion models
specifically for anomaly detection. Experimental results on benchmark datasets
(MVTec-AD, VisA) demonstrate that CLIPFUSION consistently outperforms baseline
methods, achieving outstanding performance in both anomaly segmentation and
classification. We believe that our method underscores the effectiveness of
multi-modal and multi-model fusion in tackling the multifaceted challenges of
anomaly detection, providing a scalable solution for real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AgentSense利用虚拟数据生成管道，通过大型语言模型创建多样化用户行为数据，显著提升智能家居活动识别系统的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能家居活动识别系统缺乏大规模多样化标注数据，且用户行为和家庭环境差异大，导致系统泛化能力不足。

Method: 提出AgentSense，利用虚拟环境和虚拟传感器生成多样化用户行为数据，结合真实数据训练模型。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上，虚拟数据显著提升模型性能，少量真实数据结合虚拟数据即可媲美全量真实数据训练效果。

Conclusion: 虚拟数据能有效解决智能家居活动识别中数据不足的问题，无需人工标注。

Abstract: A major obstacle in developing robust and generalizable smart home-based
Human Activity Recognition (HAR) systems is the lack of large-scale, diverse
labeled datasets. Variability in home layouts, sensor configurations, and user
behavior adds further complexity, as individuals follow varied routines and
perform activities in distinct ways. Building HAR systems that generalize well
requires training data that captures the diversity across users and
environments. To address these challenges, we introduce AgentSense, a virtual
data generation pipeline where diverse personas are generated by leveraging
Large Language Models. These personas are used to create daily routines, which
are then decomposed into low-level action sequences. Subsequently, the actions
are executed in a simulated home environment called VirtualHome that we
extended with virtual ambient sensors capable of recording the agents
activities as they unfold. Overall, AgentSense enables the generation of rich,
virtual sensor datasets that represent a wide range of users and home settings.
Across five benchmark HAR datasets, we show that leveraging our virtual sensor
data substantially improves performance, particularly when real data are
limited. Notably, models trained on a combination of virtual data and just a
few days of real data achieve performance comparable to those trained on the
entire real datasets. These results demonstrate and prove the potential of
virtual data to address one of the most pressing challenges in ambient sensing,
which is the distinct lack of large-scale, annotated datasets without requiring
any manual data collection efforts.

Result: 系统提高了智能个性化家庭锻炼系统的可行性，并扩展了其在康复和物理治疗等领域的应用潜力。

Conclusion: 实时反馈系统为家庭锻炼提供了专家级诊断，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: Isometric exercises appeal to individuals seeking convenience, privacy, and
minimal dependence on equipments. However, such fitness training is often
overdependent on unreliable digital media content instead of expert
supervision, introducing serious risks, including incorrect posture, injury,
and disengagement due to lack of corrective feedback. To address these
challenges, we present a real-time feedback system for assessing isometric
poses. Our contributions include the release of the largest multiclass
isometric exercise video dataset to date, comprising over 3,600 clips across
six poses with correct and incorrect variations. To support robust evaluation,
we benchmark state-of-the-art models-including graph-based networks-on this
dataset and introduce a novel three-part metric that captures classification
accuracy, mistake localization, and model confidence. Our results enhance the
feasibility of intelligent and personalized exercise training systems for home
workouts. This expert-level diagnosis, delivered directly to the users, also
expands the potential applications of these systems to rehabilitation,
physiotherapy, and various other fitness disciplines that involve physical
motion.

TL;DR: DISCOVR是一种自监督双分支框架，用于心脏超声视频表示学习，结合聚类视频编码器和在线图像编码器，通过语义聚类蒸馏损失提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声心动图领域缺乏特定领域的预训练模型，现有自监督学习方法在处理高样本相似性和低PSNR输入时表现不佳。

Method: DISCOVR结合聚类视频编码器和在线图像编码器，通过语义聚类蒸馏损失将解剖知识从图像编码器传递到视频编码器。

Result: 在六个超声心动图数据集上，DISCOVR在零样本和线性探测设置中优于现有方法，并实现更好的分割迁移性能。

Conclusion: DISCOVR通过双分支框架和知识蒸馏，显著提升了超声视频表示学习的性能。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved major advances in natural images
and video understanding, but challenges remain in domains like echocardiography
(heart ultrasound) due to subtle anatomical structures, complex temporal
dynamics, and the current lack of domain-specific pre-trained models. Existing
SSL approaches such as contrastive, masked modeling, and clustering-based
methods struggle with high intersample similarity, sensitivity to low PSNR
inputs common in ultrasound, or aggressive augmentations that distort
clinically relevant features. We present DISCOVR (Distilled Image Supervision
for Cross Modal Video Representation), a self-supervised dual branch framework
for cardiac ultrasound video representation learning. DISCOVR combines a
clustering-based video encoder that models temporal dynamics with an online
image encoder that extracts fine-grained spatial semantics. These branches are
connected through a semantic cluster distillation loss that transfers
anatomical knowledge from the evolving image encoder to the video encoder,
enabling temporally coherent representations enriched with fine-grained
semantic understanding. Evaluated on six echocardiography datasets spanning
fetal, pediatric, and adult populations, DISCOVR outperforms both specialized
video anomaly detection methods and state-of-the-art video-SSL baselines in
zero-shot and linear probing setups, and achieves superior segmentation
transfer.

*Guang Liang,Xinyao Liu,Jianxin Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPLQ是一种高效的ViT量化框架，通过分阶段量化激活和权重，显著提升了4位量化模型的性能，同时降低了计算和内存开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PTQ和QAT方法在ViT量化中存在精度下降、计算成本高、泛化能力差等问题，GPLQ旨在解决这些挑战。

Method: GPLQ采用两阶段策略：第一阶段量化激活并保持权重为FP32，第二阶段量化权重。通过特征模仿损失和保持优化“basin”来维持泛化能力。

Result: GPLQ比QAT快100倍，内存开销低于FP32训练，4位量化模型在ImageNet和下游任务中性能接近FP32模型。

Conclusion: GPLQ为ViT量化提供了一种高效、通用的解决方案，并计划开源工具包支持多种视觉任务。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) are essential in computer vision but are
computationally intensive, too. Model quantization, particularly to low
bit-widths like 4-bit, aims to alleviate this difficulty, yet existing
Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) methods
exhibit significant limitations. PTQ often incurs substantial accuracy drop,
while QAT achieves high accuracy but suffers from prohibitive computational
costs, limited generalization to downstream tasks, training instability, and
lacking of open-source codebase. To address these challenges, this paper
introduces General, Practical, and Lightning Quantization (GPLQ), a novel
framework designed for efficient and effective ViT quantization. GPLQ is
founded on two key empirical insights: the paramount importance of activation
quantization and the necessity of preserving the model's original optimization
``basin'' to maintain generalization. Consequently, GPLQ employs a sequential
``activation-first, weights-later'' strategy. Stage 1 keeps weights in FP32
while quantizing activations with a feature mimicking loss in only 1 epoch to
keep it stay in the same ``basin'', thereby preserving generalization. Stage 2
quantizes weights using a PTQ method. As a result, GPLQ is 100x faster than
existing QAT methods, lowers memory footprint to levels even below FP32
training, and achieves 4-bit model performance that is highly competitive with
FP32 models in terms of both accuracy on ImageNet and generalization to diverse
downstream tasks, including fine-grained visual classification and object
detection. We will release an easy-to-use open-source toolkit supporting
multiple vision tasks.

TL;DR: 本文对视觉语言翻译（VLT）进行了系统性研究，从数据质量、模型架构和评估指标三个角度分析现有方法的局限性，并提出改进方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在多语言和视觉理解方面表现出色，但其在VLT任务上的性能缺乏系统性评估和理解。

Method: 研究包括构建高质量数据集AibTrans，评估11种商业和6种开源模型，并提出Density-Aware Evaluation（DA Score）作为更可靠的翻译质量指标。

Result: 发现高资源语言对的微调会损害跨语言性能，并提出平衡多语言微调策略以提升模型适应性。

Conclusion: 通过改进数据集、评估方法和微调策略，为VLT任务建立了新的评估基准。

Abstract: Vision-Language Translation (VLT) is a challenging task that requires
accurately recognizing multilingual text embedded in images and translating it
into the target language with the support of visual context. While recent Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated strong multilingual and visual
understanding capabilities, there is a lack of systematic evaluation and
understanding of their performance on VLT. In this work, we present a
comprehensive study of VLT from three key perspectives: data quality, model
architecture, and evaluation metrics. (1) We identify critical limitations in
existing datasets, particularly in semantic and cultural fidelity, and
introduce AibTrans -- a multilingual, parallel, human-verified dataset with
OCR-corrected annotations. (2) We benchmark 11 commercial LVLMs/LLMs and 6
state-of-the-art open-source models across end-to-end and cascaded
architectures, revealing their OCR dependency and contrasting generation versus
reasoning behaviors. (3) We propose Density-Aware Evaluation to address metric
reliability issues under varying contextual complexity, introducing the DA
Score as a more robust measure of translation quality. Building upon these
findings, we establish a new evaluation benchmark for VLT. Notably, we observe
that fine-tuning LVLMs on high-resource language pairs degrades cross-lingual
performance, and we propose a balanced multilingual fine-tuning strategy that
effectively adapts LVLMs to VLT without sacrificing their generalization
ability.

Motivation: 自动驾驶中，摄像头成本低且普及，但现有3D检测依赖昂贵的LiDAR数据。

Method: 利用2D CNN处理点云数据，专注于所有道路使用者，而非仅车辆。

Result: 在KITTI基准测试中表现与现有图像方法相当，但运行时间仅为三分之一。

Conclusion: 该方法为低成本3D检测提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Image-based 3D object detection is an inevitable part of autonomous driving
because cheap onboard cameras are already available in most modern cars.
Because of the accurate depth information, currently, most state-of-the-art 3D
object detectors heavily rely on LiDAR data. In this paper, we propose a
pipeline which lifts the results of existing vision-based 2D algorithms to 3D
detections using only cameras as a cost-effective alternative to LiDAR. In
contrast to existing approaches, we focus not only on cars but on all types of
road users. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first using a 2D CNN to
process the point cloud for each 2D detection to keep the computational effort
as low as possible. Our evaluation on the challenging KITTI 3D object detection
benchmark shows results comparable to state-of-the-art image-based approaches
while having a runtime of only a third.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全景图像编辑由于球面几何和投影变形存在边界不连续性、轨迹变形和像素密度不均的挑战，现有方法表现不足。

Method: SphereDrag采用自适应重投影（AR）处理边界不连续性，大圆轨迹调整（GCTA）提高轨迹精度，球形搜索区域跟踪（SSRT）解决像素密度不均问题。

Result: SphereDrag在几何一致性和图像质量上显著优于现有方法，相对改进达10.5%。

Conclusion: SphereDrag通过球面几何知识实现了准确可控的全景图像编辑，并构建了PanoBench作为标准化评估框架。

Abstract: Image editing has made great progress on planar images, but panoramic image
editing remains underexplored. Due to their spherical geometry and projection
distortions, panoramic images present three key challenges: boundary
discontinuity, trajectory deformation, and uneven pixel density. To tackle
these issues, we propose SphereDrag, a novel panoramic editing framework
utilizing spherical geometry knowledge for accurate and controllable editing.
Specifically, adaptive reprojection (AR) uses adaptive spherical rotation to
deal with discontinuity; great-circle trajectory adjustment (GCTA) tracks the
movement trajectory more accurate; spherical search region tracking (SSRT)
adaptively scales the search range based on spherical location to address
uneven pixel density. Also, we construct PanoBench, a panoramic editing
benchmark, including complex editing tasks involving multiple objects and
diverse styles, which provides a standardized evaluation framework. Experiments
show that SphereDrag gains a considerable improvement compared with existing
methods in geometric consistency and image quality, achieving up to 10.5%
relative improvement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR图像中的船舶实例分割对海事监控、环境分析和国家安全至关重要，但现有方法常忽略尺度变化、目标密度和模糊边界等问题。

Method: 提出O2Former框架，包含优化查询生成器（OQG）和方向感知嵌入模块（OAEM），分别用于多尺度特征交互和方向敏感性增强。

Result: 实验表明O2Former在SAR船舶数据集上优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: O2Former通过改进特征对齐和细节捕捉能力，有效解决了SAR图像中的船舶实例分割挑战。

Abstract: Instance segmentation of ships in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is
critical for applications such as maritime monitoring, environmental analysis,
and national security. SAR ship images present challenges including scale
variation, object density, and fuzzy target boundary, which are often
overlooked in existing methods, leading to suboptimal performance. In this
work, we propose O2Former, a tailored instance segmentation framework that
extends Mask2Former by fully leveraging the structural characteristics of SAR
imagery. We introduce two key components. The first is the Optimized Query
Generator(OQG). It enables multi-scale feature interaction by jointly encoding
shallow positional cues and high-level semantic information. This improves
query quality and convergence efficiency. The second component is the
Orientation-Aware Embedding Module(OAEM). It enhances directional sensitivity
through direction-aware convolution and polar-coordinate encoding. This
effectively addresses the challenge of uneven target orientations in SAR
scenes. Together, these modules facilitate precise feature alignment from
backbone to decoder and strengthen the model's capacity to capture fine-grained
structural details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that O2Former outperforms
state of the art instance segmentation baselines, validating its effectiveness
and generalization on SAR ship datasets.

Conclusion: 该方法在多任务协同下实现了几何稳健的图像合成和明确的几何预测。

Abstract: We introduce a diffusion-based framework that performs aligned novel view
image and geometry generation via a warping-and-inpainting methodology. Unlike
prior methods that require dense posed images or pose-embedded generative
models limited to in-domain views, our method leverages off-the-shelf geometry
predictors to predict partial geometries viewed from reference images, and
formulates novel-view synthesis as an inpainting task for both image and
geometry. To ensure accurate alignment between generated images and geometry,
we propose cross-modal attention distillation, where attention maps from the
image diffusion branch are injected into a parallel geometry diffusion branch
during both training and inference. This multi-task approach achieves
synergistic effects, facilitating geometrically robust image synthesis as well
as well-defined geometry prediction. We further introduce proximity-based mesh
conditioning to integrate depth and normal cues, interpolating between point
cloud and filtering erroneously predicted geometry from influencing the
generation process. Empirically, our method achieves high-fidelity
extrapolative view synthesis on both image and geometry across a range of
unseen scenes, delivers competitive reconstruction quality under interpolation
settings, and produces geometrically aligned colored point clouds for
comprehensive 3D completion. Project page is available at

Result: 深度学习模型的平均误差为17.76毫米，略高于Tobii Pro Nano的16.53毫米。深度学习方法对光照、视力矫正和年龄等因素更敏感，在低光条件下、戴眼镜者和老年组中失败率较高。

Conclusion: 基于外观的方法在移动眼动追踪中具有潜力，并为评估不同使用条件下的注视估计系统提供了参考框架。

Abstract: This study evaluates a smartphone-based, deep-learning eye-tracking algorithm
by comparing its performance against a commercial infrared-based eye tracker,
the Tobii Pro Nano. The aim is to investigate the feasibility of
appearance-based gaze estimation under realistic mobile usage conditions. Key
sensitivity factors, including age, gender, vision correction, lighting
conditions, device type, and head position, were systematically analysed. The
appearance-based algorithm integrates a lightweight convolutional neural
network (MobileNet-V3) with a recurrent structure (Long Short-Term Memory) to
predict gaze coordinates from grayscale facial images. Gaze data were collected
from 51 participants using dynamic visual stimuli, and accuracy was measured
using Euclidean distance. The deep learning model produced a mean error of
17.76 mm, compared to 16.53 mm for the Tobii Pro Nano. While overall accuracy
differences were small, the deep learning-based method was more sensitive to
factors such as lighting, vision correction, and age, with higher failure rates
observed under low-light conditions among participants using glasses and in
older age groups. Device-specific and positional factors also influenced
tracking performance. These results highlight the potential of appearance-based
approaches for mobile eye tracking and offer a reference framework for
evaluating gaze estimation systems across varied usage conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解视觉语言模型（VLMs）如何实现视觉与语言表征的对齐，现有机制尚不明确。

Method: 冻结大型语言模型（LLM）和视觉变换器（ViT），仅通过训练线性适配器进行视觉指令调整。

Result: 通过分析稀疏自编码器（SAEs），发现视觉表征在LLM的中后层逐渐与语言表征对齐，早期层存在不匹配。

Conclusion: 当前基于适配器的架构可能未最优支持跨模态表征学习，需进一步探讨。

Abstract: Effective multimodal reasoning depends on the alignment of visual and
linguistic representations, yet the mechanisms by which vision-language models
(VLMs) achieve this alignment remain poorly understood. We introduce a
methodological framework that deliberately maintains a frozen large language
model (LLM) and a frozen vision transformer (ViT), connected solely by training
a linear adapter during visual instruction tuning. This design is fundamental
to our approach: by keeping the language model frozen, we ensure it maintains
its original language representations without adaptation to visual data.
Consequently, the linear adapter must map visual features directly into the
LLM's existing representational space rather than allowing the language model
to develop specialized visual understanding through fine-tuning. Our
experimental design uniquely enables the use of pre-trained sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) of the LLM as analytical probes. These SAEs remain perfectly aligned
with the unchanged language model and serve as a snapshot of the learned
language feature-representations. Through systematic analysis of SAE
reconstruction error, sparsity patterns, and feature SAE descriptions, we
reveal the layer-wise progression through which visual representations
gradually align with language feature representations, converging in
middle-to-later layers. This suggests a fundamental misalignment between ViT
outputs and early LLM layers, raising important questions about whether current
adapter-based architectures optimally facilitate cross-modal representation
learning.

Abstract: Test-time scaling offers a promising way to improve the reasoning performance
of vision-language large models (VLLMs) without additional training. In this
paper, we explore a simple but effective approach for applying test-time
scaling to radiology report generation. Specifically, we introduce a
lightweight Thought Graph Traversal (TGT) framework that guides the model to
reason through organ-specific findings in a medically coherent order. This
framework integrates structured medical priors into the prompt, enabling deeper
and more logical analysis with no changes to the underlying model. To further
enhance reasoning depth, we apply a reasoning budget forcing strategy that
adjusts the model's inference depth at test time by dynamically extending its
generation process. This simple yet powerful combination allows a frozen
radiology VLLM to self-correct and generate more accurate, consistent chest
X-ray reports. Our method outperforms baseline prompting approaches on standard
benchmarks, and also reveals dataset biases through traceable reasoning paths.

Result: 在LLaVA-NeXT-7B基线模型上，VGR在多模态基准测试中表现优异，仅使用30%的图像标记数，在MMStar、AI2D和ChartQA上分别提升4.1、7.1和12.9分。

Conclusion: VGR通过结合视觉定位和语言推理，显著提升了多模态CoT推理能力，尤其在需要图像细节理解的复杂任务中表现突出。

Abstract: In the field of multimodal chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, existing
approaches predominantly rely on reasoning on pure language space, which
inherently suffers from language bias and is largely confined to math or
science domains. This narrow focus limits their ability to handle complex
visual reasoning tasks that demand comprehensive understanding of image
details. To address these limitations, this paper introduces VGR, a novel
reasoning multimodal large language model (MLLM) with enhanced fine-grained
visual perception capabilities. Unlike traditional MLLMs that answer the
question or reasoning solely on the language space, our VGR first detects
relevant regions that may help to solve problems, and then provides precise
answers based on replayed image regions. To achieve this, we conduct a
large-scale SFT dataset called VGR -SFT that contains reasoning data with mixed
vision grounding and language deduction. The inference pipeline of VGR allows
the model to choose bounding boxes for visual reference and a replay stage is
introduced to integrates the corresponding regions into the reasoning process,
enhancing multimodel comprehension. Experiments on the LLaVA-NeXT-7B baseline
show that VGR achieves superior performance on multi-modal benchmarks requiring
comprehensive image detail understanding. Compared to the baseline, VGR uses
only 30\% of the image token count while delivering scores of +4.1 on MMStar,
+7.1 on AI2D, and a +12.9 improvement on ChartQA.

Motivation: 探讨身体组成指标对术后结果的预测能力，以优化术前风险评估。

Method: 使用Cox比例风险模型和逻辑回归，评估300多个CT提取特征（如肌肉面积、脂肪面积等）对1年死亡率和术后并发症的预测性能。

Result: 通过C指数和综合Brier评分评估预测性能，同时分析术后并发症、再入院等次要结果。

Conclusion: 术前CT提取的身体组成指标可能对结肠切除术后结果有预测价值，需进一步验证。

Abstract: Objective: To evaluate whether preoperative body composition metrics
automatically extracted from CT scans can predict postoperative outcomes after
colectomy, either alone or combined with clinical variables or existing risk
predictors. Main outcomes and measures: The primary outcome was the predictive
performance for 1-year all-cause mortality following colectomy. A Cox
proportional hazards model with 1-year follow-up was used, and performance was
evaluated using the concordance index (C-index) and Integrated Brier Score
(IBS). Secondary outcomes included postoperative complications, unplanned
readmission, blood transfusion, and severe infection, assessed using AUC and
Brier Score from logistic regression. Odds ratios (OR) described associations
between individual CT-derived body composition metrics and outcomes. Over 300
features were extracted from preoperative CTs across multiple vertebral levels,
including skeletal muscle area, density, fat areas, and inter-tissue metrics.
NSQIP scores were available for all surgeries after 2012.

Abstract: Affordance grounding-localizing object regions based on natural language
descriptions of interactions-is a critical challenge for enabling intelligent
agents to understand and interact with their environments. However, this task
remains challenging due to the need for fine-grained part-level localization,
the ambiguity arising from multiple valid interaction regions, and the scarcity
of large-scale datasets. In this work, we introduce Affogato, a large-scale
benchmark comprising 150K instances, annotated with open-vocabulary text
descriptions and corresponding 3D affordance heatmaps across a diverse set of
objects and interactions. Building on this benchmark, we develop simple yet
effective vision-language models that leverage pretrained part-aware vision
backbones and a text-conditional heatmap decoder. Our models trained with the
Affogato dataset achieve promising performance on the existing 2D and 3D
benchmarks, and notably, exhibit effectiveness in open-vocabulary cross-domain
generalization. The Affogato dataset is shared in public:

TL;DR: INRs的性能和适用性研究显示，简单正则化网格在多数任务中表现优于INRs，但INRs在低维结构信号中表现更佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究INRs的基本能力、隐式偏差和扩展行为，以填补当前理解的空白。

Method: 通过多样化的INRs在2D/3D信号（包括真实和合成信号）上进行实验，涵盖过拟合和泛化任务（如断层扫描、超分辨率和去噪）。

Result: 大多数任务中，正则化网格比相同参数量的INRs表现更好；INRs在低维结构信号（如形状轮廓）中表现更优。

Conclusion: INRs在特定低维结构信号中具有优势，未来应针对性应用；代码和信号数据已开源。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have recently shown impressive
results, but their fundamental capacity, implicit biases, and scaling behavior
remain poorly understood. We investigate the performance of diverse INRs across
a suite of 2D and 3D real and synthetic signals with varying effective
bandwidth, as well as both overfitting and generalization tasks including
tomography, super-resolution, and denoising. By stratifying performance
according to model size as well as signal type and bandwidth, our results shed
light on how different INR and grid representations allocate their capacity. We
find that, for most tasks and signals, a simple regularized grid with
interpolation trains faster and to higher quality than any INR with the same
number of parameters. We also find limited settings where INRs outperform grids
-- namely fitting signals with underlying lower-dimensional structure such as
shape contours -- to guide future use of INRs towards the most advantageous
applications. Code and synthetic signals used in our analysis are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期和精确诊断AD对干预和治疗至关重要，但现有方法多依赖单模态数据，无法处理多模态或缺失输入。

Method: ADAgent结合推理引擎、专业医疗工具和协作结果协调器，支持多模态诊断和预后任务。

Result: 实验显示ADAgent在多模态诊断、预后及MRI和PET诊断任务中性能显著提升。

Conclusion: ADAgent为AD分析提供了首个专用AI代理，支持多模态输入和决策，性能优越。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and irreversible neurodegenerative
disease. Early and precise diagnosis of AD is crucial for timely intervention
and treatment planning to alleviate the progressive neurodegeneration. However,
most existing methods rely on single-modality data, which contrasts with the
multifaceted approach used by medical experts. While some deep learning
approaches process multi-modal data, they are limited to specific tasks with a
small set of input modalities and cannot handle arbitrary combinations. This
highlights the need for a system that can address diverse AD-related tasks,
process multi-modal or missing input, and integrate multiple advanced methods
for improved performance. In this paper, we propose ADAgent, the first
specialized AI agent for AD analysis, built on a large language model (LLM) to
address user queries and support decision-making. ADAgent integrates a
reasoning engine, specialized medical tools, and a collaborative outcome
coordinator to facilitate multi-modal diagnosis and prognosis tasks in AD.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that ADAgent outperforms SOTA methods,
achieving significant improvements in accuracy, including a 2.7% increase in
multi-modal diagnosis, a 0.7% improvement in multi-modal prognosis, and
enhancements in MRI and PET diagnosis tasks.

TL;DR: VeTTA框架通过两阶段Transformer自编码器学习3D血管网络的向量表示，降低GPU内存需求，实现高保真重建和拓扑一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D卷积模型在建模树状几何数据时内存需求高，且难以保持拓扑一致性，需要一种更高效且精确的方法。

Method: 采用两阶段Transformer自编码器：第一阶段（Vessel Autoencoder）学习血管段的几何细节，第二阶段（Vessel Tree Autoencoder）编码血管网络拓扑。递归解码确保树结构有效性。

Result: 在2D合成树和3D冠状动脉数据集上表现优异，重建保真度高，拓扑准确，潜在空间插值真实。

Conclusion: VeTTA框架为医学影像中的树状结构提供了精确、灵活且拓扑一致的建模方法。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for learning vector representations of
tree-structured geometric data focusing on 3D vascular networks. Our approach
employs two sequentially trained Transformer-based autoencoders. In the first
stage, the Vessel Autoencoder captures continuous geometric details of
individual vessel segments by learning embeddings from sampled points along
each curve. In the second stage, the Vessel Tree Autoencoder encodes the
topology of the vascular network as a single vector representation, leveraging
the segment-level embeddings from the first model. A recursive decoding process
ensures that the reconstructed topology is a valid tree structure. Compared to
3D convolutional models, this proposed approach substantially lowers GPU memory
requirements, facilitating large-scale training. Experimental results on a 2D
synthetic tree dataset and a 3D coronary artery dataset demonstrate superior
reconstruction fidelity, accurate topology preservation, and realistic
interpolations in latent space. Our scalable framework, named VeTTA, offers
precise, flexible, and topologically consistent modeling of anatomical tree
structures in medical imaging.

TL;DR: DiffPR通过两阶段频率解耦框架解决深度学习中过平滑问题，取消高频跳跃连接并利用扩散模型恢复高频细节，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习在离轴定量相位成像（QPI）中因频谱偏差导致的过平滑问题，尤其是U-Net对低频内容的偏好和高频细节的缺失。

Method: 提出DiffPR框架：第一阶段使用不对称U-Net取消高频跳跃连接预测低分辨率相位图；第二阶段通过无条件扩散模型恢复高频细节。

Result: 在四个QPI数据集上，DiffPR优于U-Net基线，PSNR提升1.1 dB，MAE降低11%，细节更清晰。

Conclusion: 取消高频跳跃连接并利用扩散模型合成细节是解决频谱偏差的有效方法。

Abstract: Oversmoothing remains a persistent problem when applying deep learning to
off-axis quantitative phase imaging (QPI). End-to-end U-Nets favour
low-frequency content and under-represent fine, diagnostic detail. We trace
this issue to spectral bias and show that the bias is reinforced by high-level
skip connections that feed high-frequency features directly into the decoder.
Removing those deepest skips thus supervising the network only at a low
resolution significantly improves generalisation and fidelity. Building on this
insight, we introduce DiffPR, a two-stage frequency-decoupled framework. Stage
1: an asymmetric U-Net with cancelled high-frequency skips predicts a
quarter-scale phase map from the interferogram, capturing reliable
low-frequency structure while avoiding spectral bias. Stage 2: the upsampled
prediction, lightly perturbed with Gaussian noise, is refined by an
unconditional diffusion model that iteratively recovers the missing
high-frequency residuals through reverse denoising. Experiments on four QPI
datasets (B-Cell, WBC, HeLa, 3T3) show that DiffPR outperforms strong U-Net
baselines, boosting PSNR by up to 1.1 dB and reducing MAE by 11 percent, while
delivering markedly sharper membrane ridges and speckle patterns. The results
demonstrate that cancelling high-level skips and delegating detail synthesis to
a diffusion prior is an effective remedy for the spectral bias that limits
conventional phase-retrieval networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在高噪声环境（如冷冻电镜图像）中效果有限，但传统分类平均方法利用图像冗余信息有效去噪。

Method: 设计了一种基于Transformer的神经网络架构，结合聚类、对齐和去噪功能。

Result: 在合成数据上，相对均方误差比单图像DNN降低了45%（SNR为0.03时）。

Conclusion: 该方法在高噪声环境下表现优异，为冷冻电镜图像处理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Deep neural networks~(DNNs) have proven powerful for denoising, but they are
ultimately of limited use in high-noise settings, such as for cryogenic
electron microscopy~(cryo-EM) projection images. In this setting, however,
datasets contain a large number of projections of the same molecule, each taken
from a different viewing direction. This redundancy of information is useful in
traditional denoising techniques known as class averaging methods, where images
are clustered, aligned, and then averaged to reduce the noise level. We present
a neural network architecture based on transformers that extends these class
averaging methods by simultaneously clustering, aligning, and denoising cryo-EM
images. Results on synthetic data show accurate denoising performance using
this architecture, reducing the relative mean squared error (MSE) single-image
DNNs by $45\%$ at a signal-to-noise (SNR) of $0.03$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 癫痫患者需要同时评估脑结构和代谢，但FDG PET的辐射剂量对年轻患者不利。研究旨在探索生成AI方法（如扩散模型）在MRI到PET图像转换中的应用。

Method: 使用52名受试者的同步PET/MRI数据，比较了两种扩散模型（SGM-KD和SGM-VP）和Transformer-Unet在MRI到PET转换任务中的表现。

Result: SGM-KD在纯MRI输入时表现最佳；加入1%低剂量PET后，所有模型性能显著提升且表现相当。

Conclusion: 扩散模型在纯MRI到PET转换中潜力巨大，而所有模型在结合低剂量PET时均能准确合成全剂量FDG-PET图像。

Abstract: Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET to evaluate patients with epilepsy is one of the
most common applications for simultaneous PET/MRI, given the need to image both
brain structure and metabolism, but is suboptimal due to the radiation dose in
this young population. Little work has been done synthesizing diagnostic
quality PET images from MRI data or MRI data with ultralow-dose PET using
advanced generative AI methods, such as diffusion models, with attention to
clinical evaluations tailored for the epilepsy population. Here we compared the
performance of diffusion- and non-diffusion-based deep learning models for the
MRI-to-PET image translation task for epilepsy imaging using simultaneous
PET/MRI in 52 subjects (40 train/2 validate/10 hold-out test). We tested three
different models: 2 score-based generative diffusion models (SGM-Karras
Diffusion [SGM-KD] and SGM-variance preserving [SGM-VP]) and a
Transformer-Unet. We report results on standard image processing metrics as
well as clinically relevant metrics, including congruency measures (Congruence
Index and Congruency Mean Absolute Error) that assess hemispheric metabolic
asymmetry, which is a key part of the clinical analysis of these images. The
SGM-KD produced the best qualitative and quantitative results when synthesizing
PET purely from T1w and T2 FLAIR images with the least mean absolute error in
whole-brain specific uptake value ratio (SUVR) and highest intraclass
correlation coefficient. When 1% low-dose PET images are included in the
inputs, all models improve significantly and are interchangeable for
quantitative performance and visual quality. In summary, SGMs hold great
potential for pure MRI-to-PET translation, while all 3 model types can
synthesize full-dose FDG-PET accurately using MRI and ultralow-dose PET.

Conclusion: HERCULES技术展示了在有限窗口下实现大体积成像的潜力，适用于器官和组织的3D可视化。

Abstract: Top-Orthogonal-to-Bottom-Electrode (TOBE) arrays, also known as
bias-switchable row-column arrays (RCAs), allow for imaging techniques
otherwise impossible for non-bias-switachable RCAs. Hadamard Encoded Row Column
Ultrasonic Expansive Scanning (HERCULES) is a novel imaging technique that
allows for expansive 3D scanning by transmitting plane or cylindrical
wavefronts and receiving using Hadamard-Encoded-Read-Out (HERO) to perform
beamforming on what is effectively a full 2D synthetic receive aperture. This
allows imaging beyond the shadow of the aperture of the RCA array, potentially
allows for whole organ imaging and 3D visualization of tissue morphology. It
additionally enables view large volumes through limited windows. In this work
we demonstrated with simulation that we are able to image at comparable
resolution to existing RCA imaging methods at hundreds of frames per second. We
validated these simulations by demonstrating an experimental implementation of
HERCULES using a custom fabricated TOBE array, custom biasing electronics, and
a research ultrasound system. Furthermore, we assess our imaging capabilities
by imaging a commercial phantom, and comparing our results to those taken with
traditional RCA imaging methods. Finally, we verified our ability to image real
tissue by imaging a xenograft mouse model.

Abstract: Background: Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains one of the leading causes
of mortality worldwide. Precise segmentation of coronary arteries from invasive
coronary angiography (ICA) is critical for effective clinical decision-making.
Objective: This study aims to propose a novel deep learning model based on
frequency-domain analysis to enhance the accuracy of coronary artery
segmentation and stenosis detection in ICA, thereby offering robust support for
the stenosis detection and treatment of CAD. Methods: We propose the
Frequency-Domain Attention-Guided Diffusion Network (FAD-Net), which integrates
a frequency-domain-based attention mechanism and a cascading diffusion strategy
to fully exploit frequency-domain information for improved segmentation
accuracy. Specifically, FAD-Net employs a Multi-Level Self-Attention (MLSA)
mechanism in the frequency domain, computing the similarity between queries and
keys across high- and low-frequency components in ICAs. Furthermore, a
Low-Frequency Diffusion Module (LFDM) is incorporated to decompose ICAs into
low- and high-frequency components via multi-level wavelet transformation.
Subsequently, it refines fine-grained arterial branches and edges by
reintegrating high-frequency details via inverse fusion, enabling continuous
enhancement of anatomical precision. Results and Conclusions: Extensive
experiments demonstrate that FAD-Net achieves a mean Dice coefficient of 0.8717
in coronary artery segmentation, outperforming existing state-of-the-art
methods. In addition, it attains a true positive rate of 0.6140 and a positive
predictive value of 0.6398 in stenosis detection, underscoring its clinical
applicability. These findings suggest that FAD-Net holds significant potential
to assist in the accurate diagnosis and treatment planning of CAD.

Conclusion: 该方法为高分辨率CT成像提供了一种有效解决方案，代码将公开。

Abstract: High-resolution computed tomography (CT) imaging is essential for medical
diagnosis but requires increased radiation exposure, creating a critical
trade-off between image quality and patient safety. While deep learning methods
have shown promise in CT super-resolution, they face challenges with complex
degradations and limited medical training data. Meanwhile, large-scale
pre-trained diffusion models, particularly Stable Diffusion, have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in synthesizing fine details across various vision
tasks. Motivated by this, we propose a novel framework that adapts Stable
Diffusion for CT blind super-resolution. We employ a practical degradation
model to synthesize realistic low-quality images and leverage a pre-trained
vision-language model to generate corresponding descriptions. Subsequently, we
perform super-resolution using Stable Diffusion with a specialized controlling
strategy, conditioned on both low-resolution inputs and the generated text
descriptions. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing
approaches, demonstrating its potential for achieving high-quality CT imaging
at reduced radiation doses. Our code will be made publicly available.

Result: 实验表明，该方法性能与或优于SOTA模型，同时显著减少推理时间。

Conclusion: 为解决压缩视频超分辨率的关键瓶颈提供了高效实用的解决方案。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) compressed video super-resolution (CVSR) models face
persistent challenges, including prolonged inference time, complex training
pipelines, and reliance on auxiliary information. As video frame rates continue
to increase, the diminishing inter-frame differences further expose the
limitations of traditional frame-to-frame information exploitation methods,
which are inadequate for addressing current video super-resolution (VSR)
demands. To overcome these challenges, we propose an efficient and scalable
solution inspired by the structural and statistical similarities between
hyperspectral images (HSI) and video data. Our approach introduces a
compression-driven dimensionality reduction strategy that reduces computational
complexity, accelerates inference, and enhances the extraction of temporal
information across frames. The proposed modular architecture is designed for
seamless integration with existing VSR frameworks, ensuring strong adaptability
and transferability across diverse applications. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method achieves performance on par with, or surpassing,
the current SOTA models, while significantly reducing inference time. By
addressing key bottlenecks in CVSR, our work offers a practical and efficient
pathway for advancing VSR technology. Our code will be publicly available at

Abstract: Functional brain network analysis has become an indispensable tool for brain
disease analysis. It is profoundly impacted by deep learning methods, which can
characterize complex connections between ROIs. However, the research on
foundation models of brain network is limited and constrained to a single
dimension, which restricts their extensive application in neuroscience. In this
study, we propose a fine-tuned brain network model for brain disease diagnosis.
It expands brain region representations across multiple dimensions based on the
original brain network model, thereby enhancing its generalizability. Our model
consists of two key modules: (1)an adapter module that expands brain region
features across different dimensions. (2)a fine-tuned foundation brain network
model, based on self-supervised learning and pre-trained on fMRI data from
thousands of participants. Specifically, its transformer block is able to
effectively extract brain region features and compute the inter-region
associations. Moreover, we derive a compact latent representation of the brain
network for brain disease diagnosis. Our downstream experiments in this study
demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior performance in brain
disease diagnosis, which potentially offers a promising approach in brain
network analysis research.

Abstract: The adoption of neural network models in medical imaging has been constrained
by strict privacy regulations, limited data availability, high acquisition
costs, and demographic biases. Deep generative models offer a promising
solution by generating synthetic data that bypasses privacy concerns and
addresses fairness by producing samples for under-represented groups. However,
unlike natural images, medical imaging requires validation not only for
fidelity (e.g., Fr\'echet Inception Score) but also for morphological and
clinical accuracy. This is particularly true for colour fundus retinal imaging,
which requires precise replication of the retinal vascular network, including
vessel topology, continuity, and thickness. In this study, we in-vestigated
whether a distance-based loss function based on deep activation layers of a
large foundational model trained on large corpus of domain data, colour fundus
imaging, offers advantages over a perceptual loss and edge-detection based loss
functions. Our extensive validation pipeline, based on both domain-free and
domain specific tasks, suggests that domain-specific deep features do not
improve autoen-coder image generation. Conversely, our findings highlight the
effectiveness of con-ventional edge detection filters in improving the
sharpness of vascular structures in synthetic samples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肌肉骨骼疾病（MSDs）是全球致残的主要原因，需要先进的诊断和治疗工具以实现个性化评估和治疗。

Method: MS-DT结合运动捕捉、超声成像、肌电图和医学影像，创建患者特定的肌肉骨骼系统模型，并通过交互式可视化平台分析脊柱运动学、姿势和肌肉功能。

Abstract: Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are a leading cause of disability worldwide,
requiring advanced diagnostic and therapeutic tools for personalised assessment
and treatment. Effective management of MSDs involves the interaction of
heterogeneous data sources, making the Digital Twin (DT) paradigm a valuable
option. This paper introduces the Musculoskeletal Digital Twin (MS-DT), a novel
framework that integrates multiscale biomechanical data with computational
modelling to create a detailed, patient-specific representation of the
musculoskeletal system. By combining motion capture, ultrasound imaging,
electromyography, and medical imaging, the MS-DT enables the analysis of spinal
kinematics, posture, and muscle function. An interactive visualisation platform
provides clinicians and researchers with an intuitive interface for exploring
biomechanical parameters and tracking patient-specific changes. Results
demonstrate the effectiveness of MS-DT in extracting precise kinematic and
dynamic tissue features, offering a comprehensive tool for monitoring spine
biomechanics and rehabilitation. This framework provides high-fidelity
modelling and real-time visualization to improve patient-specific diagnosis and
intervention planning.

*Zhangkai Ni,Yang Zhang,Wenhan Yang,Hanli Wang,Shiqi Wang,Sam Kwong*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于结构相似性展开的高效图像超分辨率方法（SSIU），结合数据驱动和模型驱动的优势，通过展开优化函数设计模块，实现高性能且紧凑的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动的超分辨率方法通过增加模型深度或使用注意力机制扩展感受野，但导致模型复杂度高；模型驱动方法通过展开范式在保持紧凑性的同时提升性能。

Method: 提出SSIU方法，通过展开结构相似性约束的优化函数设计模块，包括混合尺度门控模块（MSGM）和高效稀疏注意力模块（ESAM），并设计基于专家混合的特征选择器（MoE-FS）。

Result: 模型在性能上优于当前最优方法，同时参数更少、内存消耗更低。

Conclusion: SSIU方法有效结合了数据驱动和模型驱动的优势，实现了高效且高性能的图像超分辨率。

Abstract: Major efforts in data-driven image super-resolution (SR) primarily focus on
expanding the receptive field of the model to better capture contextual
information. However, these methods are typically implemented by stacking
deeper networks or leveraging transformer-based attention mechanisms, which
consequently increases model complexity. In contrast, model-driven methods
based on the unfolding paradigm show promise in improving performance while
effectively maintaining model compactness through sophisticated module design.
Based on these insights, we propose a Structural Similarity-Inspired Unfolding
(SSIU) method for efficient image SR. This method is designed through unfolding
an SR optimization function constrained by structural similarity, aiming to
combine the strengths of both data-driven and model-driven approaches. Our
model operates progressively following the unfolding paradigm. Each iteration
consists of multiple Mixed-Scale Gating Modules (MSGM) and an Efficient Sparse
Attention Module (ESAM). The former implements comprehensive constraints on
features, including a structural similarity constraint, while the latter aims
to achieve sparse activation. In addition, we design a Mixture-of-Experts-based
Feature Selector (MoE-FS) that fully utilizes multi-level feature information
by combining features from different steps. Extensive experiments validate the
efficacy and efficiency of our unfolding-inspired network. Our model
outperforms current state-of-the-art models, boasting lower parameter counts
and reduced memory consumption. Our code will be available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 皮肤分割在医学图像分析中至关重要，支持诊断和治疗规划。研究旨在比较不同方法，为选择策略提供依据。

Method: 比较了迭代区域生长算法和基于深度学习的TotalSegmentator，测试了不同成像模态和解剖区域。

Result: AI分割在自动化方面表现优异，但MRI表现较差；图形方法在MRI上更优但噪声较多。AI还能自动去除CT中的患者床。

Conclusion: 选择皮肤分割方法需根据数据可用性和应用需求，AI适合自动化场景，图形方法适合MRI。

Abstract: Automatic segmentation of anatomical structures is critical in medical image
analysis, aiding diagnostics and treatment planning. Skin segmentation plays a
key role in registering and visualising multimodal imaging data. 3D skin
segmentation enables applications in personalised medicine, surgical planning,
and remote monitoring, offering realistic patient models for treatment
simulation, procedural visualisation, and continuous condition tracking. This
paper analyses and compares algorithmic and AI-driven skin segmentation
approaches, emphasising key factors to consider when selecting a strategy based
on data availability and application requirements. We evaluate an iterative
region-growing algorithm and the TotalSegmentator, a deep learning-based
approach, across different imaging modalities and anatomical regions. Our tests
show that AI segmentation excels in automation but struggles with MRI due to
its CT-based training, while the graphics-based method performs better for MRIs
but introduces more noise. AI-driven segmentation also automates patient bed
removal in CT, whereas the graphics-based method requires manual intervention.

TL;DR: MindGrab是一种参数和内存高效的深度学习模型，用于多模态头图像的颅骨剥离，性能优于传统方法，且资源需求低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种高效且适用于多模态头图像的颅骨剥离模型，以解决现有方法在资源需求和性能上的不足。

Method: 基于频谱解释的扩张卷积架构，仅使用模态无关的合成数据进行训练。

Result: 在606例多模态脑扫描数据上，MindGrab的平均Dice得分为95.9，显著优于ROBEX和BET，与SynthStrip性能相当或更优，同时参数减少95%，推理速度更快。

Conclusion: MindGrab在保持高性能的同时显著降低了资源需求，适用于更广泛的硬件环境。

Abstract: We developed MindGrab, a parameter- and memory-efficient deep
fully-convolutional model for volumetric skull-stripping in head images of any
modality. Its architecture, informed by a spectral interpretation of dilated
convolutions, was trained exclusively on modality-agnostic synthetic data.
MindGrab was evaluated on a retrospective dataset of 606 multimodal adult-brain
scans (T1, T2, DWI, MRA, PDw MRI, EPI, CT, PET) sourced from the SynthStrip
dataset. Performance was benchmarked against SynthStrip, ROBEX, and BET using
Dice scores, with Wilcoxon signed-rank significance tests. MindGrab achieved a
mean Dice score of 95.9 with standard deviation (SD) 1.6 across modalities,
significantly outperforming classical methods (ROBEX: 89.1 SD 7.7, P < 0.05;
BET: 85.2 SD 14.4, P < 0.05). Compared to SynthStrip (96.5 SD 1.1, P=0.0352),
MindGrab delivered equivalent or superior performance in nearly half of the
tested scenarios, with minor differences (<3% Dice) in the others. MindGrab
utilized 95% fewer parameters (146,237 vs. 2,566,561) than SynthStrip. This
efficiency yielded at least 2x faster inference, 50% lower memory usage on
GPUs, and enabled exceptional performance (e.g., 10-30x speedup, and up to 30x
memory reduction) and accessibility on a wider range of hardware, including
systems without high-end GPUs. MindGrab delivers state-of-the-art accuracy with
dramatically lower resource demands, supported in brainchop-cli
(https://pypi.org/project/brainchop/) and at brainchop.org.

TL;DR: 论文分析了跨模态域适应挑战（crossMoDA）的演变，从2021年到2023年，重点关注无监督跨模态分割任务，并展示了数据集扩展和多样性对性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过跨模态分割任务（从ceT1到T2 MRI）为临床提供更经济的前庭神经鞘瘤（VS）管理方案，并作为领域适应的基准。

Method: 利用多机构数据和不断增加的复杂性（如Koos分级、肿瘤子分割）进行挑战赛，并对历年数据进行分析。

Result: 数据集扩展减少了异常值，但2023年由于肿瘤子注释的复杂性，耳蜗分割性能下降。2023年的获胜方法在早期测试数据上表现更好。

Conclusion: 尽管VS分割仍需改进，但性能趋于平稳，未来可能需要更具挑战性的跨模态任务作为基准。

Abstract: The cross-Modality Domain Adaptation (crossMoDA) challenge series, initiated
in 2021 in conjunction with the International Conference on Medical Image
Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI), focuses on unsupervised
cross-modality segmentation, learning from contrast-enhanced T1 (ceT1) and
transferring to T2 MRI. The task is an extreme example of domain shift chosen
to serve as a meaningful and illustrative benchmark. From a clinical
application perspective, it aims to automate Vestibular Schwannoma (VS) and
cochlea segmentation on T2 scans for more cost-effective VS management. Over
time, the challenge objectives have evolved to enhance its clinical relevance.
The challenge evolved from using single-institutional data and basic
segmentation in 2021 to incorporating multi-institutional data and Koos grading
in 2022, and by 2023, it included heterogeneous routine data and
sub-segmentation of intra- and extra-meatal tumour components. In this work, we
report the findings of the 2022 and 2023 editions and perform a retrospective
analysis of the challenge progression over the years. The observations from the
successive challenge contributions indicate that the number of outliers
decreases with an expanding dataset. This is notable since the diversity of
scanning protocols of the datasets concurrently increased. The winning approach
of the 2023 edition reduced the number of outliers on the 2021 and 2022 testing
data, demonstrating how increased data heterogeneity can enhance segmentation
performance even on homogeneous data. However, the cochlea Dice score declined
in 2023, likely due to the added complexity from tumour sub-annotations
affecting overall segmentation performance. While progress is still needed for
clinically acceptable VS segmentation, the plateauing performance suggests that
a more challenging cross-modal task may better serve future benchmarking.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: AA-2DGS是一种改进的2D高斯泼溅方法，通过引入世界空间平滑核和对象空间Mip滤波器，解决了2DGS在不同采样率下的锯齿问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 2DGS在训练和渲染采样率不一致时会出现严重锯齿，限制了其在相机缩放或变视角场景中的应用。

Method: 提出AA-2DGS，引入世界空间平滑核约束频率内容，并设计对象空间Mip滤波器进行局部抗锯齿。

Result: AA-2DGS显著提升了渲染质量，消除了高频锯齿，同时保留了2DGS的几何优势。

Conclusion: AA-2DGS有效解决了2DGS的锯齿问题，扩展了其在实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) has recently emerged as a promising method for
novel view synthesis and surface reconstruction, offering better
view-consistency and geometric accuracy than volumetric 3DGS. However, 2DGS
suffers from severe aliasing artifacts when rendering at different sampling
rates than those used during training, limiting its practical applications in
scenarios requiring camera zoom or varying fields of view. We identify that
these artifacts stem from two key limitations: the lack of frequency
constraints in the representation and an ineffective screen-space clamping
approach. To address these issues, we present AA-2DGS, an antialiased
formulation of 2D Gaussian Splatting that maintains its geometric benefits
while significantly enhancing rendering quality across different scales. Our
method introduces a world space flat smoothing kernel that constrains the
frequency content of 2D Gaussian primitives based on the maximal sampling
frequency from training views, effectively eliminating high-frequency artifacts
when zooming in. Additionally, we derive a novel object space Mip filter by
leveraging an affine approximation of the ray-splat intersection mapping, which
allows us to efficiently apply proper anti-aliasing directly in the local space
of each splat.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升GPU射线追踪的性能，尤其是对二次射线的处理效率。

Method: 提出一种基于终止点估计的射线重排序方法，适用于二次射线追踪，并在RTX内核中进行评估。

Result: 射线重排序显著提升追踪速度（1.3-2.0倍），但硬件加速阶段的排序开销难以完全抵消。

Conclusion: 射线重排序有效但需进一步优化以平衡排序开销与性能提升。

Abstract: We study ray reordering as a tool for increasing the performance of existing
GPU ray tracing implementations. We focus on ray reordering that is fully
agnostic to the particular trace kernel. We summarize the existing methods for
computing the ray sorting keys and discuss their properties. We propose a novel
modification of a previously proposed method using the termination point
estimation that is well-suited to tracing secondary rays. We evaluate the ray
reordering techniques in the context of the wavefront path tracing using the
RTX trace kernels. We show that ray reordering yields significantly higher
trace speed on recent GPUs (1.3-2.0x), but to recover the reordering overhead
in the hardware-accelerated trace phase is problematic.

Result: GPU实现性能比常规网格提升高达30倍，支持实时渲染32样本/像素的生产级资产。

Conclusion: 四面体网格在体积数据渲染中具有显著优势，适合高性能GPU实现。

Abstract: We advertise the use of tetrahedral grids constructed via the longest edge
bisection algorithm for rendering volumetric data with path tracing. The key
benefits of such grids is two-fold. First, they provide a highly adaptive
space-partitioning representation that limits the memory footprint of
volumetric assets. Second, each (tetrahedral) cell has exactly 4 neighbors
within the volume (one per face of each tetrahedron) or less at boundaries. We
leverage these properties to devise optimized algorithms and data-structures to
compute and path-trace adaptive tetrahedral grids on the GPU. In practice, our
GPU implementation outperforms regular grids by up to x30 and renders
production assets in real time at 32 samples per pixel.

Motivation: 现有数据集主要研究自然视频和传统失真，而合成内容和现代渲染失真的感知研究不足。

Method: 构建了一个包含多种渲染技术失真的视频质量数据集，并基于预训练的3D CNN特征空间提出了CGVQM指标。

Result: 现有全参考质量指标在这些失真上表现不佳（最高Pearson相关性0.78），CGVQM显著优于现有指标。

Conclusion: CGVQM在合成内容质量评估中表现优异，数据集和指标已开源。

Abstract: While existing video and image quality datasets have extensively studied
natural videos and traditional distortions, the perception of synthetic content
and modern rendering artifacts remains underexplored. We present a novel video
quality dataset focused on distortions introduced by advanced rendering
techniques, including neural supersampling, novel-view synthesis, path tracing,
neural denoising, frame interpolation, and variable rate shading. Our
evaluations show that existing full-reference quality metrics perform
sub-optimally on these distortions, with a maximum Pearson correlation of 0.78.
Additionally, we find that the feature space of pre-trained 3D CNNs aligns
strongly with human perception of visual quality. We propose CGVQM, a
full-reference video quality metric that significantly outperforms existing
metrics while generating both per-pixel error maps and global quality scores.

Abstract: Seismology has entered the petabyte era, driven by decades of continuous
recordings of broadband networks, the increase in nodal seismic experiments,
and the recent emergence of Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS). This review
explains how commercial clouds - AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure - by providing
object storage, elastic compute, and managed databases, enable researchers to
"bring the code to the data," thereby overcoming traditional HPC solutions'
bandwidth and capacity limitations. After literature reviews of cloud concepts
and their research applications in seismology, we illustrate the capacities of
cloud-native workflows using two canonical end-to-end demonstrations: 1)
ambient noise seismology and cross-correlation, and 2) earthquake detection,
discrimination, and phase picking. Both workflows utilized S3 for streaming I/O
and DocumentDB for provenance, demonstrating that cloud throughput can rival
on-premises HPC at comparable costs, scanning 100 TBs to 1.3 PBs of seismic
data in a few hours or days of processing. The review also discusses research
and education initiatives, the reproducibility benefits of containers, and cost
pitfalls (e.g., egress, I/O fees) of energy-intensive seismological research
computing. While designing cloud pipelines remains non-trivial, partnerships
with research software engineers enable converting domain code into scalable,
automated, and environmentally conscious solutions for next-generation
seismology.

Motivation: 传统地震反射率反演依赖已知地震子波，而实际地震数据中子波的时空变化难以准确获取，因此需要一种不依赖子波提取的反演方法。

Method: 采用多尺度傅里叶变换，通过不同窗口长度分析地震道，实现稀疏反射率反演，无需子波提取、初始模型或井控数据。

Result: 反演结果与合成和实际数据的测井带限阻抗高度吻合。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于块状阻抗结构的地层，可直接应用于深度偏移数据，具有无需子波提取的优势。

Abstract: The Multiscale Fourier Transform of a seismic trace performs time-frequency
analyses over a range of window lengths. The variation in window length
captures local and global relative amplitudes between events, thereby allowing
reflectivity inversion that is independent of the amplitude spectrum of the
seismic wavelet. As the temporal and spatial variation of the actual seismic
wavelet in seismic reflection data is poorly known, this approach has many
advantages over conventional seismic reflectivity inversion. No wavelet
extraction is performed. Thus, the inversion for reflectivity can be conducted
without well control, seismic ties, or time-depth functions. The inversion is
sparse, so no starting model is needed. Furthermore, as no wavelet is required,
the inversion can be applied directly to depth migrated data. The phase of the
wavelet is constrained by the assumption of sparse reflectivity and thus works
best when earth impedance structure is blocky. Trace integration of the
inverted reflectivity provides bandlimited impedance which compares very
favorably to well-log bandlimited impedance for both synthetic and real data
cases.

Motivation: 研究全球森林地上碳（AGC）的长期动态及其碳汇-源转变，以解决因干扰机制变化和观测方法不一致带来的不确定性。

Method: 通过整合多源卫星观测数据和概率深度学习模型，估算高空间分辨率的全球森林AGC及其不确定性。

Result: 全球森林30年间为6.2 PgC的碳汇，但热带湿润森林和北方森林在2011-2021年间转变为碳源；巴西亚马逊未受干扰区域的碳损失贡献显著增加。

Conclusion: 热带森林AGC在调节陆地碳循环中的作用增强，人为气候变化可能对未受干扰区域的AGC变化影响日益显著。

Abstract: As enduring carbon sinks, forest ecosystems are vital to the terrestrial
carbon cycle and help moderate global warming. However, the long-term dynamics
of aboveground carbon (AGC) in forests and their sink-source transitions remain
highly uncertain, owing to changing disturbance regimes and inconsistencies in
observations, data processing, and analysis methods. Here, we derive reliable,
harmonized AGC stocks and fluxes in global forests from 1988 to 2021 at high
spatial resolution by integrating multi-source satellite observations with
probabilistic deep learning models. Our approach simultaneously estimates AGC
and associated uncertainties, showing high reliability across space and time.
We find that, although global forests remained an AGC sink of 6.2 PgC over 30
years, moist tropical forests shifted to a substantial AGC source between 2001
and 2010 and, together with boreal forests, transitioned toward a source in the
2011-2021 period. Temperate, dry tropical and subtropical forests generally
exhibited increasing AGC stocks, although Europe and Australia became sources
after 2011. Regionally, pronounced sink-to-source transitions occurred in
tropical forests over the past three decades. The interannual relationship
between global atmospheric CO2 growth rates and tropical AGC flux variability
became increasingly negative, reaching Pearson's r = -0.63 (p < 0.05) in the
most recent decade. In the Brazilian Amazon, the contribution of deforested
regions to AGC losses declined from 60% in 1989-2000 to 13% in 2011-2021, while
the share from untouched areas increased from 33% to 76%. Our findings suggest
a growing role of tropical forest AGC in modulating variability in the
terrestrial carbon cycle, with anthropogenic climate change potentially
contributing increasingly to AGC changes, particularly in previously untouched
areas.

Abstract: Research on lane change prediction has gained a lot of momentum in the last
couple of years. However, most research is confined to simulation or results
obtained from datasets, leaving a gap between algorithmic advances and on-road
deployment. This work closes that gap by demonstrating, on real hardware, a
lane-change prediction system based on Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGEs) and
Bayesian inference. Moreover, the ego-vehicle employs a longitudinal braking
action to ensure the safety of both itself and the surrounding vehicles. Our
architecture consists of two modules: (i) a perception module that senses the
environment, derives input numerical features, and converts them into
linguistic categories; and communicates them to the prediction module; (ii) a
pretrained prediction module that executes a KGE and Bayesian inference model
to anticipate the target vehicle's maneuver and transforms the prediction into
longitudinal braking action. Real-world hardware experimental validation
demonstrates that our prediction system anticipates the target vehicle's lane
change three to four seconds in advance, providing the ego vehicle sufficient
time to react and allowing the target vehicle to make the lane change safely.

TL;DR: SAE-BrainMap框架通过稀疏自编码器（SAE）将深度学习视觉模型表示与fMRI体素级响应直接对齐，揭示了模型与人类视觉皮层的层次映射关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在建立深度学习模型与人类视觉皮层之间的直接联系，以增强模型的可解释性。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器（SAE）对模型激活进行分层训练，计算SAE单元激活与fMRI信号的余弦相似度，构建体素字典并分析功能结构。

Result: SAE单元与fMRI信号的最大相似度达0.76，ViT-B/16$_{CLIP}$模型在早期层利用低级信息生成高级语义信息。

Conclusion: SAE-BrainMap为深度学习模型与人类视觉皮层之间提供了无下游任务的直接桥梁，为模型可解释性提供了新视角。

Abstract: We present SAE-BrainMap, a novel framework that directly aligns deep learning
visual model representations with voxel-level fMRI responses using sparse
autoencoders (SAEs). First, we train layer-wise SAEs on model activations and
compute the correlations between SAE unit activations and cortical fMRI signals
elicited by the same natural image stimuli with cosine similarity, revealing
strong activation correspondence (maximum similarity up to 0.76). Depending on
this alignment, we construct a voxel dictionary by optimally assigning the most
similar SAE feature to each voxel, demonstrating that SAE units preserve the
functional structure of predefined regions of interest (ROIs) and exhibit
ROI-consistent selectivity. Finally, we establish fine-grained hierarchical
mapping between model layers and the human ventral visual pathway, also by
projecting voxel dictionary activations onto individual cortical surfaces, we
visualize the dynamic transformation of the visual information in deep learning
models. It is found that ViT-B/16$_{CLIP}$ tends to utilize low-level
information to generate high-level semantic information in the early layers and
reconstructs the low-dimension information later. Our results establish a
direct, downstream-task-free bridge between deep neural networks and human
visual cortex, offering new insights into model interpretability.

TL;DR: 利用4D Swin Transformer和卷积解码器预测未来人脑静息状态，模型在HCP数据上表现高精度，预测结果与BOLD信号高度相似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解脑动态对神经科学和心理健康至关重要，fMRI提供了一种测量脑状态的方法，但如何高效预测未来脑状态仍需探索。

Method: 提出一种新架构，结合4D Swin Transformer编码器和卷积解码器，学习fMRI数据的时空信息，并保持输入分辨率。

Result: 模型在预测7.2秒静息态脑活动时表现高精度，预测结果与BOLD信号动态高度相似。

Conclusion: 研究表明Swin Transformer能高效学习人脑时空组织，为减少fMRI扫描时间和开发脑机接口提供潜力。

Abstract: Understanding brain dynamics is important for neuroscience and mental health.
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) enables the measurement of neural
activities through blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals, which represent
brain states. In this study, we aim to predict future human resting brain
states with fMRI. Due to the 3D voxel-wise spatial organization and temporal
dependencies of the fMRI data, we propose a novel architecture which employs a
4D Shifted Window (Swin) Transformer as encoder to efficiently learn
spatio-temporal information and a convolutional decoder to enable brain state
prediction at the same spatial and temporal resolution as the input fMRI data.
We used 100 unrelated subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) for
model training and testing. Our novel model has shown high accuracy when
predicting 7.2s resting-state brain activities based on the prior 23.04s fMRI
time series. The predicted brain states highly resemble BOLD contrast and
dynamics. This work shows promising evidence that the spatiotemporal
organization of the human brain can be learned by a Swin Transformer model, at
high resolution, which provides a potential for reducing the fMRI scan time and
the development of brain-computer interfaces in the future.

Method: 使用时间均匀的有理逼近矩阵指数，通过部分分式分解设计快速并行求解器。

Result: 并行求解的线性系统数量与时间通道数和空间离散化无关，具有高并行效率。

Conclusion: 该方法在正演和反演瞬变电磁问题中均能实现高效并行计算。

Abstract: A new approach for the parallel forward modeling of transient electromagnetic
(TEM) fields is presented. It is based on a family of uniform-in-time rational
approximants to the matrix exponential that share a common denominator
independent of the evaluation time points. The partial fraction decomposition
of this family is exploited to devise a fast solver with high parallel
efficiency. The number of shifted linear systems that need to be solved in
parallel does not depend on the number of required time channels nor the
spatial discretization. We also argue that similar parallel efficiency gains
can be expected when solving the inverse TEM problem.

Motivation: ECG信号常受噪声干扰，影响临床和可穿戴设备的诊断准确性，现有方法存在标注不一致和泛化性差的问题。

Method: 采用扩散模型框架，利用Wasserstein-1距离（$W_1$）比较干净和噪声ECG的重建误差分布，仅需三步反向扩散实现噪声量化。

Result: 模型在基准测试中宏平均$W_1$得分为1.308，优于次优方法48%以上，外部验证显示强泛化性。

Conclusion: 该方法提升了临床决策、诊断准确性和实时ECG监测能力，支持未来临床和可穿戴ECG应用的发展。

Abstract: Electrocardiography (ECG) signals are often degraded by noise, which
complicates diagnosis in clinical and wearable settings. This study proposes a
diffusion-based framework for ECG noise quantification via reconstruction-based
anomaly detection, addressing annotation inconsistencies and the limited
generalizability of conventional methods. We introduce a distributional
evaluation using the Wasserstein-1 distance ($W_1$), comparing the
reconstruction error distributions between clean and noisy ECGs to mitigate
inconsistent annotations. Our final model achieved robust noise quantification
using only three reverse diffusion steps. The model recorded a macro-average
$W_1$ score of 1.308 across the benchmarks, outperforming the next-best method
by over 48%. External validations demonstrated strong generalizability,
supporting the exclusion of low-quality segments to enhance diagnostic accuracy
and enable timely clinical responses to signal degradation. The proposed method
enhances clinical decision-making, diagnostic accuracy, and real-time ECG
monitoring capabilities, supporting future advancements in clinical and
wearable ECG applications.

Conclusion: VLT预训练和轻量级RL微调是实现鲁棒自动驾驶的有效方法。

Abstract: We present Poutine, a 3B-parameter vision-language model (VLM) tailored for
end-to-end autonomous driving in long-tail driving scenarios. Poutine is
trained in two stages. To obtain strong base driving capabilities, we train
Poutine-Base in a self-supervised vision-language-trajectory (VLT) next-token
prediction fashion on 83 hours of CoVLA nominal driving and 11 hours of Waymo
long-tail driving. Accompanying language annotations are auto-generated with a
72B-parameter VLM. Poutine is obtained by fine-tuning Poutine-Base with Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using less than 500 preference-labeled
frames from the Waymo validation set. We show that both VLT pretraining and RL
fine-tuning are critical to attain strong driving performance in the long-tail.
Poutine-Base achieves a rater-feedback score (RFS) of 8.12 on the validation
set, nearly matching Waymo's expert ground-truth RFS. The final Poutine model
achieves an RFS of 7.99 on the official Waymo test set, placing 1st in the 2025

Conclusion: Gondola通过多视角输入和对象定位优化，显著提升了机器人操作的泛化能力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Robotic manipulation faces a significant challenge in generalizing across
unseen objects, environments and tasks specified by diverse language
instructions. To improve generalization capabilities, recent research has
incorporated large language models (LLMs) for planning and action execution.
While promising, these methods often fall short in generating grounded plans in
visual environments. Although efforts have been made to perform visual
instructional tuning on LLMs for robotic manipulation, existing methods are
typically constrained by single-view image input and struggle with precise
object grounding. In this work, we introduce Gondola, a novel grounded
vision-language planning model based on LLMs for generalizable robotic
manipulation. Gondola takes multi-view images and history plans to produce the
next action plan with interleaved texts and segmentation masks of target
objects and locations. To support the training of Gondola, we construct three
types of datasets using the RLBench simulator, namely robot grounded planning,
multi-view referring expression and pseudo long-horizon task datasets. Gondola
outperforms the state-of-the-art LLM-based method across all four
generalization levels of the GemBench dataset, including novel placements,
rigid objects, articulated objects and long-horizon tasks.

Motivation: 人类在微尺度制造中仍优于机器人，但机器人可通过控制算法和相机位置优化减少不确定性。

Method: 提出多机器人控制系统模拟定位过程，并设计相机移动策略以寻找噪声最小的最优位置。

Result: 多机器人控制系统显著减少不确定性，相机位置优化算法有效降低图像噪声。

Conclusion: 控制算法和相机位置优化是减少制造业中不确定性的有效且经济的方法。

Abstract: The use of robotic technology has drastically increased in manufacturing in
the 21st century. But by utilizing their sensory cues, humans still outperform
machines, especially in micro scale manufacturing, which requires
high-precision robot manipulators. These sensory cues naturally compensate for
high levels of uncertainties that exist in the manufacturing environment.
Uncertainties in performing manufacturing tasks may come from measurement
noise, model inaccuracy, joint compliance (e.g., elasticity), etc. Although
advanced metrology sensors and high precision microprocessors, which are
utilized in modern robots, have compensated for many structural and dynamic
errors in robot positioning, a well-designed control algorithm still works as a
comparable and cheaper alternative to reduce uncertainties in automated
manufacturing. Our work illustrates that a multi-robot control system that
simulates the positioning process for fastening and unfastening applications
can reduce various uncertainties, which may occur in this process, to a great
extent. In addition, most research papers in visual servoing mainly focus on
developing control and observation architectures in various scenarios, but few
have discussed the importance of the camera's location in the configuration. In
a manufacturing environment, the quality of camera estimations may vary
significantly from one observation location to another, as the combined effects
of environmental conditions result in different noise levels of a single image
shot at different locations. Therefore, in this paper, we also propose a novel
algorithm for the camera's moving policy so that it explores the camera
workspace and searches for the optimal location where the image noise level is
minimized.

Abstract: Dyslexia, affecting an estimated 10% to 20% of the global population,
significantly impairs learning capabilities, highlighting the need for
innovative and accessible diagnostic methods. This paper investigates the
effectiveness of eye-tracking technology combined with machine learning
algorithms as a cost-effective alternative for early dyslexia detection. By
analyzing general eye movement patterns, including prolonged fixation durations
and erratic saccades, we proposed an enhanced solution for determining
eye-tracking-based dyslexia features. A Random Forest Classifier was then
employed to detect dyslexia, achieving an accuracy of 88.58\%. Additionally,
hierarchical clustering methods were applied to identify varying severity
levels of dyslexia. The analysis incorporates diverse methodologies across
various populations and settings, demonstrating the potential of this
technology to identify individuals with dyslexia, including those with
borderline traits, through non-invasive means. Integrating eye-tracking with
machine learning represents a significant advancement in the diagnostic
process, offering a highly accurate and accessible method in clinical research.

Motivation: 传统深度学习的几何相似性模型与人类心理感知不符，而Tversky的基于特征的相似性理论未被应用于深度学习。

Method: 开发了可微分的Tversky相似性参数化方法，并设计了Tversky投影层，通过梯度下降学习。

Result: 在NABirds图像分类任务中，Tversky投影层相对线性层提升了24.7%的准确率；GPT-2的困惑度降低了7.5%，参数减少了34.8%。

Conclusion: Tversky投影层为深度学习提供了一种新的相似性模型，同时提高了模型的解释性。

Abstract: Work in psychology has highlighted that the geometric model of similarity
standard in deep learning is not psychologically plausible because its metric
properties such as symmetry do not align with human perception. In contrast,
Tversky (1977) proposed an axiomatic theory of similarity based on a
representation of objects as sets of features, and their similarity as a
function of common and distinctive features. However, this model has not been
used in deep learning before, partly due to the challenge of incorporating
discrete set operations. We develop a differentiable parameterization of
Tversky's similarity that is learnable through gradient descent, and derive
neural network building blocks such as the Tversky projection layer, which
unlike the linear projection layer can model non-linear functions such as XOR.
Through experiments with image recognition and language modeling, we show that
the Tversky projection layer is a beneficial replacement for the linear
projection layer, which employs geometric similarity. On the NABirds image
classification task, a frozen ResNet-50 adapted with a Tversky projection layer
achieves a 24.7% relative accuracy improvement over the linear layer adapter
baseline. With Tversky projection layers, GPT-2's perplexity on PTB decreases
by 7.5%, and its parameter count by 34.8%. Finally, we propose a unified
interpretation of both projection layers as computing similarities of input
stimuli to learned prototypes, for which we also propose a novel visualization
technique highlighting the interpretability of Tversky projection layers. Our
work offers a new paradigm for thinking about the similarity model implicit in
deep learning, and designing networks that are interpretable under an
established theory of psychological similarity.

Motivation: 多模态学习中，动态融合策略（如注意力机制）常因模型偏好某一模态而失效，导致动态适应性下降。

Method: 提出RollingQ方法，通过旋转查询平衡注意力分配，打破自强化循环并缩小键分布差距。

Result: 实验验证RollingQ在多模态场景中的有效性，恢复了合作动态。

Conclusion: RollingQ能有效增强多模态Transformer的动态适应性，提升其广泛能力。

Abstract: Multimodal learning faces challenges in effectively fusing information from
diverse modalities, especially when modality quality varies across samples.
Dynamic fusion strategies, such as attention mechanism in Transformers, aim to
address such challenge by adaptively emphasizing modalities based on the
characteristics of input data. However, through amounts of carefully designed
experiments, we surprisingly observed that the dynamic adaptability of
widely-used self-attention models diminishes. Model tends to prefer one
modality regardless of data characteristics. This bias triggers a
self-reinforcing cycle that progressively overemphasizes the favored modality,
widening the distribution gap in attention keys across modalities and
deactivating attention mechanism's dynamic properties. To revive adaptability,
we propose a simple yet effective method Rolling Query (RollingQ), which
balances attention allocation by rotating the query to break the
self-reinforcing cycle and mitigate the key distribution gap. Extensive
experiments on various multimodal scenarios validate the effectiveness of
RollingQ and the restoration of cooperation dynamics is pivotal for enhancing
the broader capabilities of widely deployed multimodal Transformers. The source
code is available at https://github.com/GeWu-Lab/RollingQ_ICML2025.

Motivation: 观察到自监督图像预训练方法与强化学习中的价值函数学习有相似性，希望通过强化学习框架改进无标签图像数据的特征学习。

Conclusion: 通过强化学习框架，可以更灵活地利用无标签图像数据改进特征学习，尤其在存在弱标签或精选图像时效果更佳。

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), value-based algorithms learn to associate
each observation with the states and rewards that are likely to be reached from
it. We observe that many self-supervised image pre-training methods bear
similarity to this formulation: learning features that associate crops of
images with those of nearby views, e.g., by taking a different crop or color
augmentation. In this paper, we complete this analogy and explore a method that
directly casts pre-training on unlabeled image data like web crawls and video
frames as an RL problem. We train a general value function in a dynamical
system where an agent transforms an image by changing the view or adding image
augmentations. Learning in this way resembles crop-consistency
self-supervision, but through the reward function, offers a simple lever to
shape feature learning using curated images or weakly labeled captions when
they exist. Our experiments demonstrate improved representations when training
on unlabeled images in the wild, including video data like EpicKitchens, scene
data like COCO, and web-crawl data like CC12M.

Conclusion: 领域适应技术可提升神经代理模型的泛化能力，但在工业场景中仍需解决分布偏移的鲁棒性问题。

Abstract: Neural surrogates for Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) often suffer
significant performance degradation when evaluated on unseen problem
configurations, such as novel material types or structural dimensions.
Meanwhile, Domain Adaptation (DA) techniques have been widely used in vision
and language processing to generalize from limited information about unseen
configurations. In this work, we address this gap through two focused
contributions. First, we introduce SIMSHIFT, a novel benchmark dataset and
evaluation suite composed of four industrial simulation tasks: hot rolling,
sheet metal forming, electric motor design and heatsink design. Second, we
extend established domain adaptation methods to state of the art neural
surrogates and systematically evaluate them. These approaches use parametric
descriptions and ground truth simulations from multiple source configurations,
together with only parametric descriptions from target configurations. The goal
is to accurately predict target simulations without access to ground truth
simulation data. Extensive experiments on SIMSHIFT highlight the challenges of
out of distribution neural surrogate modeling, demonstrate the potential of DA
in simulation, and reveal open problems in achieving robust neural surrogates
under distribution shifts in industrially relevant scenarios. Our codebase is

TL;DR: EMLoC是一种基于模拟器的内存高效微调框架，通过LoRA校正，实现在推理相同内存预算下的模型微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源基础模型虽强大，但针对特定领域或个性化任务的微调因内存开销大而成本高昂。

Method: 使用激活感知SVD构建轻量级模拟器，通过LoRA微调，并提出补偿算法校正LoRA模块。

Result: 实验表明EMLoC在多个数据集和模态上优于基线，支持单24GB GPU微调38B模型。

Conclusion: EMLoC为个体用户提供了高效实用的模型适配方案。

Abstract: Open-source foundation models have seen rapid adoption and development,
enabling powerful general-purpose capabilities across diverse domains. However,
fine-tuning large foundation models for domain-specific or personalized tasks
remains prohibitively expensive for most users due to the significant memory
overhead beyond that of inference. We introduce EMLoC, an Emulator-based
Memory-efficient fine-tuning framework with LoRA Correction, which enables
model fine-tuning within the same memory budget required for inference. EMLoC
constructs a task-specific light-weight emulator using activation-aware
singular value decomposition (SVD) on a small downstream calibration set.
Fine-tuning then is performed on this lightweight emulator via LoRA. To tackle
the misalignment between the original model and the compressed emulator, we
propose a novel compensation algorithm to correct the fine-tuned LoRA module,
which thus can be merged into the original model for inference. EMLoC supports
flexible compression ratios and standard training pipelines, making it
adaptable to a wide range of applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that EMLoC outperforms other baselines across multiple datasets and modalities.
Moreover, without quantization, EMLoC enables fine-tuning of a 38B model on a
single 24GB consumer GPU-bringing efficient and practical model adaptation to
individual users.

Abstract: Deep learning vision systems excel at pattern recognition yet falter when
inputs are noisy or the model must explain its own confidence. Fuzzy inference,
with its graded memberships and rule transparency, offers a remedy, while
parameterized quantum circuits can embed features in richly entangled Hilbert
spaces with striking parameter efficiency. Bridging these ideas, this study
introduces a innovative Highly Quantized Fuzzy Neural Network (HQFNN) that
realises the entire fuzzy pipeline inside a shallow quantum circuit and couples
the resulting quantum signal to a lightweight CNN feature extractor. Each image
feature is first mapped to a single qubit membership state through repeated
angle reuploading. Then a compact rule layer refines these amplitudes, and a
clustered CNOT defuzzifier collapses them into one crisp value that is fused
with classical features before classification. Evaluated on standard image
benchmarks, HQFNN consistently surpasses classical, fuzzy enhanced and quantum
only baselines while using several orders of magnitude fewer trainable weights,
and its accuracy degrades only marginally under simulated depolarizing and
amplitude damping noise, evidence of intrinsic robustness. Gate count analysis
further shows that circuit depth grows sublinearly with input dimension,
confirming the model's practicality for larger images. These results position
the model as a compact, interpretable and noise tolerant alternative to
conventional vision backbones and provide a template for future quantum native
fuzzy learning frameworks.

TL;DR: CLAIM是一种无需额外训练的方法，通过调整跨语言注意力模式来减少多语言对象幻觉问题，显著提升了多语言场景下的视觉感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在多语言查询中容易产生与视觉输入不一致的响应，现有方法依赖资源密集的预训练或微调。

Method: CLAIM通过识别语言特定的跨模态注意力头，估计语言偏移向量，并在推理时干预注意力输出。

Result: 实验显示CLAIM在POPE和MME基准上平均提升了13.56%和21.75%，西班牙语最高提升30%。

Conclusion: CLAIM有效缓解了多语言对象幻觉问题，中间层的注意力差异在多语言场景中尤为关键。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive multimodal
abilities but remain prone to multilingual object hallucination, with a higher
likelihood of generating responses inconsistent with the visual input when
utilizing queries in non-English languages compared to English. Most existing
approaches to address these rely on pretraining or fine-tuning, which are
resource-intensive. In this paper, inspired by observing the disparities in
cross-modal attention patterns across languages, we propose Cross-Lingual
Attention Intervention for Mitigating multilingual object hallucination (CLAIM)
in LVLMs, a novel near training-free method by aligning attention patterns.
CLAIM first identifies language-specific cross-modal attention heads, then
estimates language shift vectors from English to the target language, and
finally intervenes in the attention outputs during inference to facilitate
cross-lingual visual perception capability alignment. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that CLAIM achieves an average improvement of 13.56% (up to 30% in
Spanish) on the POPE and 21.75% on the hallucination subsets of the MME
benchmark across various languages. Further analysis reveals that multilingual
attention divergence is most prominent in intermediate layers, highlighting
their critical role in multilingual scenarios.

Conclusion: 该工具箱适用于算法开发和实验重建，可与其他同步辐射或X射线自由电子激光仪器集成。

Abstract: We present a Python toolbox for holographic and tomographic X-ray imaging. It
comprises a collection of phase retrieval algorithms for the deeply holographic
and direct contrast imaging regimes, including non-linear approaches and
extended choices of regularization, constraint sets, and optimizers, all
implemented with a unified and intuitive interface. Moreover, it features
auxiliary functions for (tomographic) alignment, image processing, and
simulation of imaging experiments. The capability of the toolbox is illustrated
by the example of a catalytic nanoparticle, imaged in the deeply holographic
regime at the 'GINIX' instrument of the P10 beamline at the PETRA III storage
ring (DESY, Hamburg). Due to its modular design, the toolbox can be used for
algorithmic development and benchmarking in a lean and flexible manner, or be
interfaced and integrated in the reconstruction pipeline of other synchrotron
or XFEL instruments for phase imaging based on propagation.

Abstract: Self-organising systems demonstrate how simple local rules can generate
complex stochastic patterns. Many natural systems rely on such dynamics, making
self-organisation central to understanding natural complexity. A fundamental
challenge in modelling such systems is solving the inverse problem: finding the
unknown causal parameters from macroscopic observations. This task becomes
particularly difficult when observations have a strong stochastic component,
yielding diverse yet equivalent patterns. Traditional inverse methods fail in
this setting, as pixel-wise metrics cannot capture feature similarities between
variable outcomes. In this work, we introduce a novel inverse modelling method
specifically designed to handle stochasticity in the observable space,
leveraging the capacity of visual embeddings to produce robust representations
that capture perceptual invariances. By mapping the pattern representations
onto an invariant embedding space, we can effectively recover unknown causal
parameters without the need for handcrafted objective functions or heuristics.
We evaluate the method on two canonical models--a reaction-diffusion system and
an agent-based model of social segregation--and show that it reliably recovers
parameters despite stochasticity in the outcomes. We further apply the method
to real biological patterns, highlighting its potential as a tool for both
theorists and experimentalists to investigate the dynamics underlying complex
stochastic pattern formation.

### [137] [Capsule: Efficient Player Isolation for Datacenters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11483)
*Zhouheng Du,Nima Davari,Li Li,Nodir Kodirov*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Capsule是一种允许多个玩家共享GPU的机制，显著提高了数据中心资源利用率，同时不影响游戏体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 云游戏日益流行，但数据中心资源利用率低，尤其是GPU资源因游戏引擎设计而未被充分利用。

Method: 在开源游戏引擎O3DE中实现Capsule，支持多玩家共享GPU，无需修改应用程序。

Result: Capsule能将数据中心资源利用率提升至多2.25倍，且不影响玩家体验。

Conclusion: Capsule设计可推广至其他游戏引擎，提升云服务提供商的资源利用率。

Abstract: Cloud gaming is increasingly popular. A challenge for cloud provider is to
keep datacenter utilization high: a non-trivial task due to application
variety. These applications come in different shapes and sizes. So do cloud
datacenter resources, e.g., CPUs, GPUs, NPUs.
  Part of the challenge stems from game engines being predominantly designed to
run only one player. One player in a lightweight game might utilize only a
fraction of the cloud server GPU. The remaining GPU capacity will be left
underutilized, an undesired outcome for the cloud provider. We introduce
Capsule, a mechanism that allows multiple players to seamlessly share one GPU.
  We implemented Capsule in O3DE, a popular open source game engine. Our
evaluations show that Capsule can increase datacenter resource utilization by
accommodating up to 2.25x more players, without degrading player gaming
experience. Capsule is also application agnostic. We ran four applications on
Capsule-based O3DE with no application changes. Our experiences show that
Capsule design can be adopted by other game engines to increase datacenter
utilization across cloud providers.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文介绍了一个新的德语视觉语言模型（VLM）评测数据集，基于中学课程内容，包含2000多个开放式问题，覆盖9个领域。评估显示现有模型整体准确率低于45%，尤其在音乐、数学和对抗性问题上表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有英语评测数据集多为脱离上下文或人为难题，缺乏真实性和多模态理解能力。本文旨在填补德语环境下结合视觉与学科知识的评测空白。

Method: 从中学课程中提取486张图片和2000多个问题，覆盖数学、历史、生物等9个领域，评估13个开源VLM模型的多维表现。

Result: 最强模型整体准确率低于45%，音乐和数学领域表现最差，对抗性问题效果不佳，显示现有评测与真实多模态理解的差距。

Conclusion: 中学任务是非英语环境下评测VLM的有效途径，数据集为未来AI系统的视觉与语言推理能力提供了严格测试基准。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel benchmark dataset designed to evaluate the
capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) on tasks that combine visual
reasoning with subject-specific background knowledge in the German language. In
contrast to widely used English-language benchmarks that often rely on
artificially difficult or decontextualized problems, this dataset draws from
real middle school curricula across nine domains including mathematics,
history, biology, and religion. The benchmark includes over 2,000 open-ended
questions grounded in 486 images, ensuring that models must integrate visual
interpretation with factual reasoning rather than rely on superficial textual
cues. We evaluate thirteen state-of-the-art open-weight VLMs across multiple
dimensions, including domain-specific accuracy and performance on adversarial
crafted questions. Our findings reveal that even the strongest models achieve
less than 45% overall accuracy, with particularly poor performance in music,
mathematics, and adversarial settings. Furthermore, the results indicate
significant discrepancies between success on popular benchmarks and real-world
multimodal understanding. We conclude that middle school-level tasks offer a
meaningful and underutilized avenue for stress-testing VLMs, especially in
non-English contexts. The dataset and evaluation protocol serve as a rigorous
testbed to better understand and improve the visual and linguistic reasoning
capabilities of future AI systems.

### [139] [GaussMarker: Robust Dual-Domain Watermark for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11444)
*Kecen Li,Zhicong Huang,Xinwen Hou,Cheng Hong*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种双域扩散模型水印方法（GaussMarker），通过在空间和频率域嵌入水印，并结合可学习的高斯噪声恢复器（GNR），显著提升了水印的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着扩散模型生成的图像越来越逼真，版权和滥用问题日益突出，现有单域水印方法鲁棒性不足。

Method: 采用双域水印方法（空间和频率域），结合GNR优化提取的高斯噪声，并通过双水印检测分数提升鲁棒性。

Result: 在多种图像失真和高级攻击下，GaussMarker在三个版本的Stable Diffusion中表现最优，召回率高且误报率低。

Conclusion: GaussMarker为扩散模型水印提供了一种高效且鲁棒的解决方案，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: As Diffusion Models (DM) generate increasingly realistic images, related
issues such as copyright and misuse have become a growing concern. Watermarking
is one of the promising solutions. Existing methods inject the watermark into
the single-domain of initial Gaussian noise for generation, which suffers from
unsatisfactory robustness. This paper presents the first dual-domain DM
watermarking approach using a pipelined injector to consistently embed
watermarks in both the spatial and frequency domains. To further boost
robustness against certain image manipulations and advanced attacks, we
introduce a model-independent learnable Gaussian Noise Restorer (GNR) to refine
Gaussian noise extracted from manipulated images and enhance detection
robustness by integrating the detection scores of both watermarks. GaussMarker
efficiently achieves state-of-the-art performance under eight image distortions
and four advanced attacks across three versions of Stable Diffusion with better
recall and lower false positive rates, as preferred in real applications.
