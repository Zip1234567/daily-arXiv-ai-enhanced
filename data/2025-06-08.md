### [1] [Dynamic Epsilon Scheduling: A Multi-Factor Adaptive Perturbation Budget for Adversarial Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04263)
*Alan Mitkiy,James Smith,Hana Satou,Hiroshi Tanaka,Emily Johnson,F Monkey*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态调整对抗训练扰动预算的方法（DES），通过结合梯度代理、预测置信度和模型不确定性，动态调整每个实例和训练迭代的扰动预算，提升了对抗鲁棒性和标准准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗训练方法依赖固定的扰动预算，未能考虑实例特定的鲁棒性特征，限制了其效果。

Method: 提出DES框架，动态调整扰动预算，结合梯度代理、预测置信度和模型不确定性。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100上，DES显著提升了对抗鲁棒性和标准准确性，优于固定预算和现有自适应方法。

Conclusion: DES为实例感知和数据驱动的对抗训练开辟了新方向，并提供了理论稳定性与收敛性分析。

Abstract: Adversarial training is among the most effective strategies for defending
deep neural networks against adversarial examples. A key limitation of existing
adversarial training approaches lies in their reliance on a fixed perturbation
budget, which fails to account for instance-specific robustness
characteristics. While prior works such as IAAT and MMA introduce
instance-level adaptations, they often rely on heuristic or static
approximations of data robustness. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Epsilon
Scheduling (DES), a novel framework that adaptively adjusts the adversarial
perturbation budget per instance and per training iteration. DES integrates
three key factors: (1) the distance to the decision boundary approximated via
gradient-based proxies, (2) prediction confidence derived from softmax entropy,
and (3) model uncertainty estimated via Monte Carlo dropout. By combining these
cues into a unified scheduling strategy, DES tailors the perturbation budget
dynamically to guide more effective adversarial learning. Experimental results
on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show that our method consistently improves both
adversarial robustness and standard accuracy compared to fixed-epsilon
baselines and prior adaptive methods. Moreover, we provide theoretical insights
into the stability and convergence of our scheduling policy. This work opens a
new avenue for instance-aware, data-driven adversarial training methods.

### [2] [RSVP: Reasoning Segmentation via Visual Prompting and Multi-modal Chain-of-Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04277)
*Yi Lu,Jiawang Cao,Yongliang Wu,Bozheng Li,Licheng Tang,Yangguang Ji,Chong Wu,Jay Wu,Wenbo Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RSVP框架通过视觉提示统一多模态推理与视觉分割，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型在视觉定位和分割上的不足，弥合认知推理与视觉感知的差距。

Method: 两阶段框架：推理阶段生成区域建议，分割阶段通过视觉语言分割模块优化分割掩码。

Result: 在ReasonSeg上提升+6.5 gIoU和+9.2 cIoU，SegInW零样本设置下达到49.7 mAP。

Conclusion: RSVP为认知推理与结构化视觉理解提供了有效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
reasoning capability while lack explicit mechanisms for visual grounding and
segmentation, creating a gap between cognitive reasoning and visual perception.
To bridge this gap, we introduce Reasoning Segmentation via Visual Prompting
(RSVP), a novel framework that unifies multi-step multimodal reasoning with
grounded visual understanding. RSVP is a two-stage structuralized framework
that integrates reasoning-driven localization with segmentation refinement. In
the reasoning stage, RSVP employs multimodal chain-of-thought visual prompts to
help MLLMs understand queries and infer targets, generating interpretable
region proposals that enhance visual grounding. In segmentation stage, RSVP
refines these proposals with a Vision-Language Segmentation Module (VLSM),
seamlessly integrates textual and visual cues to produce precise segmentation
masks. By explicitly modelling the interaction between multimodal reasoning and
segmentation, RSVP introduces a new paradigm for interpretable reasoning
segmentation. It exploits MLLMs' inherent localization capabilities, enabling
the models to not only reason about objects but also generate structured visual
representations. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RSVP achieves
state-of-the-art performance, surpasses state-of-the-art methods by up to +6.5
gIoU and +9.2 cIoU on ReasonSeg, and achieves 49.7 mAP on SegInW under
zero-shot settings. These results validate RSVP as an effective and scalable
framework for integrating cognitive reasoning with structured visual
understanding.

### [3] [Physics Informed Capsule Enhanced Variational AutoEncoder for Underwater Image Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04753)
*Niki Martinel,Rita Pucci*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的双流架构，通过结合物理模型和胶囊聚类特征学习，实现了水下图像增强的先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下图像增强需要同时考虑物理模型和语义结构，现有方法难以兼顾这两点。

Method: 采用双流架构，一个流用于物理模型估计（传输图和背景光），另一个流通过胶囊聚类提取特征。

Result: 在六个基准测试中，PSNR提升0.5dB，计算复杂度降低三分之二。

Conclusion: 该方法在物理约束和感知质量上取得了平衡，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: We present a novel dual-stream architecture that achieves state-of-the-art
underwater image enhancement by explicitly integrating the Jaffe-McGlamery
physical model with capsule clustering-based feature representation learning.
Our method simultaneously estimates transmission maps and spatially-varying
background light through a dedicated physics estimator while extracting
entity-level features via capsule clustering in a parallel stream. This
physics-guided approach enables parameter-free enhancement that respects
underwater formation constraints while preserving semantic structures and
fine-grained details. Our approach also features a novel optimization objective
ensuring both physical adherence and perceptual quality across multiple spatial
frequencies. To validate our approach, we conducted extensive experiments
across six challenging benchmarks. Results demonstrate consistent improvements
of $+0.5$dB PSNR over the best existing methods while requiring only one-third
of their computational complexity (FLOPs), or alternatively, more than $+1$dB
PSNR improvement when compared to methods with similar computational budgets.
Code and data \textit{will} be available at https://github.com/iN1k1/.

### [4] [Evaluating MLLMs with Multimodal Multi-image Reasoning Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04280)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMRB是首个评估多图像结构化视觉推理的基准，包含92个子任务，覆盖空间、时间和语义推理，并采用GPT-4o生成的CoT风格标注。实验表明开源MLLM在多图像推理任务中显著落后于商业MLLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM基准主要关注单图像推理或多图像理解任务，缺乏对多图像输入推理能力的系统评估。

Method: 提出MMRB基准，包含92个子任务，采用GPT-4o生成标注，并设计句子级匹配框架进行快速评估。

Result: 实验显示开源MLLM在多图像推理任务中表现显著落后于商业MLLM，且当前多模态奖励模型在多图像奖励排序任务中几乎无效。

Conclusion: MMRB填补了多图像推理评估的空白，揭示了开源MLLM与商业MLLM的差距，并指出了多模态奖励模型的不足。

Abstract: With enhanced capabilities and widespread applications, Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly required to process and reason over
multiple images simultaneously. However, existing MLLM benchmarks focus either
on single-image visual reasoning or on multi-image understanding tasks with
only final-answer evaluation, leaving the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs over
multi-image inputs largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce the
$\textbf{Multimodal Multi-image Reasoning Benchmark (MMRB)}$, the first
benchmark designed to evaluate structured visual reasoning across multiple
images. MMRB comprises $\textbf{92 sub-tasks}$ covering spatial, temporal, and
semantic reasoning, with multi-solution, CoT-style annotations generated by
GPT-4o and refined by human experts. A derivative subset is designed to
evaluate multimodal reward models in multi-image scenarios. To support fast and
scalable evaluation, we propose a sentence-level matching framework using
open-source LLMs. Extensive baseline experiments on $\textbf{40 MLLMs}$,
including 9 reasoning-specific models and 8 reward models, demonstrate that
open-source MLLMs still lag significantly behind commercial MLLMs in
multi-image reasoning tasks. Furthermore, current multimodal reward models are
nearly incapable of handling multi-image reward ranking tasks.

### [5] [HuGeDiff: 3D Human Generation via Diffusion with Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04351)
*Maksym Ivashechkin,Oscar Mendez,Richard Bowden*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种弱监督流程，通过图像扩散模型生成可控属性的人像数据集，并利用基于Transformer的架构将其映射到3D点云，最后训练点云扩散模型，显著提升了3D人像生成的速度、真实感和文本对齐性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D人像生成方法在细节、真实感和可控性方面存在不足，且缺乏多样性和标注数据，阻碍了基础3D人像模型的发展。

Method: 1. 使用图像扩散模型生成可控属性的人像数据集；2. 提出基于Transformer的架构将图像特征映射到3D点云；3. 训练点云扩散模型，以原始文本提示为条件。

Result: 相比现有方法，实现了数量级的速度提升，并显著改善了文本对齐性、真实感和渲染质量。

Conclusion: 提出的弱监督流程有效解决了3D人像生成的挑战，为未来研究提供了代码和数据集支持。

Abstract: 3D human generation is an important problem with a wide range of applications
in computer vision and graphics. Despite recent progress in generative AI such
as diffusion models or rendering methods like Neural Radiance Fields or
Gaussian Splatting, controlling the generation of accurate 3D humans from text
prompts remains an open challenge. Current methods struggle with fine detail,
accurate rendering of hands and faces, human realism, and controlability over
appearance. The lack of diversity, realism, and annotation in human image data
also remains a challenge, hindering the development of a foundational 3D human
model. We present a weakly supervised pipeline that tries to address these
challenges. In the first step, we generate a photorealistic human image dataset
with controllable attributes such as appearance, race, gender, etc using a
state-of-the-art image diffusion model. Next, we propose an efficient mapping
approach from image features to 3D point clouds using a transformer-based
architecture. Finally, we close the loop by training a point-cloud diffusion
model that is conditioned on the same text prompts used to generate the
original samples. We demonstrate orders-of-magnitude speed-ups in 3D human
generation compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, along with
significantly improved text-prompt alignment, realism, and rendering quality.
We will make the code and dataset available.

*Ankit Pal,Jung-Oh Lee,Xiaoman Zhang,Malaikannan Sankarasubbu,Seunghyeon Roh,Won Jung Kim,Meesun Lee,Pranav Rajpurkar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReXVQA是一个针对胸部放射学视觉问答（VQA）的最大、最全面的基准测试，包含约696,000个问题和160,000个胸部X光研究。它评估了八种多模态大语言模型，其中MedGemma表现最佳（83.24%准确率），并首次在胸部X光解读上超越人类专家（77.27%准确率）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VQA基准测试多依赖模板化查询，缺乏临床真实性。ReXVQA旨在填补这一空白，提供多样化的临床任务，评估五种核心放射学推理技能。

Method: ReXVQA构建了一个大规模数据集，包含多样化的临床问题，并评估了八种多模态大语言模型。此外，还进行了人类读者研究，比较AI与放射科医生的表现。

Result: MedGemma模型表现最佳（83.24%准确率），首次超越人类专家（77.27%准确率）。人类读者间一致性高，而AI与人类的一致性模式更复杂。

Conclusion: ReXVQA为评估通用放射学AI系统设立了新标准，为下一代AI系统奠定了基础，能够模拟专家级临床推理。数据集将开源。

Abstract: We present ReXVQA, the largest and most comprehensive benchmark for visual
question answering (VQA) in chest radiology, comprising approximately 696,000
questions paired with 160,000 chest X-rays studies across training, validation,
and test sets. Unlike prior efforts that rely heavily on template based
queries, ReXVQA introduces a diverse and clinically authentic task suite
reflecting five core radiological reasoning skills: presence assessment,
location analysis, negation detection, differential diagnosis, and geometric
reasoning. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art multimodal large language models,
including MedGemma-4B-it, Qwen2.5-VL, Janus-Pro-7B, and Eagle2-9B. The
best-performing model (MedGemma) achieves 83.24% overall accuracy. To bridge
the gap between AI performance and clinical expertise, we conducted a
comprehensive human reader study involving 3 radiology residents on 200
randomly sampled cases. Our evaluation demonstrates that MedGemma achieved
superior performance (83.84% accuracy) compared to human readers (best
radiology resident: 77.27%), representing a significant milestone where AI
performance exceeds expert human evaluation on chest X-ray interpretation. The
reader study reveals distinct performance patterns between AI models and human
experts, with strong inter-reader agreement among radiologists while showing
more variable agreement patterns between human readers and AI models. ReXVQA
establishes a new standard for evaluating generalist radiological AI systems,
offering public leaderboards, fine-grained evaluation splits, structured
explanations, and category-level breakdowns. This benchmark lays the foundation
for next-generation AI systems capable of mimicking expert-level clinical
reasoning beyond narrow pathology classification. Our dataset will be
open-sourced at https://huggingface.co/datasets/rajpurkarlab/ReXVQA

### [7] [WorldPrediction: A Benchmark for High-level World Modeling and Long-horizon Procedural Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04363)
*Delong Chen,Willy Chung,Yejin Bang,Ziwei Ji,Pascale Fung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文介绍了WorldPrediction，一个基于视频的基准测试，用于评估AI模型的世界建模和程序规划能力，强调动作的时空和语义抽象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类具有内部“世界模型”以支持行动规划，而AI代理也需要类似能力。当前AI模型（尤其是生成模型）如何学习这种能力尚不明确。

Method: 通过WorldPrediction基准测试，区分正确的动作或动作序列（基于初始和最终世界状态），避免低层连续性线索干扰。

Result: 前沿模型在WorldPrediction-WM和WorldPrediction-PP任务中准确率仅为57%和38%，而人类能完美解决。

Conclusion: WorldPrediction为评估世界建模和规划能力提供了可靠基准，揭示了当前AI与人类的差距。

Abstract: Humans are known to have an internal "world model" that enables us to carry
out action planning based on world states. AI agents need to have such a world
model for action planning as well. It is not clear how current AI models,
especially generative models, are able to learn such world models and carry out
procedural planning in diverse environments. We introduce WorldPrediction, a
video-based benchmark for evaluating world modeling and procedural planning
capabilities of different AI models. In contrast to prior benchmarks that focus
primarily on low-level world modeling and robotic motion planning,
WorldPrediction is the first benchmark that emphasizes actions with temporal
and semantic abstraction. Given initial and final world states, the task is to
distinguish the proper action (WorldPrediction-WM) or the properly ordered
sequence of actions (WorldPrediction-PP) from a set of counterfactual
distractors. This discriminative task setup enable us to evaluate different
types of world models and planners and realize a thorough comparison across
different hypothesis. The benchmark represents states and actions using visual
observations. In order to prevent models from exploiting low-level continuity
cues in background scenes, we provide "action equivalents" - identical actions
observed in different contexts - as candidates for selection. This benchmark is
grounded in a formal framework of partially observable semi-MDP, ensuring
better reliability and robustness of the evaluation. We conduct extensive human
filtering and validation on our benchmark and show that current frontier models
barely achieve 57% accuracy on WorldPrediction-WM and 38% on WorldPrediction-PP
whereas humans are able to solve both tasks perfectly.

### [8] [Ice Hockey Puck Localization Using Contextual Cues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04365)
*Liam Salass,Jerrin Bright,Amir Nazemi,Yuhao Chen,John Zelek,David Clausi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PLUCC提出了一种基于上下文线索的冰球检测方法，利用球员行为作为先验信息，显著提升了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冰球在视频中检测困难，传统方法未充分利用球员行为的上下文线索。

Method: PLUCC包含上下文编码器、特征金字塔编码器和门控解码器，结合多尺度特征和通道门控机制。

Result: 在PuckDataset上，PLUCC的平均精度提升12.2%，RSLE平均精度提升25%。

Conclusion: 上下文理解对冰球检测至关重要，对自动化体育分析有广泛意义。

Abstract: Puck detection in ice hockey broadcast videos poses significant challenges
due to the puck's small size, frequent occlusions, motion blur, broadcast
artifacts, and scale inconsistencies due to varying camera zoom and broadcast
camera viewpoints. Prior works focus on appearance-based or motion-based cues
of the puck without explicitly modelling the cues derived from player
behaviour. Players consistently turn their bodies and direct their gaze toward
the puck. Motivated by this strong contextual cue, we propose Puck Localization
Using Contextual Cues (PLUCC), a novel approach for scale-aware and
context-driven single-frame puck detections. PLUCC consists of three
components: (a) a contextual encoder, which utilizes player orientations and
positioning as helpful priors; (b) a feature pyramid encoder, which extracts
multiscale features from the dual encoders; and (c) a gating decoder that
combines latent features with a channel gating mechanism. For evaluation, in
addition to standard average precision, we propose Rink Space Localization
Error (RSLE), a scale-invariant homography-based metric for removing
perspective bias from rink space evaluation. The experimental results of PLUCC
on the PuckDataset dataset demonstrated state-of-the-art detection performance,
surpassing previous baseline methods by an average precision improvement of
12.2% and RSLE average precision of 25%. Our research demonstrates the critical
role of contextual understanding in improving puck detection performance, with
broad implications for automated sports analysis.

*Zhaoyang Lv,Maurizio Monge,Ka Chen,Yufeng Zhu,Michael Goesele,Jakob Engel,Zhao Dong,Richard Newcombe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文研究了使用自中心设备进行高动态范围场景的逼真重建的挑战，提出了视觉-惯性束调整（VIBA）和高斯泼溅物理图像形成模型，显著提升了重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常假设使用设备视觉-惯性里程计系统的帧率6DoF姿态估计，可能忽略像素级重建所需的关键细节。

Method: 提出VIBA校准滚动快门RGB相机的高频轨迹，并结合高斯泼溅的物理图像形成模型，解决传感器特性问题。

Result: 实验表明，VIBA带来+1 dB的PSNR提升，图像形成模型进一步增加+1 dB。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在多种光照条件下均显著提升了重建质量，适用于广泛的高斯泼溅表示变体。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the challenges associated with using egocentric
devices to photorealistic reconstruct the scene in high dynamic range. Existing
methodologies typically assume using frame-rate 6DoF pose estimated from the
device's visual-inertial odometry system, which may neglect crucial details
necessary for pixel-accurate reconstruction. This study presents two
significant findings. Firstly, in contrast to mainstream work treating RGB
camera as global shutter frame-rate camera, we emphasize the importance of
employing visual-inertial bundle adjustment (VIBA) to calibrate the precise
timestamps and movement of the rolling shutter RGB sensing camera in a high
frequency trajectory format, which ensures an accurate calibration of the
physical properties of the rolling-shutter camera. Secondly, we incorporate a
physical image formation model based into Gaussian Splatting, which effectively
addresses the sensor characteristics, including the rolling-shutter effect of
RGB cameras and the dynamic ranges measured by sensors. Our proposed
formulation is applicable to the widely-used variants of Gaussian Splats
representation. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of our pipeline using the
open-source Project Aria device under diverse indoor and outdoor lighting
conditions, and further validate it on a Meta Quest3 device. Across all
experiments, we observe a consistent visual enhancement of +1 dB in PSNR by
incorporating VIBA, with an additional +1 dB achieved through our proposed
image formation model. Our complete implementation, evaluation datasets, and
recording profile are available at

### [10] [Fine-Tuning Video Transformers for Word-Level Bangla Sign Language: A Comparative Analysis for Classification Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04367)
*Jubayer Ahmed Bhuiyan Shawon,Hasan Mahmud,Kamrul Hasan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究通过微调VideoMAE、ViViT和TimeSformer等视频Transformer架构，在BdSLW60和BdSLW401数据集上实现了高效的孟加拉手语识别，其中VideoMAE表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高孟加拉手语（BdSL）识别的准确性和可扩展性，以改善听力障碍群体的无障碍交流。

Method: 使用视频Transformer架构（VideoMAE、ViViT、TimeSformer），在BdSLW60和BdSLW401数据集上进行微调，并采用数据增强和10折分层交叉验证。

Result: VideoMAE在BdSLW60上达到95.5%的准确率，在BdSLW401上达到81.04%，显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 视频Transformer模型在孟加拉手语识别中表现出色，具有可扩展性和高准确性潜力。

Abstract: Sign Language Recognition (SLR) involves the automatic identification and
classification of sign gestures from images or video, converting them into text
or speech to improve accessibility for the hearing-impaired community. In
Bangladesh, Bangla Sign Language (BdSL) serves as the primary mode of
communication for many individuals with hearing impairments. This study
fine-tunes state-of-the-art video transformer architectures -- VideoMAE, ViViT,
and TimeSformer -- on BdSLW60 (arXiv:2402.08635), a small-scale BdSL dataset
with 60 frequent signs. We standardized the videos to 30 FPS, resulting in
9,307 user trial clips. To evaluate scalability and robustness, the models were
also fine-tuned on BdSLW401 (arXiv:2503.02360), a large-scale dataset with 401
sign classes. Additionally, we benchmark performance against public datasets,
including LSA64 and WLASL. Data augmentation techniques such as random
cropping, horizontal flipping, and short-side scaling were applied to improve
model robustness. To ensure balanced evaluation across folds during model
selection, we employed 10-fold stratified cross-validation on the training set,
while signer-independent evaluation was carried out using held-out test data
from unseen users U4 and U8. Results show that video transformer models
significantly outperform traditional machine learning and deep learning
approaches. Performance is influenced by factors such as dataset size, video
quality, frame distribution, frame rate, and model architecture. Among the
models, the VideoMAE variant (MCG-NJU/videomae-base-finetuned-kinetics)
achieved the highest accuracies of 95.5% on the frame rate corrected BdSLW60
dataset and 81.04% on the front-facing signs of BdSLW401 -- demonstrating
strong potential for scalable and accurate BdSL recognition.

### [11] [Visualizing and Controlling Cortical Responses Using Voxel-Weighted Activation Maximization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04379)
*Matthew W. Shinkle,Mark D. Lescroart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种将激活最大化技术应用于基于DNN的脑编码模型的方法，用于预测和调控人类视觉系统的响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管DNN编码模型能准确预测大脑对视觉刺激的响应，但缺乏对驱动这些响应的具体特征的理解。

Method: 通过提取和自适应下采样预训练Inception V3网络的激活，结合线性回归预测fMRI响应，并应用激活最大化生成优化图像。

Result: 生成的图像能可靠驱动目标脑区活动，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 激活最大化技术可成功应用于DNN编码模型，为人类视觉系统的灵活表征和调控提供了新途径。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) trained on visual tasks develop feature
representations that resemble those in the human visual system. Although
DNN-based encoding models can accurately predict brain responses to visual
stimuli, they offer limited insight into the specific features driving these
responses. Here, we demonstrate that activation maximization -- a technique
designed to interpret vision DNNs -- can be applied to DNN-based encoding
models of the human brain. We extract and adaptively downsample activations
from multiple layers of a pretrained Inception V3 network, then use linear
regression to predict fMRI responses. This yields a full image-computable model
of brain responses. Next, we apply activation maximization to generate images
optimized for predicted responses in individual cortical voxels. We find that
these images contain visual characteristics that qualitatively correspond with
known selectivity and enable exploration of selectivity across the visual
cortex. We further extend our method to whole regions of interest (ROIs) of the
brain and validate its efficacy by presenting these images to human
participants in an fMRI study. We find that the generated images reliably drive
activity in targeted regions across both low- and high-level visual areas and
across subjects. These results demonstrate that activation maximization can be
successfully applied to DNN-based encoding models. By addressing key
limitations of alternative approaches that require natively generative models,
our approach enables flexible characterization and modulation of responses
across the human visual system.

### [12] [Is Perturbation-Based Image Protection Disruptive to Image Editing?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04394)
*Qiuyu Tang,Bonor Ayambem,Mooi Choo Chuah,Aparna Bharati*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现，现有的基于扰动的图像保护方法无法完全阻止扩散模型的编辑，反而可能增强图像与文本提示的关联性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨扩散模型（如Stable Diffusion）在图像生成中的滥用风险，以及现有图像保护方法的有效性。

Method: 通过实验评估多种基于扰动的图像保护方法在不同领域（自然场景图像和艺术作品）和编辑任务（图像到图像生成和风格编辑）中的表现。

Result: 发现保护方法未能完全阻止编辑，反而可能使编辑结果更符合文本提示，导致更好的编辑效果。

Conclusion: 基于扰动的方法不足以提供针对扩散模型编辑的鲁棒图像保护。

Abstract: The remarkable image generation capabilities of state-of-the-art diffusion
models, such as Stable Diffusion, can also be misused to spread misinformation
and plagiarize copyrighted materials. To mitigate the potential risks
associated with image editing, current image protection methods rely on adding
imperceptible perturbations to images to obstruct diffusion-based editing. A
fully successful protection for an image implies that the output of editing
attempts is an undesirable, noisy image which is completely unrelated to the
reference image. In our experiments with various perturbation-based image
protection methods across multiple domains (natural scene images and artworks)
and editing tasks (image-to-image generation and style editing), we discover
that such protection does not achieve this goal completely. In most scenarios,
diffusion-based editing of protected images generates a desirable output image
which adheres precisely to the guidance prompt. Our findings suggest that
adding noise to images may paradoxically increase their association with given
text prompts during the generation process, leading to unintended consequences
such as better resultant edits. Hence, we argue that perturbation-based methods
may not provide a sufficient solution for robust image protection against
diffusion-based editing.

### [13] [Normalize Filters! Classical Wisdom for Deep Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04401)
*Gustavo Perez,Stella X. Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种滤波器归一化方法，通过可学习的缩放和平移（类似于批量归一化）来解决深度学习卷积滤波器缺乏归一化的问题，从而提升模型在强度变化场景下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像滤波器经过精心归一化以确保一致性和可解释性，而深度学习中的卷积滤波器缺乏此类约束，导致在图像经过大气传输时响应失真，影响结果准确性。

Method: 提出滤波器归一化方法，结合可学习的缩放和平移，确保滤波器具有大气等变性，实现共域对称性。该方法适用于卷积神经网络和依赖卷积的视觉变换器。

Result: 在人工和自然强度变化基准测试中取得显著改进，ResNet34甚至大幅超越CLIP。分析表明，归一化滤波器能提升多样性、鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 滤波器归一化是一种简单有效的改进方法，通过融入传统滤波原理，显著提升了深度学习模型的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Classical image filters, such as those for averaging or differencing, are
carefully normalized to ensure consistency, interpretability, and to avoid
artifacts like intensity shifts, halos, or ringing. In contrast, convolutional
filters learned end-to-end in deep networks lack such constraints. Although
they may resemble wavelets and blob/edge detectors, they are not normalized in
the same or any way. Consequently, when images undergo atmospheric transfer,
their responses become distorted, leading to incorrect outcomes. We address
this limitation by proposing filter normalization, followed by learnable
scaling and shifting, akin to batch normalization. This simple yet effective
modification ensures that the filters are atmosphere-equivariant, enabling
co-domain symmetry. By integrating classical filtering principles into deep
learning (applicable to both convolutional neural networks and
convolution-dependent vision transformers), our method achieves significant
improvements on artificial and natural intensity variation benchmarks. Our
ResNet34 could even outperform CLIP by a large margin. Our analysis reveals
that unnormalized filters degrade performance, whereas filter normalization
regularizes learning, promotes diversity, and improves robustness and
generalization.

TL;DR: HMAR是一种新的图像生成算法，通过改进VAR的并行生成问题，实现了更高质量的图像生成和更快的采样速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VAR在图像生成中存在并行生成导致质量下降、序列长度随分辨率超线性增长以及采样计划需重新训练的问题。

Method: HMAR采用马尔可夫过程和多步掩码生成，仅依赖前一尺度的令牌进行预测，并引入块稀疏注意力内核优化效率。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256和512x512基准测试中，HMAR表现优于或匹配VAR、扩散和自回归基线模型，训练和推理速度分别提升2.5倍和1.75倍。

Conclusion: HMAR提供了更高的灵活性，采样计划无需重新训练，并可零样本应用于图像编辑任务。

Abstract: Visual Auto-Regressive modeling (VAR) has shown promise in bridging the speed
and quality gap between autoregressive image models and diffusion models. VAR
reformulates autoregressive modeling by decomposing an image into successive
resolution scales. During inference, an image is generated by predicting all
the tokens in the next (higher-resolution) scale, conditioned on all tokens in
all previous (lower-resolution) scales. However, this formulation suffers from
reduced image quality due to the parallel generation of all tokens in a
resolution scale; has sequence lengths scaling superlinearly in image
resolution; and requires retraining to change the sampling schedule.
  We introduce Hierarchical Masked Auto-Regressive modeling (HMAR), a new image
generation algorithm that alleviates these issues using next-scale prediction
and masked prediction to generate high-quality images with fast sampling. HMAR
reformulates next-scale prediction as a Markovian process, wherein the
prediction of each resolution scale is conditioned only on tokens in its
immediate predecessor instead of the tokens in all predecessor resolutions.
When predicting a resolution scale, HMAR uses a controllable multi-step masked
generation procedure to generate a subset of the tokens in each step. On
ImageNet 256x256 and 512x512 benchmarks, HMAR models match or outperform
parameter-matched VAR, diffusion, and autoregressive baselines. We develop
efficient IO-aware block-sparse attention kernels that allow HMAR to achieve
faster training and inference times over VAR by over 2.5x and 1.75x
respectively, as well as over 3x lower inference memory footprint. Finally,
HMAR yields additional flexibility over VAR; its sampling schedule can be
changed without further training, and it can be applied to image editing tasks
in a zero-shot manner.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种称为“面部去正面化”的方法，通过增强训练数据集来改进姿态不变的人脸识别，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决极端头部姿态下人脸识别的挑战，避免现有方法在小数据集上的过拟合问题。

Method: 1) 训练一个改进的FFWM模型用于面部去正面化；2) 在原始和随机去正面化的大规模数据集上训练基于ArcFace损失的ResNet-50模型。

Result: 在四个公开数据集上表现优于现有方法，但在极端姿态的小数据集Multi-PIE上效果有限。

Conclusion: 面部去正面化是一种有效的姿态不变人脸识别方法，但需注意避免对小数据集的过拟合。

Abstract: Face recognition under extreme head poses is a challenging task. Ideally, a
face recognition system should perform well across different head poses, which
is known as pose-invariant face recognition. To achieve pose invariance,
current approaches rely on sophisticated methods, such as face frontalization
and various facial feature extraction model architectures. However, these
methods are somewhat impractical in real-life settings and are typically
evaluated on small scientific datasets, such as Multi-PIE. In this work, we
propose the inverse method of face frontalization, called face
defrontalization, to augment the training dataset of facial feature extraction
model. The method does not introduce any time overhead during the inference
step. The method is composed of: 1) training an adapted face defrontalization
FFWM model on a frontal-profile pairs dataset, which has been preprocessed
using our proposed face alignment method; 2) training a ResNet-50 facial
feature extraction model based on ArcFace loss on a raw and randomly
defrontalized large-scale dataset, where defrontalization was performed with
our previously trained face defrontalization model. Our method was compared
with the existing approaches on four open-access datasets: LFW, AgeDB, CFP, and
Multi-PIE. Defrontalization shows improved results compared to models without
defrontalization, while the proposed adjustments show clear superiority over
the state-of-the-art face frontalization FFWM method on three larger
open-access datasets, but not on the small Multi-PIE dataset for extreme poses
(75 and 90 degrees). The results suggest that at least some of the current
methods may be overfitted to small datasets.

TL;DR: FALO是一种硬件友好的LiDAR 3D检测方法，结合了高精度和快速推理速度，适用于资源受限的边缘设备。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LiDAR 3D检测方法依赖稀疏卷积或Transformer，内存访问不规则且计算成本高，难以在边缘设备上高效运行。

Method: FALO将稀疏3D体素排列为1D序列，通过ConvDotMix块（大核卷积、Hadamard积和线性层）处理，引入隐式分组以提高效率。

Result: 在nuScenes和Waymo等基准测试中，FALO表现优异，推理速度比最新SOTA快1.6~9.8倍。

Conclusion: FALO在保持高精度的同时显著提升推理速度，适合部署在资源受限的嵌入式设备上。

Abstract: Existing LiDAR 3D object detection methods predominantely rely on sparse
convolutions and/or transformers, which can be challenging to run on
resource-constrained edge devices, due to irregular memory access patterns and
high computational costs. In this paper, we propose FALO, a hardware-friendly
approach to LiDAR 3D detection, which offers both state-of-the-art (SOTA)
detection accuracy and fast inference speed. More specifically, given the 3D
point cloud and after voxelization, FALO first arranges sparse 3D voxels into a
1D sequence based on their coordinates and proximity. The sequence is then
processed by our proposed ConvDotMix blocks, consisting of large-kernel
convolutions, Hadamard products, and linear layers. ConvDotMix provides
sufficient mixing capability in both spatial and embedding dimensions, and
introduces higher-order nonlinear interaction among spatial features.
Furthermore, when going through the ConvDotMix layers, we introduce implicit
grouping, which balances the tensor dimensions for more efficient inference and
takes into account the growing receptive field. All these operations are
friendly to run on resource-constrained platforms and proposed FALO can readily
deploy on compact, embedded devices. Our extensive evaluation on LiDAR 3D
detection benchmarks such as nuScenes and Waymo shows that FALO achieves
competitive performance. Meanwhile, FALO is 1.6~9.8x faster than the latest
SOTA on mobile Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) and mobile Neural Processing Unit
(NPU).

Motivation: 现有深度伪造检测技术依赖训练时学习的统计特征，难以应对新出现的伪造方法。

Method: 结合图像文本对比学习和数据不确定性学习，训练视觉编码器，并与LLM结合。

Result: 在多个数据集上取得显著性能提升，包括DFDC（AUC提升6.15%）和DF40（AUC提升16.68%）。

Conclusion: AuthGuard通过语言指导和视觉编码器的结合，实现了更泛化和可解释的深度伪造检测。

Abstract: Existing deepfake detection techniques struggle to keep-up with the
ever-evolving novel, unseen forgeries methods. This limitation stems from their
reliance on statistical artifacts learned during training, which are often tied
to specific generation processes that may not be representative of samples from
new, unseen deepfake generation methods encountered at test time. We propose
that incorporating language guidance can improve deepfake detection
generalization by integrating human-like commonsense reasoning -- such as
recognizing logical inconsistencies and perceptual anomalies -- alongside
statistical cues. To achieve this, we train an expert deepfake vision encoder
by combining discriminative classification with image-text contrastive
learning, where the text is generated by generalist MLLMs using few-shot
prompting. This allows the encoder to extract both language-describable,
commonsense deepfake artifacts and statistical forgery artifacts from
pixel-level distributions. To further enhance robustness, we integrate data
uncertainty learning into vision-language contrastive learning, mitigating
noise in image-text supervision. Our expert vision encoder seamlessly
interfaces with an LLM, further enabling more generalized and interpretable
deepfake detection while also boosting accuracy. The resulting framework,
AuthGuard, achieves state-of-the-art deepfake detection accuracy in both
in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, achieving AUC gains of 6.15%
on the DFDC dataset and 16.68% on the DF40 dataset. Additionally, AuthGuard
significantly enhances deepfake reasoning, improving performance by 24.69% on
the DDVQA dataset.

Result: 在ResNet56和ResNet110上实现86.37%和95.82%的FLOPs减少，同时保持或提升模型精度，并增强对抗性和分布外样本的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法为剪枝领域开辟了新方向，显著提升计算效率并减少碳排放，推动GreenAI发展。

Abstract: Deep learning stands as the modern paradigm for solving cognitive tasks.
However, as the problem complexity increases, models grow deeper and
computationally prohibitive, hindering advancements in real-world and
resource-constrained applications. Extensive studies reveal that pruning
structures in these models efficiently reduces model complexity and improves
computational efficiency. Successful strategies in this sphere include removing
neurons (i.e., filters, heads) or layers, but not both together. Therefore,
simultaneously pruning different structures remains an open problem. To fill
this gap and leverage the benefits of eliminating neurons and layers at once,
we propose a new method capable of pruning different structures within a model
as follows. Given two candidate subnetworks (pruned models), one from layer
pruning and the other from neuron pruning, our method decides which to choose
by selecting the one with the highest representation similarity to its parent
(the network that generates the subnetworks) using the Centered Kernel
Alignment metric. Iteratively repeating this process provides highly sparse
models that preserve the original predictive ability. Throughout extensive
experiments on standard architectures and benchmarks, we confirm the
effectiveness of our approach and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art
layer and filter pruning techniques. At high levels of Floating Point
Operations reduction, most state-of-the-art methods degrade accuracy, whereas
our approach either improves it or experiences only a minimal drop. Notably, on
the popular ResNet56 and ResNet110, we achieve a milestone of 86.37% and 95.82%
FLOPs reduction. Besides, our pruned models obtain robustness to adversarial
and out-of-distribution samples and take an important step towards GreenAI,
reducing carbon emissions by up to 83.31%. Overall, we believe our work opens a
new chapter in pruning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决智能终端设备在低分辨率和有限能量下难以实现实时监测的问题。

Method: 采用SRCNN提升图像分辨率，SCU降低功耗，GAT模块融合多尺度特征。

Result: 在CrackVision12K基准测试中达到98.6%的准确率，功耗仅为5.6 mJ。

Conclusion: EECD-Net为资源受限环境提供了一种可扩展、低功耗的实时监测解决方案。

Abstract: Crack detection on road surfaces is a critical measurement technology in the
instrumentation domain, essential for ensuring infrastructure safety and
transportation reliability. However, due to limited energy and low-resolution
imaging, smart terminal devices struggle to maintain real-time monitoring
performance. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-stage
detection approach for road crack detection, EECD-Net, to enhance accuracy and
energy efficiency of instrumentation. Specifically, the sophisticated
Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (SRCNN) is employed to address
the inherent challenges of low-quality images, which effectively enhance image
resolution while preserving critical structural details. Meanwhile, a Spike
Convolution Unit (SCU) with Continuous Integrate-and-Fire (CIF) neurons is
proposed to convert these images into sparse pulse sequences, significantly
reducing power consumption. Additionally, a Gated Attention Transformer (GAT)
module is designed to strategically fuse multi-scale feature representations
through adaptive attention mechanisms, effectively capturing both long-range
dependencies and intricate local crack patterns, and significantly enhancing
detection robustness across varying crack morphologies. The experiments on the
CrackVision12K benchmark demonstrate that EECD-Net achieves a remarkable 98.6\%
detection accuracy, surpassing state-of-the-art counterparts such as
Hybrid-Segmentor by a significant 1.5\%. Notably, the EECD-Net maintains
exceptional energy efficiency, consuming merely 5.6 mJ, which is a substantial
33\% reduction compared to baseline implementations. This work pioneers a
transformative approach in instrumentation-based crack detection, offering a
scalable, low-power solution for real-time, large-scale infrastructure
monitoring in resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为可学习可分离核（LSKs）的即插即用模块，用于直接增强图像频率成分，显著减少参数和计算需求，并提升超分辨率性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常通过间接方式（如特殊损失函数）提升单图像超分辨率（SISR）性能，但缺乏直接增强频率成分的模块。

Method: 设计了一种形式为秩一矩阵的LSKs模块，并将其分解为可合并的一维核以减少参数和计算量。

Result: 实验表明，LSKs减少了60%以上的参数和计算需求，同时提升了模型性能，尤其在高放大因子下表现更优。

Conclusion: LSKs是一种高效且有效的模块，可直接增强图像频率成分，显著提升SISR任务的性能。

Abstract: Existing approaches often enhance the performance of single-image
super-resolution (SISR) methods by incorporating auxiliary structures, such as
specialized loss functions, to indirectly boost the quality of low-resolution
images. In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play module called Learnable
Separable Kernels (LSKs), which are formally rank-one matrices designed to
directly enhance image frequency components. We begin by explaining why LSKs
are particularly suitable for SISR tasks from a frequency perspective. Baseline
methods incorporating LSKs demonstrate a significant reduction of over 60\% in
both the number of parameters and computational requirements. This reduction is
achieved through the decomposition of LSKs into orthogonal and mergeable
one-dimensional kernels. Additionally, we perform an interpretable analysis of
the feature maps generated by LSKs. Visualization results reveal the capability
of LSKs to enhance image frequency components effectively. Extensive
experiments show that incorporating LSKs not only reduces the number of
parameters and computational load but also improves overall model performance.
Moreover, these experiments demonstrate that models utilizing LSKs exhibit
superior performance, particularly as the upscaling factor increases.

Result: 在数学和科学基准测试中达到最先进性能，支持更高级推理模型的即插即用。

Conclusion: RACRO显著提升视觉基础能力，同时支持高效扩展和适应。

Abstract: Recent advances in slow-thinking language models (e.g., OpenAI-o1 and
DeepSeek-R1) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in complex reasoning tasks
by emulating human-like reflective cognition. However, extending such
capabilities to multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) remains challenging
due to the high cost of retraining vision-language alignments when upgrading
the underlying reasoner LLMs. A straightforward solution is to decouple
perception from reasoning, i.e., converting visual inputs into language
representations (e.g., captions) that are then passed to a powerful text-only
reasoner. However, this decoupling introduces a critical challenge: the visual
extractor must generate descriptions that are both faithful to the image and
informative enough to support accurate downstream reasoning. To address this,
we propose Reasoning-Aligned Perceptual Decoupling via Caption Reward
Optimization (RACRO) - a reasoning-guided reinforcement learning strategy that
aligns the extractor's captioning behavior with the reasoning objective. By
closing the perception-reasoning loop via reward-based optimization, RACRO
significantly enhances visual grounding and extracts reasoning-optimized
representations. Experiments on multi-modal math and science benchmarks show
that the proposed RACRO method achieves state-of-the-art average performance
while enabling superior scalability and plug-and-play adaptation to more
advanced reasoning LLMs without the necessity for costly multi-modal
re-alignment.

Conclusion: LGM-Pose通过单分支结构和创新模块设计，有效解决了现有方法的不足，为轻量级姿态估计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Most of the current top-down multi-person pose estimation lightweight methods
are based on multi-branch parallel pure CNN network architecture, which often
struggle to capture the global context required for detecting semantically
complex keypoints and are hindered by high latency due to their intricate and
redundant structures. In this article, an approximate single-branch lightweight
global modeling network (LGM-Pose) is proposed to address these challenges. In
the network, a lightweight MobileViM Block is designed with a proposed
Lightweight Attentional Representation Module (LARM), which integrates
information within and between patches using the Non-Parametric Transformation
Operation(NPT-Op) to extract global information. Additionally, a novel
Shuffle-Integrated Fusion Module (SFusion) is introduced to effectively
integrate multi-scale information, mitigating performance degradation often
observed in single-branch structures. Experimental evaluations on the COCO and
MPII datasets demonstrate that our approach not only reduces the number of
parameters compared to existing mainstream lightweight methods but also
achieves superior performance and faster processing speeds.

Conclusion: 该框架有效利用了基础模型的先验知识，实现了灵活且高质量的4D视频生成与编辑。

Abstract: We introduce Follow-Your-Creation, a novel 4D video creation framework
capable of both generating and editing 4D content from a single monocular video
input. By leveraging a powerful video inpainting foundation model as a
generative prior, we reformulate 4D video creation as a video inpainting task,
enabling the model to fill in missing content caused by camera trajectory
changes or user edits. To facilitate this, we generate composite masked
inpainting video data to effectively fine-tune the model for 4D video
generation. Given an input video and its associated camera trajectory, we first
perform depth-based point cloud rendering to obtain invisibility masks that
indicate the regions that should be completed. Simultaneously, editing masks
are introduced to specify user-defined modifications, and these are combined
with the invisibility masks to create a composite masks dataset. During
training, we randomly sample different types of masks to construct diverse and
challenging inpainting scenarios, enhancing the model's generalization and
robustness in various 4D editing and generation tasks. To handle temporal
consistency under large camera motion, we design a self-iterative tuning
strategy that gradually increases the viewing angles during training, where the
model is used to generate the next-stage training data after each fine-tuning
iteration. Moreover, we introduce a temporal packaging module during inference
to enhance generation quality. Our method effectively leverages the prior
knowledge of the base model without degrading its original performance,
enabling the generation of 4D videos with consistent multi-view coherence. In
addition, our approach supports prompt-based content editing, demonstrating
strong flexibility and significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods in
both quality and versatility.

Conclusion: HEC和Task-aware MoILE方法能有效支持智能体持续学习新任务的同时保留旧知识。

Abstract: Previous continual learning setups for embodied intelligence focused on
executing low-level actions based on human commands, neglecting the ability to
learn high-level planning and multi-level knowledge. To address these issues,
we propose the Hierarchical Embodied Continual Learning Setups (HEC) that
divide the agent's continual learning process into two layers: high-level
instructions and low-level actions, and define five embodied continual learning
sub-setups. Building on these setups, we introduce the Task-aware Mixture of
Incremental LoRA Experts (Task-aware MoILE) method. This approach achieves task
recognition by clustering visual-text embeddings and uses both a task-level
router and a token-level router to select the appropriate LoRA experts. To
effectively address the issue of catastrophic forgetting, we apply Singular
Value Decomposition (SVD) to the LoRA parameters obtained from prior tasks,
preserving key components while orthogonally training the remaining parts. The
experimental results show that our method stands out in reducing the forgetting
of old tasks compared to other methods, effectively supporting agents in
retaining prior knowledge while continuously learning new tasks.

Conclusion: SmartAvatar是一个高效、灵活的工具，适用于消费级硬件上的逼真头像生成。

Abstract: SmartAvatar is a vision-language-agent-driven framework for generating fully
rigged, animation-ready 3D human avatars from a single photo or textual prompt.
While diffusion-based methods have made progress in general 3D object
generation, they continue to struggle with precise control over human identity,
body shape, and animation readiness. In contrast, SmartAvatar leverages the
commonsense reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (VLMs) in
combination with off-the-shelf parametric human generators to deliver
high-quality, customizable avatars. A key innovation is an autonomous
verification loop, where the agent renders draft avatars, evaluates facial
similarity, anatomical plausibility, and prompt alignment, and iteratively
adjusts generation parameters for convergence. This interactive, AI-guided
refinement process promotes fine-grained control over both facial and body
features, enabling users to iteratively refine their avatars via
natural-language conversations. Unlike diffusion models that rely on static
pre-trained datasets and offer limited flexibility, SmartAvatar brings users
into the modeling loop and ensures continuous improvement through an LLM-driven
procedural generation and verification system. The generated avatars are fully
rigged and support pose manipulation with consistent identity and appearance,
making them suitable for downstream animation and interactive applications.
Quantitative benchmarks and user studies demonstrate that SmartAvatar
outperforms recent text- and image-driven avatar generation systems in terms of
reconstructed mesh quality, identity fidelity, attribute accuracy, and
animation readiness, making it a versatile tool for realistic, customizable
avatar creation on consumer-grade hardware.

Abstract: We propose a novel two-stage framework for sensor depth enhancement, called
Perfecting Depth. This framework leverages the stochastic nature of diffusion
models to automatically detect unreliable depth regions while preserving
geometric cues. In the first stage (stochastic estimation), the method
identifies unreliable measurements and infers geometric structure by leveraging
a training-inference domain gap. In the second stage (deterministic
refinement), it enforces structural consistency and pixel-level accuracy using
the uncertainty map derived from the first stage. By combining stochastic
uncertainty modeling with deterministic refinement, our method yields dense,
artifact-free depth maps with improved reliability. Experimental results
demonstrate its effectiveness across diverse real-world scenarios. Furthermore,
theoretical analysis, various experiments, and qualitative visualizations
validate its robustness and scalability. Our framework sets a new baseline for
sensor depth enhancement, with potential applications in autonomous driving,
robotics, and immersive technologies.

recover 3D structure and camera geometry, serves as a cornerstone in computer
vision and underpins a wide range of applications, including visual
localization, 3D reconstruction, and simultaneous localization and mapping
(SLAM). Traditional pipelines composed of ``detector-descriptor, feature
matcher, outlier filter, and geometric estimator'' falter in challenging
scenarios. Recent deep-learning advances have significantly boosted both
robustness and accuracy. This survey adopts a unique perspective by
comprehensively reviewing how deep learning has incrementally transformed the
classical image matching pipeline. Our taxonomy highly aligns with the
traditional pipeline in two key aspects: i) the replacement of individual steps
in the traditional pipeline with learnable alternatives, including learnable
detector-descriptor, outlier filter, and geometric estimator; and ii) the
merging of multiple steps into end-to-end learnable modules, encompassing
middle-end sparse matcher, end-to-end semi-dense/dense matcher, and pose
regressor. We first examine the design principles, advantages, and limitations
of both aspects, and then benchmark representative methods on relative pose
recovery, homography estimation, and visual localization tasks. Finally, we
discuss open challenges and outline promising directions for future research.
By systematically categorizing and evaluating deep learning-driven strategies,
this survey offers a clear overview of the evolving image matching landscape
and highlights key avenues for further innovation.

TL;DR: STARE是一个评估多模态大语言模型在空间认知任务中表现的基准，涵盖几何变换、空间推理和现实场景任务。模型在简单任务中表现良好，但在复杂任务中接近随机水平，且无法有效利用视觉模拟信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI基准主要关注语言推理，忽视了非语言、多步骤视觉模拟的空间认知能力。STARE旨在填补这一空白，评估模型在实际空间推理任务中的表现。

Method: STARE包含4K个任务，涵盖基础几何变换（2D和3D）、综合空间推理（立方体展开图和七巧板）及现实空间推理（视角和时间推理）。

Result: 模型在简单2D变换任务中表现良好，但在复杂任务（如3D立方体展开图和七巧板）中接近随机水平。人类表现接近完美但耗时较长，而模型在视觉模拟辅助下表现不一致。

Conclusion: 模型在复杂空间推理任务中表现不佳，且无法有效利用视觉模拟信息，表明其在多步骤视觉模拟能力上仍有局限。

Abstract: Spatial cognition is essential for human intelligence, enabling
problem-solving through visual simulations rather than solely relying on verbal
reasoning. However, existing AI benchmarks primarily assess verbal reasoning,
neglecting the complexities of non-verbal, multi-step visual simulation. We
introduce STARE(Spatial Transformations and Reasoning Evaluation), a benchmark
designed to rigorously evaluate multimodal large language models on tasks
better solved through multi-step visual simulation. STARE features 4K tasks
spanning foundational geometric transformations (2D and 3D), integrated spatial
reasoning (cube net folding and tangram puzzles), and real-world spatial
reasoning (perspective and temporal reasoning), reflecting practical cognitive
challenges like object assembly, mechanical diagram interpretation, and
everyday spatial navigation. Our evaluations show that models excel at
reasoning over simpler 2D transformations, but perform close to random chance
on more complex tasks like 3D cube net folding and tangram puzzles that require
multi-step visual simulations. Humans achieve near-perfect accuracy but take
considerable time (up to 28.9s) on complex tasks, significantly speeding up
(down by 7.5 seconds on average) with intermediate visual simulations. In
contrast, models exhibit inconsistent performance gains from visual
simulations, improving on most tasks but declining in specific cases like
tangram puzzles (GPT-4o, o1) and cube net folding (Claude-3.5, Gemini-2.0
Flash), indicating that models may not know how to effectively leverage
intermediate visual information.

Abstract: The introduction of generative models has significantly advanced image
super-resolution (SR) in handling real-world degradations. However, they often
incur fidelity-related issues, particularly distorting textual structures. In
this paper, we introduce a novel diffusion-based SR framework, namely TADiSR,
which integrates text-aware attention and joint segmentation decoders to
recover not only natural details but also the structural fidelity of text
regions in degraded real-world images. Moreover, we propose a complete pipeline
for synthesizing high-quality images with fine-grained full-image text masks,
combining realistic foreground text regions with detailed background content.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach substantially enhances text
legibility in super-resolved images, achieving state-of-the-art performance
across multiple evaluation metrics and exhibiting strong generalization to
real-world scenarios. Our code is available at

TL;DR: FPSAttention是一种结合FP8量化和稀疏化的训练感知协同设计方法，用于视频生成，显著提升了推理速度而不牺牲生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散生成模型在高质量视频生成中表现优异，但推理速度慢且计算需求高，限制了实际应用。量化和稀疏化虽能独立加速推理，但简单结合会导致性能下降。

Method: FPSAttention提出三种创新：1) 统一的3D分块粒度支持量化和稀疏化；2) 去噪步骤感知策略；3) 硬件友好的内核实现。

Result: 在1.3B和14B模型上测试，FPSAttention实现了7.09倍注意力操作加速和4.96倍端到端视频生成加速，720p分辨率下生成质量未下降。

Conclusion: FPSAttention通过联合优化量化和稀疏化，显著提升了视频生成的效率，为实际部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Diffusion generative models have become the standard for producing
high-quality, coherent video content, yet their slow inference speeds and high
computational demands hinder practical deployment. Although both quantization
and sparsity can independently accelerate inference while maintaining
generation quality, naively combining these techniques in existing
training-free approaches leads to significant performance degradation due to
the lack of joint optimization.We introduce FPSAttention, a novel
training-aware co-design of FP8 quantization and sparsity for video generation,
with a focus on the 3D bi-directional attention mechanism. Our approach
features three key innovations: 1) A unified 3D tile-wise granularity that
simultaneously supports both quantization and sparsity; 2) A denoising
step-aware strategy that adapts to the noise schedule, addressing the strong
correlation between quantization/sparsity errors and denoising steps; 3) A
native, hardware-friendly kernel that leverages FlashAttention and is
implemented with optimized Hopper architecture features for highly efficient
execution. Trained on Wan2.1's 1.3B and 14B models and evaluated on the VBench
benchmark, FPSAttention achieves a 7.09x kernel speedup for attention
operations and a 4.96x end-to-end speedup for video generation compared to the
BF16 baseline at 720p resolution-without sacrificing generation quality.

Motivation: 传统表示学习假设解耦的独立特征轴是好的表示，但无法解释条件独立性。本文旨在通过群分解理论解决这一问题，并扩展到现实场景。

Method: 结合特征提取和对象分割，将像素平移替换为特征平移，并将对象分割定义为相同变换下的特征分组。

Result: 在包含真实世界对象和背景的数据集上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法有望更好地理解人类在现实世界中的物体识别发展。

Abstract: The main goal of representation learning is to acquire meaningful
representations from real-world sensory inputs without supervision.
Representation learning explains some aspects of human development. Various
neural network (NN) models have been proposed that acquire empirically good
representations. However, the formulation of a good representation has not been
established. We recently proposed a method for categorizing changes between a
pair of sensory inputs. A unique feature of this approach is that
transformations between two sensory inputs are learned to satisfy algebraic
structural constraints. Conventional representation learning often assumes that
disentangled independent feature axes is a good representation; however, we
found that such a representation cannot account for conditional independence.
To overcome this problem, we proposed a new method using group decomposition in
Galois algebra theory. Although this method is promising for defining a more
general representation, it assumes pixel-to-pixel translation without feature
extraction, and can only process low-resolution images with no background,
which prevents real-world application. In this study, we provide a simple
method to apply our group decomposition theory to a more realistic scenario by
combining feature extraction and object segmentation. We replace pixel
translation with feature translation and formulate object segmentation as
grouping features under the same transformation. We validated the proposed
method on a practical dataset containing both real-world object and background.
We believe that our model will lead to a better understanding of human
development of object recognition in the real world.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种Few-Shot Prototypical Concept Classification (FSPCC)框架，通过参数高效适应和多层次特征融合，解决了自解释模型在数据稀缺场景下的性能问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自解释模型在数据稀缺场景下表现不佳，主要由于参数不平衡和表示不对齐问题。

Method: 采用Mixture of LoRA Experts (MoLE)进行参数高效适应，结合跨模块概念指导和多层次特征融合策略，并引入几何感知的概念判别损失。

Result: 在六个基准测试中，FSPCC显著优于现有方法，5-way 5-shot分类任务中相对提升4.2%-8.7%。

Conclusion: FSPCC框架通过结合概念学习和少样本适应，实现了更高的准确性和模型可解释性，为透明视觉识别系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: Self-Explainable Models (SEMs) rely on Prototypical Concept Learning (PCL) to
enable their visual recognition processes more interpretable, but they often
struggle in data-scarce settings where insufficient training samples lead to
suboptimal performance.To address this limitation, we propose a Few-Shot
Prototypical Concept Classification (FSPCC) framework that systematically
mitigates two key challenges under low-data regimes: parametric imbalance and
representation misalignment. Specifically, our approach leverages a Mixture of
LoRA Experts (MoLE) for parameter-efficient adaptation, ensuring a balanced
allocation of trainable parameters between the backbone and the PCL
module.Meanwhile, cross-module concept guidance enforces tight alignment
between the backbone's feature representations and the prototypical concept
activation patterns.In addition, we incorporate a multi-level feature
preservation strategy that fuses spatial and semantic cues across various
layers, thereby enriching the learned representations and mitigating the
challenges posed by limited data availability.Finally, to enhance
interpretability and minimize concept overlap, we introduce a geometry-aware
concept discrimination loss that enforces orthogonality among concepts,
encouraging more disentangled and transparent decision boundaries.Experimental
results on six popular benchmarks (CUB-200-2011, mini-ImageNet, CIFAR-FS,
Stanford Cars, FGVC-Aircraft, and DTD) demonstrate that our approach
consistently outperforms existing SEMs by a notable margin, with 4.2%-8.7%
relative gains in 5-way 5-shot classification.These findings highlight the
efficacy of coupling concept learning with few-shot adaptation to achieve both
higher accuracy and clearer model interpretability, paving the way for more
transparent visual recognition systems.

TL;DR: Gen-n-Val是一个新型数据生成框架，利用Layer Diffusion、LLMs和VLLMs生成高质量单对象掩码和多样化背景，显著减少无效数据并提升性能。


<details>

Motivation: 解决计算机视觉任务中数据稀缺和标签噪声问题，当前合成数据生成方法存在多对象掩码、分割不准确和标签错误等缺陷。

Method: Gen-n-Val包含两个代理：LD提示代理优化提示生成高质量前景图像和掩码；数据验证代理过滤低质量数据。系统提示通过TextGrad优化，并使用图像协调技术组合场景中的多个实例。

Conclusion: Gen-n-Val显著提升了合成数据的质量和任务性能，适用于实例分割和目标检测任务。

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Large Language Models
(VLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance as agents across various tasks
while data scarcity and label noise remain significant challenges in computer
vision tasks, such as object detection and instance segmentation. A common
solution for resolving these issues is to generate synthetic data. However,
current synthetic data generation methods struggle with issues, such as
multiple objects per mask, inaccurate segmentation, and incorrect category
labels, limiting their effectiveness. To address these issues, we introduce
Gen-n-Val, a novel agentic data generation framework that leverages Layer
Diffusion (LD), LLMs, and VLLMs to produce high-quality, single-object masks
and diverse backgrounds. Gen-n-Val consists of two agents: (1) The LD prompt
agent, an LLM, optimizes prompts for LD to generate high-quality foreground
instance images and segmentation masks. These optimized prompts ensure the
generation of single-object synthetic data with precise instance masks and
clean backgrounds. (2) The data validation agent, a VLLM, which filters out
low-quality synthetic instance images. The system prompts for both agents are
refined through TextGrad. Additionally, we use image harmonization to combine
multiple instances within scenes. Compared to state-of-the-art synthetic data
approaches like MosaicFusion, our approach reduces invalid synthetic data from
50% to 7% and improves performance by 1% mAP on rare classes in COCO instance
segmentation with YOLOv9c and YOLO11m. Furthermore, Gen-n-Val shows significant
improvements (7. 1% mAP) over YOLO-Worldv2-M in open-vocabulary object
detection benchmarks with YOLO11m. Moreover, Gen-n-Val improves the performance
of YOLOv9 and YOLO11 families in instance segmentation and object detection.

Motivation: 无线电地图在智能城市和物联网等应用中至关重要，但稀疏测量下的重建仍具挑战性。传统方法缺乏环境感知，而深度学习依赖详细场景数据。

Method: 提出MARS方法，结合CNN和Transformer，利用多尺度特征融合和残差连接，提取全局和局部特征。

Result: 实验表明，MARS在MSE和SSIM上优于基线模型，计算成本低。

Conclusion: MARS具有强实用性，适用于不同场景和天线位置。

Abstract: Radio maps reflect the spatial distribution of signal strength and are
essential for applications like smart cities, IoT, and wireless network
planning. However, reconstructing accurate radio maps from sparse measurements
remains challenging. Traditional interpolation and inpainting methods lack
environmental awareness, while many deep learning approaches depend on detailed
scene data, limiting generalization. To address this, we propose MARS, a
Multi-scale Aware Radiomap Super-resolution method that combines CNNs and
Transformers with multi-scale feature fusion and residual connections. MARS
focuses on both global and local feature extraction, enhancing feature
representation across different receptive fields and improving reconstruction
accuracy. Experiments across different scenes and antenna locations show that
MARS outperforms baseline models in both MSE and SSIM, while maintaining low
computational cost, demonstrating strong practical potential.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLM安全方法存在两个主要问题：1）数据集和基准测试覆盖不全，导致模型易受攻击；2）缺乏架构创新。

Method: 引入HoliSafe数据集，覆盖五种安全/不安全图像-文本组合；提出SafeLLaVA模型，包含可学习的安全元标记和专用安全头。

Result: SafeLLaVA在多个VLM基准测试中达到最先进的安全性能；HoliSafe基准测试揭示了现有模型的漏洞。

Conclusion: HoliSafe和SafeLLaVA为VLM安全研究提供了新方向，推动了多模态对齐的进一步发展。

Abstract: Despite emerging efforts to enhance the safety of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), current approaches face two main shortcomings. 1) Existing
safety-tuning datasets and benchmarks only partially consider how image-text
interactions can yield harmful content, often overlooking contextually unsafe
outcomes from seemingly benign pairs. This narrow coverage leaves VLMs
vulnerable to jailbreak attacks in unseen configurations. 2) Prior methods rely
primarily on data-centric tuning, with limited architectural innovations to
intrinsically strengthen safety. We address these gaps by introducing a
holistic safety dataset and benchmark, HoliSafe, that spans all five
safe/unsafe image-text combinations, providing a more robust basis for both
training and evaluation. We further propose SafeLLaVA, a novel VLM augmented
with a learnable safety meta token and a dedicated safety head. The meta token
encodes harmful visual cues during training, intrinsically guiding the language
model toward safer responses, while the safety head offers interpretable
harmfulness classification aligned with refusal rationales. Experiments show
that SafeLLaVA, trained on HoliSafe, achieves state-of-the-art safety
performance across multiple VLM benchmarks. Additionally, the HoliSafe
benchmark itself reveals critical vulnerabilities in existing models. We hope
that HoliSafe and SafeLLaVA will spur further research into robust and
interpretable VLM safety, expanding future avenues for multimodal alignment.

Abstract: Language models can be equipped with multimodal capabilities by fine-tuning
on embeddings of visual inputs. But how do such multimodal models represent
images in their hidden activations? We explore representations of image
concepts within LlaVA-Next, a popular open-source VLLM. We find a diverse set
of ImageNet classes represented via linearly decodable features in the residual
stream. We show that the features are causal by performing targeted edits on
the model output. In order to increase the diversity of the studied linear
features, we train multimodal Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), creating a highly
interpretable dictionary of text and image features. We find that although
model representations across modalities are quite disjoint, they become
increasingly shared in deeper layers.

Motivation: 预训练视觉语言模型在少样本适应中面临分布外数据泛化能力不足的问题，需要提升其分布内和分布外的准确性。

Method: 比较了多种适应方法，提出部分微调视觉编码器并结合检索增强和对抗扰动技术，最终开发了SRAPF（两阶段方法）。

Result: SRAPF在ImageNet OOD基准测试中实现了最先进的分布内和分布外准确性。

Conclusion: 部分微调视觉编码器结合检索增强和对抗扰动是提升少样本适应性能的有效方法，SRAPF展示了其优越性。

Abstract: Pretrained VLMs achieve strong performance on downstream tasks when adapted
with just a few labeled examples. As the adapted models inevitably encounter
out-of-distribution (OOD) test data that deviates from the in-distribution (ID)
task-specific training data, enhancing OOD generalization in few-shot
adaptation is critically important. We study robust few-shot VLM adaptation,
aiming to increase both ID and OOD accuracy. By comparing different adaptation
methods (e.g., prompt tuning, linear probing, contrastive finetuning, and full
finetuning), we uncover three key findings: (1) finetuning with proper
hyperparameters significantly outperforms the popular VLM adaptation methods
prompt tuning and linear probing; (2) visual encoder-only finetuning achieves
better efficiency and accuracy than contrastively finetuning both visual and
textual encoders; (3) finetuning the top layers of the visual encoder provides
the best balance between ID and OOD accuracy. Building on these findings, we
propose partial finetuning of the visual encoder empowered with two simple
augmentation techniques: (1) retrieval augmentation which retrieves
task-relevant data from the VLM's pretraining dataset to enhance adaptation,
and (2) adversarial perturbation which promotes robustness during finetuning.
Results show that the former/latter boosts OOD/ID accuracy while slightly
sacrificing the ID/OOD accuracy. Yet, perhaps understandably, naively combining
the two does not maintain their best OOD/ID accuracy. We address this dilemma
with the developed SRAPF, Stage-wise Retrieval Augmentation-based Adversarial
Partial Finetuning. SRAPF consists of two stages: (1) partial finetuning the
visual encoder using both ID and retrieved data, and (2) adversarial partial
finetuning with few-shot ID data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SRAPF
achieves the state-of-the-art ID and OOD accuracy on the ImageNet OOD
benchmarks.

Motivation: AIGV技术发展迅速，但其视觉质量缺陷（如噪声、模糊等）影响用户体验，亟需有效的自动质量评估方法。

Method: 将AIGV视觉质量分解为技术质量、运动质量和视频语义三个维度，设计对应编码器；引入LLM作为质量回归模块，并设计多模态提示工程框架和LoRA微调技术。

Result: 在NTIRE 2025竞赛中取得第二名，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的多维度特征和LLM结合的方法能有效评估AIGV视觉质量，为内容监管和生成模型改进提供支持。

Abstract: The development of AI-Generated Video (AIGV) technology has been remarkable
in recent years, significantly transforming the paradigm of video content
production. However, AIGVs still suffer from noticeable visual quality defects,
such as noise, blurriness, frame jitter and low dynamic degree, which severely
impact the user's viewing experience. Therefore, an effective automatic visual
quality assessment is of great importance for AIGV content regulation and
generative model improvement. In this work, we decompose the visual quality of
AIGVs into three dimensions: technical quality, motion quality, and video
semantics. For each dimension, we design corresponding encoder to achieve
effective feature representation. Moreover, considering the outstanding
performance of large language models (LLMs) in various vision and language
tasks, we introduce a LLM as the quality regression module. To better enable
the LLM to establish reasoning associations between multi-dimensional features
and visual quality, we propose a specially designed multi-modal prompt
engineering framework. Additionally, we incorporate LoRA fine-tuning technology
during the training phase, allowing the LLM to better adapt to specific tasks.
Our proposed method achieved \textbf{second place} in the NTIRE 2025 Quality
Assessment of AI-Generated Content Challenge: Track 2 AI Generated video,

Motivation: 预测ESD视频中的解剖轨迹对提升手术技能训练和简化学习过程具有潜力，但目前研究不足。模仿学习虽有效，但在处理不确定性和几何对称性方面存在挑战。

Method: 提出iDPOE方法，结合扩散模型和等变表示，建模专家行为的联合状态动作分布，并通过前向过程引导的动作推理策略解决状态不匹配问题。

Result: 在近2000个ESD视频片段的数据集上，iDPOE在轨迹预测上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: iDPOE是首个将模仿学习应用于解剖轨迹预测的手术技能开发方法，具有显著优势。

Abstract: Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) is a well-established technique for
removing epithelial lesions. Predicting dissection trajectories in ESD videos
offers significant potential for enhancing surgical skill training and
simplifying the learning process, yet this area remains underexplored. While
imitation learning has shown promise in acquiring skills from expert
demonstrations, challenges persist in handling uncertain future movements,
learning geometric symmetries, and generalizing to diverse surgical scenarios.
To address these, we introduce a novel approach: Implicit Diffusion Policy with
Equivariant Representations for Imitation Learning (iDPOE). Our method models
expert behavior through a joint state action distribution, capturing the
stochastic nature of dissection trajectories and enabling robust visual
representation learning across various endoscopic views. By incorporating a
diffusion model into policy learning, iDPOE ensures efficient training and
sampling, leading to more accurate predictions and better generalization.
Additionally, we enhance the model's ability to generalize to geometric
symmetries by embedding equivariance into the learning process. To address
state mismatches, we develop a forward-process guided action inference strategy
for conditional sampling. Using an ESD video dataset of nearly 2000 clips,
experimental results show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods,
both explicit and implicit, in trajectory prediction. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first application of imitation learning to surgical
skill development for dissection trajectory prediction.

TL;DR: LAT是一个标签对齐转移框架，通过伪标签生成和特征融合，解决多数据集间的语义和空间不一致问题，提升目标检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多数据集结合可提升泛化能力，但类语义和标注框的不一致性阻碍了这一过程。现有方法或假设共享标签分类，或需手动重标，或生成统一标签空间，但可能不适用于固定目标标签空间的需求。

Method: LAT通过训练数据集特定检测器生成伪标签，结合特权提案生成器（PPG）和语义特征融合（SFF）模块，实现标签空间转移和特征优化。

Result: LAT在多个基准测试中显著提升目标域检测性能，最高比半监督基线提高4.8AP。

Conclusion: LAT无需共享标签空间或手动标注，即可同时解决类级和标注框不一致问题，适用于异构数据集训练下游检测器。

Abstract: Combining multiple object detection datasets offers a path to improved
generalisation but is hindered by inconsistencies in class semantics and
bounding box annotations. Some methods to address this assume shared label
taxonomies and address only spatial inconsistencies; others require manual
relabelling, or produce a unified label space, which may be unsuitable when a
fixed target label space is required. We propose Label-Aligned Transfer (LAT),
a label transfer framework that systematically projects annotations from
diverse source datasets into the label space of a target dataset. LAT begins by
training dataset-specific detectors to generate pseudo-labels, which are then
combined with ground-truth annotations via a Privileged Proposal Generator
(PPG) that replaces the region proposal network in two-stage detectors. To
further refine region features, a Semantic Feature Fusion (SFF) module injects
class-aware context and features from overlapping proposals using a
confidence-weighted attention mechanism. This pipeline preserves
dataset-specific annotation granularity while enabling many-to-one label space
transfer across heterogeneous datasets, resulting in a semantically and
spatially aligned representation suitable for training a downstream detector.
LAT thus jointly addresses both class-level misalignments and bounding box
inconsistencies without relying on shared label spaces or manual annotations.
Across multiple benchmarks, LAT demonstrates consistent improvements in
target-domain detection performance, achieving gains of up to +4.8AP over
semi-supervised baselines.

*Shuhan Xu,Siyuan Liang,Hongling Zheng,Yong Luo,Aishan Liu,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SRD的防御框架，通过强化学习抵御视觉语言模型中的后门攻击，无需预先知道触发器即可降低攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在图像描述任务中表现优异，但易受后门攻击，攻击者通过注入微小扰动控制模型输出恶意描述。现有防御方法难以应对这种隐蔽且跨模态的攻击。

Method: 提出Semantic Reward Defense (SRD)，基于强化学习框架，通过离散扰动（如遮挡、颜色掩码）干扰恶意路径激活，并设计语义保真度评分作为奖励信号。

Result: 实验表明，SRD将攻击成功率降至5.6%，同时在干净输入上保持描述质量，性能下降小于10%。

Conclusion: SRD提供了一种无需触发器先验知识、可解释的防御范式，有效应对多模态生成模型中的隐蔽后门威胁。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in image
captioning, but recent studies show they are vulnerable to backdoor attacks.
Attackers can inject imperceptible perturbations-such as local pixel triggers
or global semantic phrases-into the training data, causing the model to
generate malicious, attacker-controlled captions for specific inputs. These
attacks are hard to detect and defend due to their stealthiness and cross-modal
nature. By analyzing attack samples, we identify two key vulnerabilities: (1)
abnormal attention concentration on specific image regions, and (2) semantic
drift and incoherence in generated captions. To counter this, we propose
Semantic Reward Defense (SRD), a reinforcement learning framework that
mitigates backdoor behavior without prior knowledge of triggers. SRD uses a
Deep Q-Network to learn policies for applying discrete perturbations (e.g.,
occlusion, color masking) to sensitive image regions, aiming to disrupt the
activation of malicious pathways. We design a semantic fidelity score as the
reward signal, which jointly evaluates semantic consistency and linguistic
fluency of the output, guiding the agent toward generating robust yet faithful
captions. Experiments across mainstream VLMs and datasets show SRD reduces
attack success rates to 5.6%, while preserving caption quality on clean inputs
with less than 10% performance drop. SRD offers a trigger-agnostic,
interpretable defense paradigm against stealthy backdoor threats in multimodal
generative models.

*Shenshen Li,Kaiyuan Deng,Lei Wang,Hao Yang,Chong Peng,Peng Yan,Fumin Shen,Heng Tao Shen,Xing Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为RAP的数据选择范式，通过识别稀疏的认知样本（cognitive samples）来提升多模态推理能力，仅需9.3%的训练数据即可实现优于全数据集的性能，并降低43%的计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）需要大量训练数据以提高推理能力，但作者发现真正触发多模态推理的仅是少数高价值样本，其余样本贡献有限。

Method: 提出RAP范式，包含两个互补的估计器：1）基于潜在结果模型的因果差异估计器（CDE），剔除依赖语言先验的样本；2）注意力置信度估计器（ACE），剔除无关但被过度强调的样本。此外，引入难度感知替换模块（DRM）以增强样本复杂性。

Result: 在六个数据集上的实验表明，RAP仅需9.3%的训练数据即可实现优于全数据集的性能，同时降低43%的计算成本。

Conclusion: RAP通过高效数据选择和样本替换，显著提升了多模态推理的效率和性能，挑战了传统依赖大规模数据的假设。

Abstract: While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant
progress in complex reasoning tasks via reinforcement learning, it is commonly
believed that extensive training data is necessary for improving multi-modal
reasoning ability, inevitably leading to data redundancy and substantial
computational costs. However, can smaller high-value datasets match or
outperform full corpora for multi-modal reasoning in MLLMs? In this work, we
challenge this assumption through a key observation: meaningful multi-modal
reasoning is triggered by only a sparse subset of training samples, termed
cognitive samples, whereas the majority contribute marginally. Building on this
insight, we propose a novel data selection paradigm termed Reasoning Activation
Potential (RAP), which identifies cognitive samples by estimating each sample's
potential to stimulate genuine multi-modal reasoning by two complementary
estimators: 1) Causal Discrepancy Estimator (CDE) based on the potential
outcome model principle, eliminates samples that overly rely on language priors
by comparing outputs between multi-modal and text-only inputs; 2) Attention
Confidence Estimator (ACE), which exploits token-level self-attention to
discard samples dominated by irrelevant but over-emphasized tokens in
intermediate reasoning stages. Moreover, we introduce a Difficulty-aware
Replacement Module (DRM) to substitute trivial instances with cognitively
challenging ones, thereby ensuring complexity for robust multi-modal reasoning.
Experiments on six datasets show that our RAP method consistently achieves
superior performance using only 9.3% of the training data, while reducing
computational costs by over 43%. Our code is available at
https://github.com/Leo-ssl/RAP.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的SSIM形式，通过加法而非乘法组合SSIM中的亮度、对比度和结构相似性组件，优化了无监督单目深度学习的训练效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法忽略了SSIM函数中不同组件及超参数对训练的影响，导致性能受限。

Method: 提出了一种新的SSIM形式，用加法替代乘法组合组件，并优化参数组合。

Result: 优化的SSIM损失函数在KITTI-2015数据集上显著优于基线。

Conclusion: 新SSIM形式能生成更平滑的梯度，提升无监督深度估计性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised monocular depth learning generally relies on the photometric
relation among temporally adjacent images. Most of previous works use both mean
absolute error (MAE) and structure similarity index measure (SSIM) with
conventional form as training loss. However, they ignore the effect of
different components in the SSIM function and the corresponding hyperparameters
on the training. To address these issues, this work proposes a new form of
SSIM. Compared with original SSIM function, the proposed new form uses addition
rather than multiplication to combine the luminance, contrast, and structural
similarity related components in SSIM. The loss function constructed with this
scheme helps result in smoother gradients and achieve higher performance on
unsupervised depth estimation. We conduct extensive experiments to determine
the relatively optimal combination of parameters for our new SSIM. Based on the
popular MonoDepth approach, the optimized SSIM loss function can remarkably
outperform the baseline on the KITTI-2015 outdoor dataset.

Method: 采用双曲空间表示层次特征关系，提出层次特征聚合机制和粗到细搜索策略。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上性能优于现有方法，检索速度提升5倍。

Conclusion: HypeVPR通过层次嵌入和高效搜索策略，显著提升了VPR的性能和效率。

Abstract: When applying Visual Place Recognition (VPR) to real-world mobile robots and
similar applications, perspective-to-equirectangular (P2E) formulation
naturally emerges as a suitable approach to accommodate diverse query images
captured from various viewpoints. In this paper, we introduce HypeVPR, a novel
hierarchical embedding framework in hyperbolic space, designed to address the
unique challenges of P2E VPR. The key idea behind HypeVPR is that visual
environments captured by panoramic views exhibit inherent hierarchical
structures. To leverage this property, we employ hyperbolic space to represent
hierarchical feature relationships and preserve distance properties within the
feature space. To achieve this, we propose a hierarchical feature aggregation
mechanism that organizes local-to-global feature representations within
hyperbolic space. Additionally, HypeVPR adopts an efficient coarse-to-fine
search strategy, optimally balancing speed and accuracy to ensure robust
matching, even between descriptors from different image types. This approach
enables HypeVPR to outperform state-of-the-art methods while significantly
reducing retrieval time, achieving up to 5x faster retrieval across diverse
benchmark datasets. The code and models will be released at
https://github.com/suhan-woo/HypeVPR.git.

TL;DR: Object-X是一个多模态3D对象表示框架，能够编码丰富对象嵌入并解码为详细几何和视觉重建，支持多种下游任务，存储需求极低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常针对特定任务设计嵌入，无法同时支持几何重建和跨任务复用，因此需要一种更通用的多模态3D表示框架。

Method: Object-X通过将多模态数据（如图像、点云、文本）几何地嵌入3D体素网格，并学习融合体素与对象属性的非结构化嵌入，支持基于3D高斯泼溅的对象重建。

Result: Object-X在真实数据集上实现了高保真新视角合成和几何精度提升，同时在场景对齐和定位任务中表现优异，存储需求比传统方法低3-4个数量级。

Conclusion: Object-X是一种可扩展且实用的多模态3D场景表示解决方案，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: Learning effective multi-modal 3D representations of objects is essential for
numerous applications, such as augmented reality and robotics. Existing methods
often rely on task-specific embeddings that are tailored either for semantic
understanding or geometric reconstruction. As a result, these embeddings
typically cannot be decoded into explicit geometry and simultaneously reused
across tasks. In this paper, we propose Object-X, a versatile multi-modal
object representation framework capable of encoding rich object embeddings
(e.g. images, point cloud, text) and decoding them back into detailed geometric
and visual reconstructions. Object-X operates by geometrically grounding the
captured modalities in a 3D voxel grid and learning an unstructured embedding
fusing the information from the voxels with the object attributes. The learned
embedding enables 3D Gaussian Splatting-based object reconstruction, while also
supporting a range of downstream tasks, including scene alignment, single-image
3D object reconstruction, and localization. Evaluations on two challenging
real-world datasets demonstrate that Object-X produces high-fidelity novel-view
synthesis comparable to standard 3D Gaussian Splatting, while significantly
improving geometric accuracy. Moreover, Object-X achieves competitive
performance with specialized methods in scene alignment and localization.
Critically, our object-centric descriptors require 3-4 orders of magnitude less
storage compared to traditional image- or point cloud-based approaches,
establishing Object-X as a scalable and highly practical solution for
multi-modal 3D scene representation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ANNS结果可能过于相似，而某些场景需要结果既相似又多样。

Method: 预计算邻近向量表，过滤时贪心查找并删除冗余向量。

Result: 在类似实际RAG应用中，LotusFilter运行速度快（0.02 ms/查询）。

Conclusion: LotusFilter是一种高效的多样化ANNS结果方法，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) is an essential building block for
applications like RAG but can sometimes yield results that are overly similar
to each other. In certain scenarios, search results should be similar to the
query and yet diverse. We propose LotusFilter, a post-processing module to
diversify ANNS results. We precompute a cutoff table summarizing vectors that
are close to each other. During the filtering, LotusFilter greedily looks up
the table to delete redundant vectors from the candidates. We demonstrated that
the LotusFilter operates fast (0.02 [ms/query]) in settings resembling
real-world RAG applications, utilizing features such as OpenAI embeddings. Our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/matsui528/lotf.

TL;DR: SupeRANSAC是一种新型统一的RANSAC流程，旨在提高计算机视觉任务中的鲁棒性估计性能，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RANSAC及其变体在计算机视觉中是几何模型估计的金标准，但性能在不同任务中表现不一，受实现细节和优化影响较大。

Method: 提出SupeRANSAC，分析并整合了使RANSAC在特定视觉任务中有效的技术，如单应性、基础/本质矩阵和绝对/刚性位姿估计。

Result: SupeRANSAC在多个任务和数据集上显著优于现有方法，例如在基础矩阵估计上平均提高6 AUC点。

Conclusion: SupeRANSAC通过统一流程实现了跨任务的高性能，为计算机视觉中的鲁棒性估计提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Robust estimation is a cornerstone in computer vision, particularly for tasks
like Structure-from-Motion and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping. RANSAC
and its variants are the gold standard for estimating geometric models (e.g.,
homographies, relative/absolute poses) from outlier-contaminated data. Despite
RANSAC's apparent simplicity, achieving consistently high performance across
different problems is challenging. While recent research often focuses on
improving specific RANSAC components (e.g., sampling, scoring), overall
performance is frequently more influenced by the "bells and whistles" (i.e.,
the implementation details and problem-specific optimizations) within a given
library. Popular frameworks like OpenCV and PoseLib demonstrate varying
performance, excelling in some tasks but lagging in others. We introduce
SupeRANSAC, a novel unified RANSAC pipeline, and provide a detailed analysis of
the techniques that make RANSAC effective for specific vision tasks, including
homography, fundamental/essential matrix, and absolute/rigid pose estimation.
SupeRANSAC is designed for consistent accuracy across these tasks, improving
upon the best existing methods by, for example, 6 AUC points on average for
fundamental matrix estimation. We demonstrate significant performance
improvements over the state-of-the-art on multiple problems and datasets. Code:

Result: 数据集支持最新标准，类别数量是现有数据集的6倍以上，解决了长尾分布问题。

Conclusion: MegaHan97K为OCR和大类别模式识别提供了新挑战和机遇，可能是目前类别最多的数据集。

Abstract: Foundational to the Chinese language and culture, Chinese characters
encompass extraordinarily extensive and ever-expanding categories, with the
latest Chinese GB18030-2022 standard containing 87,887 categories. The accurate
recognition of this vast number of characters, termed mega-category
recognition, presents a formidable yet crucial challenge for cultural heritage
preservation and digital applications. Despite significant advances in Optical
Character Recognition (OCR), mega-category recognition remains unexplored due
to the absence of comprehensive datasets, with the largest existing dataset
containing merely 16,151 categories. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce
MegaHan97K, a mega-category, large-scale dataset covering an unprecedented
97,455 categories of Chinese characters. Our work offers three major
contributions: (1) MegaHan97K is the first dataset to fully support the latest
GB18030-2022 standard, providing at least six times more categories than
existing datasets; (2) It effectively addresses the long-tail distribution
problem by providing balanced samples across all categories through its three
distinct subsets: handwritten, historical and synthetic subsets; (3)
Comprehensive benchmarking experiments reveal new challenges in mega-category
scenarios, including increased storage demands, morphologically similar
character recognition, and zero-shot learning difficulties, while also
unlocking substantial opportunities for future research. To the best of our
knowledge, the MetaHan97K is likely the dataset with the largest classes not
only in the field of OCR but may also in the broader domain of pattern
recognition. The dataset is available at

Conclusion: Spike-TBR填补了脉冲基和帧基处理之间的空白，为事件驱动视觉应用提供了简单且抗噪的解决方案。

Abstract: Event cameras offer significant advantages over traditional frame-based
sensors, including higher temporal resolution, lower latency and dynamic range.
However, efficiently converting event streams into formats compatible with
standard computer vision pipelines remains a challenging problem, particularly
in the presence of noise. In this paper, we propose Spike-TBR, a novel
event-based encoding strategy based on Temporal Binary Representation (TBR),
addressing its vulnerability to noise by integrating spiking neurons. Spike-TBR
combines the frame-based advantages of TBR with the noise-filtering
capabilities of spiking neural networks, creating a more robust representation
of event streams. We evaluate four variants of Spike-TBR, each using different
spiking neurons, across multiple datasets, demonstrating superior performance
in noise-affected scenarios while improving the results on clean data. Our
method bridges the gap between spike-based and frame-based processing, offering
a simple noise-resilient solution for event-driven vision applications.

a patch placed under it, and describe a training strategy. We demonstrate
successful adversarial patch attacks in universal settings. Our experiments
show realistic targeted red-to-green label-flipping attacks and attacks on

Result: DualX-VSR在真实世界视频超分辨率任务中实现了高保真和卓越性能。

Conclusion: DualX-VSR通过创新的注意力机制，显著提升了视频超分辨率的性能，适用于真实场景。

Abstract: Transformer-based models like ViViT and TimeSformer have advanced video
understanding by effectively modeling spatiotemporal dependencies. Recent video
generation models, such as Sora and Vidu, further highlight the power of
transformers in long-range feature extraction and holistic spatiotemporal
modeling. However, directly applying these models to real-world video
super-resolution (VSR) is challenging, as VSR demands pixel-level precision,
which can be compromised by tokenization and sequential attention mechanisms.
While recent transformer-based VSR models attempt to address these issues using
smaller patches and local attention, they still face limitations such as
restricted receptive fields and dependence on optical flow-based alignment,
which can introduce inaccuracies in real-world settings. To overcome these
issues, we propose Dual Axial Spatial$\times$Temporal Transformer for
Real-World Video Super-Resolution (DualX-VSR), which introduces a novel dual
axial spatial$\times$temporal attention mechanism that integrates spatial and
temporal information along orthogonal directions. DualX-VSR eliminates the need
for motion compensation, offering a simplified structure that provides a
cohesive representation of spatiotemporal information. As a result, DualX-VSR
achieves high fidelity and superior performance in real-world VSR task.

Abstract: Although perception systems have made remarkable advancements in recent
years, particularly in 2D reasoning segmentation, these systems still rely on
explicit human instruction or pre-defined categories to identify target objects
before executing visual recognition tasks. Such systems have matured
significantly, demonstrating the ability to reason and comprehend implicit user
intentions in two-dimensional contexts, producing accurate segmentation masks
based on complex and implicit query text. However, a comparable framework and
structure for 3D reasoning segmentation remain absent. This paper introduces
OpenMaskDINO3D, a LLM designed for comprehensive 3D understanding and
segmentation. OpenMaskDINO3D processes point cloud data and text prompts to
produce instance segmentation masks, excelling in many 3D tasks. By introducing
a SEG token and object identifier, we achieve high-precision 3D segmentation
mask generation, enabling the model to directly produce accurate point cloud
segmentation results from natural language instructions. Experimental results

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in both image generation
and editing. However, recent studies have revealed their vulnerability to
backdoor attacks, in which specific patterns embedded in the input can
manipulate the model's behavior. Most existing research in this area has
proposed attack frameworks focused on the image generation pipeline, leaving
backdoor attacks in image editing relatively unexplored. Among the few studies
targeting image editing, most utilize visible triggers, which are impractical
because they introduce noticeable alterations to the input image before
editing. In this paper, we propose a novel attack framework that embeds
invisible triggers into the image editing process via poisoned training data.
We leverage off-the-shelf deep watermarking models to encode imperceptible
watermarks as backdoor triggers. Our goal is to make the model produce the
predefined backdoor target when it receives watermarked inputs, while editing
clean images normally according to the given prompt. With extensive experiments
across different watermarking models, the proposed method achieves promising
attack success rates. In addition, the analysis results of the watermark
characteristics in term of backdoor attack further support the effectiveness of
our approach. The code is available

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于直觉驱动的规划方法，通过对比学习训练Transformer编码器，将棋盘状态嵌入到潜在空间中，实现无需深度搜索的走子选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代国际象棋引擎依赖深度树搜索和回归评估，而人类玩家则依靠直觉选择候选走法。论文旨在模拟人类的直觉驱动规划过程。

Method: 使用监督对比学习训练Transformer编码器，将棋盘状态嵌入到潜在空间中，距离反映评估相似性，并通过浅层搜索验证走法。

Result: 模型仅使用6层束搜索，估计Elo评分为2593，性能随模型规模和嵌入维度提升而改善。

Conclusion: 潜在空间规划可作为传统搜索的替代方案，方法可推广至其他完美信息游戏。

Abstract: Modern chess engines achieve superhuman performance through deep tree search
and regressive evaluation, while human players rely on intuition to select
candidate moves followed by a shallow search to validate them. To model this
intuition-driven planning process, we train a transformer encoder using
supervised contrastive learning to embed board states into a latent space
structured by positional evaluation. In this space, distance reflects
evaluative similarity, and visualized trajectories display interpretable
transitions between game states. We demonstrate that move selection can occur
entirely within this embedding space by advancing toward favorable regions,
without relying on deep search. Despite using only a 6-ply beam search, our
model achieves an estimated Elo rating of 2593. Performance improves with both
model size and embedding dimensionality, suggesting that latent planning may
offer a viable alternative to traditional search. Although we focus on chess,
the proposed embedding-based planning method can be generalized to other
perfect-information games where state evaluations are learnable. All source

TL;DR: Anywhere3D-Bench是一个新的3D视觉定位基准，涵盖四个层次的任务，揭示了当前模型在空间和部分级别任务上的显著不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索3D场景中超越物体级别的视觉定位能力，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 提出Anywhere3D-Bench基准，评估多种先进方法（包括LLMs和MLLMs）在四个不同层次任务上的表现。

Result: 空间和部分级别任务表现最差，最佳模型OpenAI o4-mini在空间任务上仅23.57%准确率，部分任务33.94%。

Conclusion: 当前模型在3D场景的空间和部分级别理解与推理能力存在显著不足。

Abstract: 3D visual grounding has made notable progress in localizing objects within
complex 3D scenes. However, grounding referring expressions beyond objects in
3D scenes remains unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Anywhere3D-Bench, a
holistic 3D visual grounding benchmark consisting of 2,632 referring
expression-3D bounding box pairs spanning four different grounding levels:
human-activity areas, unoccupied space beyond objects, objects in the scene,
and fine-grained object parts. We assess a range of state-of-the-art 3D visual
grounding methods alongside large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs
(MLLMs) on Anywhere3D-Bench. Experimental results reveal that space-level and
part-level visual grounding pose the greatest challenges: space-level tasks
require a more comprehensive spatial reasoning ability, for example, modeling
distances and spatial relations within 3D space, while part-level tasks demand
fine-grained perception of object composition. Even the best performance model,
OpenAI o4-mini, achieves only 23.57% accuracy on space-level tasks and 33.94%
on part-level tasks, significantly lower than its performance on area-level and
object-level tasks. These findings underscore a critical gap in current models'
capacity to understand and reason about 3D scene beyond object-level semantics.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）的立体数据集生成方法，相比NeRF方法更高效，并探索了利用显式3D重建几何和FoundationStereo模型的深度估计进行知识迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为立体模型提供低成本、高保真的数据集生成方法，并快速微调模型。

Method: 结合3DGS生成的几何和FoundationStereo的深度估计，通过知识迁移生成数据集，并用于微调立体模型。

Result: 3DGS生成的几何噪声较多，而FoundationStereo的视差估计更干净，在零样本泛化基准中表现更好。

Conclusion: 3DGS方法在低成本数据集生成和快速微调方面有潜力，但在复杂场景中的鲁棒性仍需改进。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based pipeline for
stereo dataset generation, offering an efficient alternative to Neural Radiance
Fields (NeRF)-based methods. To obtain useful geometry estimates, we explore
utilizing the reconstructed geometry from the explicit 3D representations as
well as depth estimates from the FoundationStereo model in an expert knowledge
transfer setup. We find that when fine-tuning stereo models on 3DGS-generated
datasets, we demonstrate competitive performance in zero-shot generalization
benchmarks. When using the reconstructed geometry directly, we observe that it
is often noisy and contains artifacts, which propagate noise to the trained
model. In contrast, we find that the disparity estimates from FoundationStereo
are cleaner and consequently result in a better performance on the zero-shot
generalization benchmarks. Our method highlights the potential for low-cost,
high-fidelity dataset creation and fast fine-tuning for deep stereo models.
Moreover, we also reveal that while the latest Gaussian Splatting based methods
have achieved superior performance on established benchmarks, their robustness
falls short in challenging in-the-wild settings warranting further exploration.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了文化遗产数字化中3D摄影方法的多样性，强调应根据对象特性和未来用途选择合适方法，而非追求绝对分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文化遗产数字化需求日益增长，但现有3D数字化方法多样且无统一标准，需根据具体对象和用途灵活选择。

Method: 通过法国国家考古博物馆的藏品案例，分析不同3D摄影方法的适用性，强调跨领域协作选择最佳工具。

Result: 研究表明，没有单一方法适用于所有对象，需结合对象特性和数字化用途定制方法。

Conclusion: 文化遗产数字化应避免绝对分类，而是通过协作选择最适合的工具，以适应不同对象的需求。

Abstract: The need to digitize heritage objects is now widely accepted. This article
presents the very fashionable context of the creation of ''digital twins''. It
illustrates the diversity of photographic 3D digitization methods, but this is
not its only objective. Using a selection of objects from the collections of
the mus{\'e}e d'Arch{\'e}ologie nationale, it shows that no single method is
suitable for all cases. Rather, the method to be recommended for a given object
should be the result of a concerted choice between those involved in heritage
and those involved in the digital domain, as each new object may require the
adaptation of existing tools. It would therefore be pointless to attempt an
absolute classification of 3D digitization methods. On the contrary, we need to
find the digital tool best suited to each object, taking into account not only
its characteristics, but also the future use of its digital twin.

Conclusion: CzechLynx将成为猞猁个体识别和相关任务的重要基准数据集。

Abstract: We introduce CzechLynx, the first large-scale, open-access dataset for
individual identification, 2D pose estimation, and instance segmentation of the
Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx). CzechLynx includes more than 30k camera trap images
annotated with segmentation masks, identity labels, and 20-point skeletons and
covers 219 unique individuals across 15 years of systematic monitoring in two
geographically distinct regions: Southwest Bohemia and the Western Carpathians.
To increase the data variability, we create a complementary synthetic set with
more than 100k photorealistic images generated via a Unity-based pipeline and
diffusion-driven text-to-texture modeling, covering diverse environments,
poses, and coat-pattern variations. To allow testing generalization across
spatial and temporal domains, we define three tailored evaluation
protocols/splits: (i) geo-aware, (ii) time-aware open-set, and (iii) time-aware
closed-set. This dataset is targeted to be instrumental in benchmarking
state-of-the-art models and the development of novel methods for not just
individual animal re-identification.

Conclusion: 该工作为胚胎选择提供了新范式，数据集和代码将公开。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has recently shown promise in automated embryo
selection for In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF). However, current approaches either
address partial embryo evaluation lacking holistic quality assessment or target
clinical outcomes inevitably confounded by extra-embryonic factors, both
limiting clinical utility. To bridge this gap, we propose a new task called
Video-Based Embryo Grading - the first paradigm that directly utilizes
full-length time-lapse monitoring (TLM) videos to predict embryologists'
overall quality assessments. To support this task, we curate a real-world
clinical dataset comprising over 2,500 TLM videos, each annotated with a
grading label indicating the overall quality of embryos. Grounded in clinical
decision-making principles, we propose a Complementary Spatial-Temporal Pattern
Mining (CoSTeM) framework that conceptually replicates embryologists'
evaluation process. The CoSTeM comprises two branches: (1) a morphological
branch using a Mixture of Cross-Attentive Experts layer and a Temporal
Selection Block to select discriminative local structural features, and (2) a
morphokinetic branch employing a Temporal Transformer to model global
developmental trajectories, synergistically integrating static and dynamic
determinants for grading embryos. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
the superiority of our design. This work provides a valuable methodological
framework for AI-assisted embryo selection. The dataset and source code will be
publicly available upon acceptance.

*Igor Meleshin,Anna Chistyakova,Anastasia Antsiferova,Dmitriy Vatolin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过设计而非训练来增强图像质量评估（IQA）模型鲁棒性的方法，通过正交信息流和规范保持操作实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的数据驱动防御方法（如对抗训练）可能不是解决IQA模型鲁棒性的最佳途径，需要从设计层面提升稳定性。

Method: 通过强制正交信息流和规范保持操作重塑模型内部结构，并结合剪枝和微调进一步稳定系统。

Result: 设计出的IQA架构能够抵御对抗攻击，无需对抗训练或对原模型进行大幅修改。

Conclusion: 建议从数据优化转向设计优化，将鲁棒性作为架构的先验条件。

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models are increasingly relied upon to
evaluate image quality in real-world systems -- from compression and
enhancement to generation and streaming. Yet their adoption brings a
fundamental risk: these models are inherently unstable. Adversarial
manipulations can easily fool them, inflating scores and undermining trust.
Traditionally, such vulnerabilities are addressed through data-driven defenses
-- adversarial retraining, regularization, or input purification. But what if
this is the wrong lens? What if robustness in perceptual models is not
something to learn but something to design? In this work, we propose a
provocative idea: robustness as an architectural prior. Rather than training
models to resist perturbations, we reshape their internal structure to suppress
sensitivity from the ground up. We achieve this by enforcing orthogonal
information flow, constraining the network to norm-preserving operations -- and
further stabilizing the system through pruning and fine-tuning. The result is a
robust IQA architecture that withstands adversarial attacks without requiring
adversarial training or significant changes to the original model. This
approach suggests a shift in perspective: from optimizing robustness through
data to engineering it through design.

TL;DR: APVR框架通过分层视觉信息检索解决长视频理解问题，无需训练即可高效处理小时级视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频多模态大语言模型因计算限制和低效信息提取难以处理小时级视频。

Method: APVR采用双组件方法：Pivot Frame Retrieval（语义扩展和多模态置信度评分）和Pivot Token Retrieval（查询感知的注意力驱动令牌选择）。

Result: 在LongVideoBench和VideoMME上验证，性能显著提升，达到SOTA结果。

Conclusion: APVR为长视频理解提供了高效、即插即用的解决方案，兼容现有MLLM架构。

Abstract: Current video-based multimodal large language models struggle with hour-level
video understanding due to computational constraints and inefficient
information extraction from extensive temporal sequences. We propose APVR
(Adaptive Pivot Visual information Retrieval), a training-free framework that
addresses the memory wall limitation through hierarchical visual information
retrieval. APVR operates via two complementary components: Pivot Frame
Retrieval employs semantic expansion and multi-modal confidence scoring to
identify semantically relevant video frames, while Pivot Token Retrieval
performs query-aware attention-driven token selection within the pivot frames.
This dual granularity approach enables processing of hour-long videos while
maintaining semantic fidelity. Experimental validation on LongVideoBench and
VideoMME demonstrates significant performance improvements, establishing
state-of-the-art results for not only training-free but also training-based
approaches while providing plug-and-play integration capability with existing
MLLM architectures.

TL;DR: FEAT是一种高效的全维度注意力Transformer，通过空间-时间-通道注意力机制、线性复杂度设计和残差值引导模块，显著提升了动态医学视频合成的质量和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Transformer方法在动态医学视频合成中存在通道交互不足、计算复杂度高和去噪指导粗糙等问题，亟需改进。

Method: 提出FEAT，采用空间-时间-通道注意力机制、线性复杂度设计和残差值引导模块，优化全局依赖建模和噪声适应能力。

Result: FEAT-S参数仅为Endora的23%，性能相当或更优；FEAT-L在多个数据集上超越所有对比方法。

Conclusion: FEAT在动态医学视频合成中表现出高效性和可扩展性，为相关领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Synthesizing high-quality dynamic medical videos remains a significant
challenge due to the need for modeling both spatial consistency and temporal
dynamics. Existing Transformer-based approaches face critical limitations,
including insufficient channel interactions, high computational complexity from
self-attention, and coarse denoising guidance from timestep embeddings when
handling varying noise levels. In this work, we propose FEAT, a
full-dimensional efficient attention Transformer, which addresses these issues
through three key innovations: (1) a unified paradigm with sequential
spatial-temporal-channel attention mechanisms to capture global dependencies
across all dimensions, (2) a linear-complexity design for attention mechanisms
in each dimension, utilizing weighted key-value attention and global channel
attention, and (3) a residual value guidance module that provides fine-grained
pixel-level guidance to adapt to different noise levels. We evaluate FEAT on
standard benchmarks and downstream tasks, demonstrating that FEAT-S, with only
23\% of the parameters of the state-of-the-art model Endora, achieves
comparable or even superior performance. Furthermore, FEAT-L surpasses all
comparison methods across multiple datasets, showcasing both superior
effectiveness and scalability. Code is available at

Motivation: 传统森林监测方法成本高、耗时长，无人机遥感与计算机视觉技术为大规模单木监测提供了新可能。

Method: 比较了SAM在三种森林类型中的表现，并研究了DSM数据的集成效果，提出了BalSAM模型。

Result: SAM直接使用效果不如定制Mask R-CNN，但结合DSM和端到端调优的BalSAM在种植园场景中表现更优。

Conclusion: 结合DSM和端到端调优的SAM是树冠实例分割的有前景方向。

Abstract: Information on trees at the individual level is crucial for monitoring forest
ecosystems and planning forest management. Current monitoring methods involve
ground measurements, requiring extensive cost, time and labor. Advances in
drone remote sensing and computer vision offer great potential for mapping
individual trees from aerial imagery at broad-scale. Large pre-trained vision
models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), represent a particularly
compelling choice given limited labeled data. In this work, we compare methods
leveraging SAM for the task of automatic tree crown instance segmentation in
high resolution drone imagery in three use cases: 1) boreal plantations, 2)
temperate forests and 3) tropical forests. We also study the integration of
elevation data into models, in the form of Digital Surface Model (DSM)
information, which can readily be obtained at no additional cost from RGB drone
imagery. We present BalSAM, a model leveraging SAM and DSM information, which
shows potential over other methods, particularly in the context of plantations.
We find that methods using SAM out-of-the-box do not outperform a custom Mask
R-CNN, even with well-designed prompts. However, efficiently tuning SAM
end-to-end and integrating DSM information are both promising avenues for tree
crown instance segmentation models.

Conclusion: TextVidBench填补了长视频文本问答基准的空白，提出的方法为改进大模型的长视频理解能力提供了实用方案。

Abstract: Despite recent progress on the short-video Text-Visual Question Answering
(ViteVQA) task - largely driven by benchmarks such as M4-ViteVQA - existing
datasets still suffer from limited video duration and narrow evaluation scopes,
making it difficult to adequately assess the growing capabilities of powerful
multimodal large language models (MLLMs). To address these limitations, we
introduce TextVidBench, the first benchmark specifically designed for
long-video text question answering (>3 minutes). TextVidBench makes three key
contributions: 1) Cross-domain long-video coverage: Spanning 9 categories
(e.g., news, sports, gaming), with an average video length of 2306 seconds,
enabling more realistic evaluation of long-video understanding. 2) A
three-stage evaluation framework: "Text Needle-in-Haystack -> Temporal
Grounding -> Text Dynamics Captioning". 3) High-quality fine-grained
annotations: Containing over 5,000 question-answer pairs with detailed semantic
labeling. Furthermore, we propose an efficient paradigm for improving large
models through: (i) introducing the IT-Rope mechanism and temporal prompt
engineering to enhance temporal perception, (ii) adopting non-uniform
positional encoding to better handle long video sequences, and (iii) applying
lightweight fine-tuning on video-text data. Extensive experiments on multiple
public datasets as well as TextVidBench demonstrate that our new benchmark
presents significant challenges to existing models, while our proposed method
offers valuable insights into improving long-video scene text understanding
capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VARSR方法存在固定分辨率限制、依赖大规模模型和数据集的问题，本文旨在通过改进标记化和优化策略解决这些问题。

Method: 提出两种新组件：1）多尺度图像标记化方法，强制不同尺度间的标记重叠；2）DPO正则化项，仅依赖低分辨率和高分辨率标记化训练模型。

Result: 模型能在单次前向传播中完成超分辨率处理，使用小模型（300M参数）且无需外部数据，达到最优效果。

Conclusion: 通过多尺度标记化和DPO优化，本文方法显著提升了VAR在ISR任务中的性能，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: In this paper we tackle Image Super Resolution (ISR), using recent advances
in Visual Auto-Regressive (VAR) modeling. VAR iteratively estimates the
residual in latent space between gradually increasing image scales, a process
referred to as next-scale prediction. Thus, the strong priors learned during
pre-training align well with the downstream task (ISR). To our knowledge, only
VARSR has exploited this synergy so far, showing promising results. However,
due to the limitations of existing residual quantizers, VARSR works only at a
fixed resolution, i.e. it fails to map intermediate outputs to the
corresponding image scales. Additionally, it relies on a 1B transformer
architecture (VAR-d24), and leverages a large-scale private dataset to achieve
state-of-the-art results. We address these limitations through two novel
components: a) a Hierarchical Image Tokenization approach with a multi-scale
image tokenizer that progressively represents images at different scales while
simultaneously enforcing token overlap across scales, and b) a Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) regularization term that, relying solely on the
LR and HR tokenizations, encourages the transformer to produce the latter over
the former. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a quantizer is
trained to force semantically consistent residuals at different scales, and the
first time that preference-based optimization is used to train a VAR. Using
these two components, our model can denoise the LR image and super-resolve at
half and full target upscale factors in a single forward pass. Additionally, we
achieve \textit{state-of-the-art results on ISR}, while using a small model
(300M params vs ~1B params of VARSR), and without using external training data.

Motivation: 当前视频采样方法破坏了技能评估所需的时间连续性，PATS旨在解决这一问题。

Method: PATS自适应分割视频，确保每个分析片段包含关键动作的完整执行，并在多片段中重复此过程。

Result: 在EgoExo4D基准测试中，PATS在所有视角配置下均优于现有方法，且在动态运动和高精度技能中表现突出。

Conclusion: PATS是一种自适应时间采样方法，显著提升了自动化技能评估的实用性。

Abstract: Automated sports skill assessment requires capturing fundamental movement
patterns that distinguish expert from novice performance, yet current video
sampling methods disrupt the temporal continuity essential for proficiency
evaluation. To this end, we introduce Proficiency-Aware Temporal Sampling
(PATS), a novel sampling strategy that preserves complete fundamental movements
within continuous temporal segments for multi-view skill assessment. PATS
adaptively segments videos to ensure each analyzed portion contains full
execution of critical performance components, repeating this process across
multiple segments to maximize information coverage while maintaining temporal
coherence. Evaluated on the EgoExo4D benchmark with SkillFormer, PATS surpasses
the state-of-the-art accuracy across all viewing configurations (+0.65% to
+3.05%) and delivers substantial gains in challenging domains (+26.22%
bouldering, +2.39% music, +1.13% basketball). Systematic analysis reveals that
PATS successfully adapts to diverse activity characteristics-from
high-frequency sampling for dynamic sports to fine-grained segmentation for
sequential skills-demonstrating its effectiveness as an adaptive approach to
temporal sampling that advances automated skill assessment for real-world
applications.

Conclusion: CSTR-CLIP在多样化文本布局的中文场景文本检索任务中表现优越，数据集和代码将公开以促进相关研究。

Abstract: Chinese scene text retrieval is a practical task that aims to search for
images containing visual instances of a Chinese query text. This task is
extremely challenging because Chinese text often features complex and diverse
layouts in real-world scenes. Current efforts tend to inherit the solution for
English scene text retrieval, failing to achieve satisfactory performance. In
this paper, we establish a Diversified Layout benchmark for Chinese Street View
Text Retrieval (DL-CSVTR), which is specifically designed to evaluate retrieval
performance across various text layouts, including vertical, cross-line, and
partial alignments. To address the limitations in existing methods, we propose
Chinese Scene Text Retrieval CLIP (CSTR-CLIP), a novel model that integrates
global visual information with multi-granularity alignment training. CSTR-CLIP
applies a two-stage training process to overcome previous limitations, such as
the exclusion of visual features outside the text region and reliance on
single-granularity alignment, thereby enabling the model to effectively handle
diverse text layouts. Experiments on existing benchmark show that CSTR-CLIP
outperforms the previous state-of-the-art model by 18.82% accuracy and also
provides faster inference speed. Further analysis on DL-CSVTR confirms the
superior performance of CSTR-CLIP in handling various text layouts. The dataset
and code will be publicly available to facilitate research in Chinese scene
text retrieval.

Method: 论文回顾了多种方法，包括多尺度融合网络、将回归任务重新定义为分类问题、引入额外先验知识以及优化目标函数。最新方法如Depth Anything通过仿射不变损失实现多数据集联合训练。

Result: Depth Anything在零样本单目深度估计中表现领先，能够从未见图像中提取结构信息，生成结构细节丰富的深度图，但在度量深度估计上仍有不足。

Conclusion: 尽管单目深度估计取得了显著进展，但在泛化性和度量深度估计方面仍需进一步研究。Depth Anything展示了在结构信息提取上的优势，但需解决度量深度估计的局限性。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation aims to determine the depth of each pixel from an
RGB image captured by a monocular camera. The development of deep learning has
significantly advanced this field by facilitating the learning of depth
features from some well-annotated datasets
\cite{Geiger_Lenz_Stiller_Urtasun_2013,silberman2012indoor}. Eigen \textit{et
al.} \cite{eigen2014depth} first introduce a multi-scale fusion network for
depth regression. Following this, subsequent improvements have come from
reinterpreting the regression task as a classification problem
\cite{bhat2021adabins,Li_Wang_Liu_Jiang_2022}, incorporating additional priors
\cite{shao2023nddepth,yang2023gedepth}, and developing more effective objective
function \cite{xian2020structure,Yin_Liu_Shen_Yan_2019}. Despite these
advances, generalizing to unseen domains remains a challenge. Recently, several
methods have employed affine-invariant loss to enable multi-dataset joint
training \cite{MiDaS,ZeroDepth,guizilini2023towards,Dany}. Among them, Depth
Anything \cite{Dany} has shown leading performance in zero-shot monocular depth
estimation. While it struggles to estimate accurate metric depth due to the
lack of explicit depth cues, it excels at extracting structural information
from unseen images, producing structure-detailed monocular depth.

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用3D高斯泼溅和高斯不透明度场生成合成数据的管道，用于训练3D点云语义分割模型，无需真实数据即可达到高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 获取和标注真实点云数据成本高且耗时，需要一种经济高效的替代方案。

Method: 结合3DGS和GOF生成合成3D资产，模拟LiDAR生成点云数据，并评估其在PointNet++、PTv3和OACNN模型上的表现。

Result: PTv3模型在仅使用合成数据训练和验证的情况下，mIoU达到91.35%，某些情况下甚至优于真实数据训练的模型。

Conclusion: 合成数据可有效替代真实数据，且模型能泛化到未训练的语义类别。

Abstract: Training neural networks for tasks such as 3D point cloud semantic
segmentation demands extensive datasets, yet obtaining and annotating
real-world point clouds is costly and labor-intensive. This work aims to
introduce a novel pipeline for generating realistic synthetic data, by
leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and Gaussian Opacity Fields (GOF) to
generate 3D assets of multiple different agricultural vehicles instead of using
generic models. These assets are placed in a simulated environment, where the
point clouds are generated using a simulated LiDAR. This is a flexible approach
that allows changing the LiDAR specifications without incurring additional
costs. We evaluated the impact of synthetic data on segmentation models such as
PointNet++, Point Transformer V3, and OACNN, by training and validating the
models only on synthetic data. Remarkably, the PTv3 model had an mIoU of
91.35\%, a noteworthy result given that the model had neither been trained nor
validated on any real data. Further studies even suggested that in certain
scenarios the models trained only on synthetically generated data performed
better than models trained on real-world data. Finally, experiments
demonstrated that the models can generalize across semantic classes, enabling
accurate predictions on mesh models they were never trained on.

TL;DR: UAV4D框架通过结合3D基础模型和人体网格重建模型，解决了无人机单目视频中动态场景重建的挑战，实现了多移动行人场景的光照真实渲染。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态神经渲染方法无法有效处理无人机单目视频中的独特挑战，如俯视角、多移动行人等，且缺乏相关数据集。

Method: 利用3D基础模型和人体网格重建模型重建场景和行人，通过行人-场景接触点解决尺度模糊问题，并结合SMPL模型和背景网格初始化高斯样条以实现整体渲染。

Result: 在三个无人机数据集上测试，PSNR提升1.5 dB，视觉清晰度优于现有方法。

Conclusion: UAV4D在无人机动态场景渲染中表现出色，为复杂场景提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in dynamic neural rendering, existing
methods fail to address the unique challenges posed by UAV-captured scenarios,
particularly those involving monocular camera setups, top-down perspective, and
multiple small, moving humans, which are not adequately represented in existing
datasets. In this work, we introduce UAV4D, a framework for enabling
photorealistic rendering for dynamic real-world scenes captured by UAVs.
Specifically, we address the challenge of reconstructing dynamic scenes with
multiple moving pedestrians from monocular video data without the need for
additional sensors. We use a combination of a 3D foundation model and a human
mesh reconstruction model to reconstruct both the scene background and humans.
We propose a novel approach to resolve the scene scale ambiguity and place both
humans and the scene in world coordinates by identifying human-scene contact
points. Additionally, we exploit the SMPL model and background mesh to
initialize Gaussian splats, enabling holistic scene rendering. We evaluated our
method on three complex UAV-captured datasets: VisDrone, Manipal-UAV, and
Okutama-Action, each with distinct characteristics and 10~50 humans. Our
results demonstrate the benefits of our approach over existing methods in novel
view synthesis, achieving a 1.5 dB PSNR improvement and superior visual
sharpness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统屏幕标注方法效率低且不直观，无法充分利用人工检查员的专业知识。本文旨在通过物理交互方式直接捕捉标注轨迹，提升数据标注的效率和准确性。

Method: 系统使用校准的跟踪指针记录用户在物体上的物理交互，并将其转化为标准标注格式。投影界面提供视觉引导，确保标注的一致性和准确性。

Result: 初步评估表明，系统能有效捕捉详细标注轨迹，并与CVAT集成，优化后续机器学习任务的工作流程。

Conclusion: 该系统填补了人工专业知识和自动化数据生成之间的空白，为非IT专家参与机器学习训练提供了可能，并提升了数据标注的效率和质量。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel physical annotation system designed to generate
training data for automated optical inspection. The system uses pointer-based
in-situ interaction to transfer the valuable expertise of trained inspection
personnel directly into a machine learning (ML) training pipeline. Unlike
conventional screen-based annotation methods, our system captures physical
trajectories and contours directly on the object, providing a more intuitive
and efficient way to label data. The core technology uses calibrated, tracked
pointers to accurately record user input and transform these spatial
interactions into standardised annotation formats that are compatible with
open-source annotation software. Additionally, a simple projector-based
interface projects visual guidance onto the object to assist users during the
annotation process, ensuring greater accuracy and consistency. The proposed
concept bridges the gap between human expertise and automated data generation,
enabling non-IT experts to contribute to the ML training pipeline and
preventing the loss of valuable training samples. Preliminary evaluation
results confirm the feasibility of capturing detailed annotation trajectories
and demonstrate that integration with CVAT streamlines the workflow for
subsequent ML tasks. This paper details the system architecture, calibration
procedures and interface design, and discusses its potential contribution to
future ML data generation for automated optical inspection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlowDirector提出了一种无需反转的视频编辑框架，通过ODE直接演化数据空间，保持时间一致性和结构细节，结合注意力掩码和增强引导策略，实现了高效且连贯的视频编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于反转的方法在视频编辑中常导致时间不一致和结构退化，需要一种无需反转且能保持时空一致性的新方法。

Method: 采用ODE直接演化数据空间，引入注意力掩码机制和增强引导策略，优化编辑过程。

Result: FlowDirector在指令遵循、时间一致性和背景保留方面表现优异，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: FlowDirector为无需反转的高效视频编辑提供了新范式，兼具语义对齐和结构一致性。

Abstract: Text-driven video editing aims to modify video content according to natural
language instructions. While recent training-free approaches have made progress
by leveraging pre-trained diffusion models, they typically rely on
inversion-based techniques that map input videos into the latent space, which
often leads to temporal inconsistencies and degraded structural fidelity. To
address this, we propose FlowDirector, a novel inversion-free video editing
framework. Our framework models the editing process as a direct evolution in
data space, guiding the video via an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) to
smoothly transition along its inherent spatiotemporal manifold, thereby
preserving temporal coherence and structural details. To achieve localized and
controllable edits, we introduce an attention-guided masking mechanism that
modulates the ODE velocity field, preserving non-target regions both spatially
and temporally. Furthermore, to address incomplete edits and enhance semantic
alignment with editing instructions, we present a guidance-enhanced editing
strategy inspired by Classifier-Free Guidance, which leverages differential
signals between multiple candidate flows to steer the editing trajectory toward
stronger semantic alignment without compromising structural consistency.
Extensive experiments across benchmarks demonstrate that FlowDirector achieves
state-of-the-art performance in instruction adherence, temporal consistency,
and background preservation, establishing a new paradigm for efficient and
coherent video editing without inversion.

Conclusion: 未来研究方向包括数据集开发、模型优化和多模态方法整合，以推动越南DAR的进步。

Abstract: Vietnamese document analysis and recognition (DAR) is a crucial field with
applications in digitization, information retrieval, and automation. Despite
advancements in OCR and NLP, Vietnamese text recognition faces unique
challenges due to its complex diacritics, tonal variations, and lack of
large-scale annotated datasets. Traditional OCR methods often struggle with
real-world document variations, while deep learning approaches have shown
promise but remain limited by data scarcity and generalization issues.
Recently, large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models have
demonstrated remarkable improvements in text recognition and document
understanding, offering a new direction for Vietnamese DAR. However, challenges
such as domain adaptation, multimodal learning, and computational efficiency
persist. This survey provide a comprehensive review of existing techniques in
Vietnamese document recognition, highlights key limitations, and explores how
LLMs can revolutionize the field. We discuss future research directions,
including dataset development, model optimization, and the integration of
multimodal approaches for improved document intelligence. By addressing these
gaps, we aim to foster advancements in Vietnamese DAR and encourage
community-driven solutions.

Conclusion: SeedEdit 3.0 在多个方面取得了最佳平衡，显著提升了图像编辑的实用性和性能。

Abstract: We introduce SeedEdit 3.0, in companion with our T2I model Seedream 3.0 [22],
which significantly improves over our previous version [27] in both aspects of
edit instruction following and image content (e.g., ID/IP) preservation on real
image inputs. Additional to model upgrading with T2I, in this report, we
present several key improvements. First, we develop an enhanced data curation
pipeline with a meta-info paradigm and meta-info embedding strategy that help
mix images from multiple data sources. This allows us to scale editing data
effectively, and meta information is helpfult to connect VLM with diffusion
model more closely. Second, we introduce a joint learning pipeline for
computing a diffusion loss and a reward loss. Finally, we evaluate SeedEdit 3.0
on our testing benchmarks, for real image editing, where it achieves a best
trade-off between multiple aspects, yielding a high usability rate of 56.1%,
compared to SeedEdit 1.6 (38.4%), GPT4o (37.1%) and Gemini 2.0 (30.3%).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种多模态街道评估框架（MSEF），结合视觉和语言模型，用于评估街道景观的客观特征和主观感知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的街道指标无法充分捕捉主观感知，而这对包容性城市设计至关重要。

Method: 研究融合了视觉变换器（VisualGLM-6B）和大型语言模型（GPT-4），利用15,000多张标注的街景图像进行微调。

Result: 模型在客观特征上F1得分为0.84，与居民感知的一致性达89.3%，并揭示了情境依赖的矛盾和非线性模式。

Conclusion: MSEF为城市感知建模提供了方法创新，并有助于规划系统平衡基础设施精确性与居民体验。

Abstract: While objective street metrics derived from imagery or GIS have become
standard in urban analytics, they remain insufficient to capture subjective
perceptions essential to inclusive urban design. This study introduces a novel
Multimodal Street Evaluation Framework (MSEF) that fuses a vision transformer
(VisualGLM-6B) with a large language model (GPT-4), enabling interpretable
dual-output assessment of streetscapes. Leveraging over 15,000 annotated
street-view images from Harbin, China, we fine-tune the framework using LoRA
and P-Tuning v2 for parameter-efficient adaptation. The model achieves an F1
score of 0.84 on objective features and 89.3 percent agreement with aggregated
resident perceptions, validated across stratified socioeconomic geographies.
Beyond classification accuracy, MSEF captures context-dependent contradictions:
for instance, informal commerce boosts perceived vibrancy while simultaneously
reducing pedestrian comfort. It also identifies nonlinear and semantically
contingent patterns -- such as the divergent perceptual effects of
architectural transparency across residential and commercial zones -- revealing
the limits of universal spatial heuristics. By generating natural-language
rationales grounded in attention mechanisms, the framework bridges sensory data
with socio-affective inference, enabling transparent diagnostics aligned with
SDG 11. This work offers both methodological innovation in urban perception
modeling and practical utility for planning systems seeking to reconcile
infrastructural precision with lived experience.

Motivation: 现有加速方法依赖启发式规则，适用性有限，而vDiT的高计算需求限制了实际部署。

Method: 提出轻量级令牌选择机制和内存高效的GPU并行稀疏注意力策略，结合进化算法自动优化令牌预算分配。

Result: 在单GPU上实现2.4倍推理加速（8GPU可达13.2倍），VBench评分损失低于0.5%。

Conclusion: ASTRAEA在显著提升速度的同时，保持了视频生成质量，为vDiT的实用化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Video diffusion transformers (vDiTs) have made impressive progress in
text-to-video generation, but their high computational demands present major
challenges for practical deployment. While existing acceleration methods reduce
workload at various granularities, they often rely on heuristics, limiting
their applicability.
  We introduce ASTRAEA, an automatic framework that searches for near-optimal
configurations for vDiT-based video generation. At its core, ASTRAEA proposes a
lightweight token selection mechanism and a memory-efficient, GPU-parallel
sparse attention strategy, enabling linear reductions in execution time with
minimal impact on generation quality. To determine optimal token reduction for
different timesteps, we further design a search framework that leverages a
classic evolutionary algorithm to automatically determine the distribution of
the token budget effectively. Together, ASTRAEA achieves up to 2.4x inference
speedup on a single GPU with great scalability (up to 13.2x speedup on 8 GPUs)
while retaining better video quality compared to the state-of-the-art methods
(<0.5% loss on the VBench score compared to the baseline vDiT models).

TL;DR: 论文提出了DIM-CIM框架，用于无参考地测量文本到图像模型的多样性和泛化能力，并通过COCO-DIMCIM基准测试发现模型规模扩大可能牺牲默认模式多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像模型在质量和一致性上取得了显著进展，但牺牲了多样性。现有的自动评估方法要么需要参考数据集，要么缺乏对多样性类型的明确测量，限制了其适应性和可解释性。

Method: 提出了DIM-CIM框架，通过‘Does-it/Can-it’方法测量默认模式多样性和泛化能力，并构建了COCO-DIMCIM基准测试。

Result: 发现模型从1.5B扩展到8.1B参数时，泛化能力提升但默认模式多样性下降；DIM-CIM还能识别细粒度失败案例。训练数据多样性与默认模式多样性相关性为0.85。

Conclusion: DIM-CIM提供了一个灵活且可解释的框架，用于全面评估文本到图像模型的多样性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models have achieved impressive
quality and consistency. However, this has come at the cost of representation
diversity. While automatic evaluation methods exist for benchmarking model
diversity, they either require reference image datasets or lack specificity
about the kind of diversity measured, limiting their adaptability and
interpretability. To address this gap, we introduce the Does-it/Can-it
framework, DIM-CIM, a reference-free measurement of default-mode diversity
("Does" the model generate images with expected attributes?) and generalization
capacity ("Can" the model generate diverse attributes for a particular
concept?). We construct the COCO-DIMCIM benchmark, which is seeded with COCO
concepts and captions and augmented by a large language model. With
COCO-DIMCIM, we find that widely-used models improve in generalization at the
cost of default-mode diversity when scaling from 1.5B to 8.1B parameters.
DIMCIM also identifies fine-grained failure cases, such as attributes that are
generated with generic prompts but are rarely generated when explicitly
requested. Finally, we use DIMCIM to evaluate the training data of a T2I model
and observe a correlation of 0.85 between diversity in training images and
default-mode diversity. Our work provides a flexible and interpretable
framework for assessing T2I model diversity and generalization, enabling a more
comprehensive understanding of model performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度伪造检测模型在非理想条件下性能不稳定，容易被规避。受图像超分辨率领域启发，作者希望通过更全面的伪造模型提升检测器的鲁棒性。

Method: 开发了PMM模型，利用泊松混合、多样化掩码、生成器伪影和干扰物扩展伪造空间，并在训练图像中添加强退化以增强检测器的泛化能力。

Result: 在DFDC和DFDCP数据集上，AUC分别提升了3.51%和6.21%，显著提高了模型对常见图像退化的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PMM模型有效提升了深度伪造检测的鲁棒性和性能，同时揭示了以往检测器的不足。

Abstract: Modern deepfake detection models have achieved strong performance even on the
challenging cross-dataset task. However, detection performance under non-ideal
conditions remains very unstable, limiting success on some benchmark datasets
and making it easy to circumvent detection. Inspired by the move to a more
real-world degradation model in the area of image super-resolution, we have
developed a Practical Manipulation Model (PMM) that covers a larger set of
possible forgeries. We extend the space of pseudo-fakes by using Poisson
blending, more diverse masks, generator artifacts, and distractors.
Additionally, we improve the detectors' generality and robustness by adding
strong degradations to the training images. We demonstrate that these changes
not only significantly enhance the model's robustness to common image
degradations but also improve performance on standard benchmark datasets.
Specifically, we show clear increases of $3.51\%$ and $6.21\%$ AUC on the DFDC
and DFDCP datasets, respectively, over the s-o-t-a LAA backbone. Furthermore,
we highlight the lack of robustness in previous detectors and our improvements
in this regard. Code can be found at https://github.com/BenediktHopf/PMM

Motivation: 研究VLMs对场景结构和语义的理解能力，填补标准化系统评估的空白。

Method: 引入CIVET框架，通过受控刺激系统评估五种先进VLMs的性能。

Result: VLMs仅能准确识别有限的基本物体属性，表现受物体位置影响，且难以理解物体间关系，远低于人类水平。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs在场景理解能力上仍有显著不足，需进一步改进。

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved competitive performance in
various tasks, their comprehension of the underlying structure and semantics of
a scene remains understudied. To investigate the understanding of VLMs, we
study their capability regarding object properties and relations in a
controlled and interpretable manner. To this scope, we introduce CIVET, a novel
and extensible framework for systematiC evaluatIon Via controllEd sTimuli.
CIVET addresses the lack of standardized systematic evaluation for assessing
VLMs' understanding, enabling researchers to test hypotheses with statistical
rigor. With CIVET, we evaluate five state-of-the-art VLMs on exhaustive sets of
stimuli, free from annotation noise, dataset-specific biases, and uncontrolled
scene complexity. Our findings reveal that 1) current VLMs can accurately
recognize only a limited set of basic object properties; 2) their performance
heavily depends on the position of the object in the scene; 3) they struggle to
understand basic relations among objects. Furthermore, a comparative evaluation
with human annotators reveals that VLMs still fall short of achieving
human-level accuracy.

Abstract: Small, fast, and lightweight drones present significant challenges for
traditional RGB cameras due to their limitations in capturing fast-moving
objects, especially under challenging lighting conditions. Event cameras offer
an ideal solution, providing high temporal definition and dynamic range, yet
existing benchmarks often lack fine temporal resolution or drone-specific
motion patterns, hindering progress in these areas. This paper introduces the
Florence RGB-Event Drone dataset (FRED), a novel multimodal dataset
specifically designed for drone detection, tracking, and trajectory
forecasting, combining RGB video and event streams. FRED features more than 7
hours of densely annotated drone trajectories, using 5 different drone models
and including challenging scenarios such as rain and adverse lighting
conditions. We provide detailed evaluation protocols and standard metrics for
each task, facilitating reproducible benchmarking. The authors hope FRED will
advance research in high-speed drone perception and multimodal spatiotemporal
understanding.

Abstract: After a few years of research in the field of through-the-wall radar (TWR)
human activity recognition (HAR), I found that we seem to be stuck in the
mindset of training on radar image data through neural network models. The
earliest related works in this field based on template matching did not require
a training process, and I believe they have never died. Because these methods
possess a strong physical interpretability and are closer to the basis of
theoretical signal processing research. In this paper, I would like to try to
return to the original path by attempting to eschew neural networks to achieve
the TWR HAR task and challenge to achieve intelligent recognition as neural
network models. In detail, the range-time map and Doppler-time map of TWR are
first generated. Then, the initial regions of the human target foreground and
noise background on the maps are determined using corner detection method, and
the micro-Doppler signature is segmented using the multiphase active contour
model. The micro-Doppler segmentation feature is discretized into a
two-dimensional point cloud. Finally, the topological similarity between the
resulting point cloud and the point clouds of the template data is calculated
using Mapper algorithm to obtain the recognition results. The effectiveness of
the proposed method is demonstrated by numerical simulated and measured
experiments. The open-source code of this work is released at:

TL;DR: TAO框架提出了一种细粒度视频异常检测方法，通过像素级跟踪异常对象，避免了阈值调优，提升了检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多关注异常帧或对象，忽略像素级分析，限制了异常检测的广度和精度。

Method: 提出TAO框架，将多粒度异常对象检测统一，通过像素级跟踪异常对象，结合分割与跟踪任务。

Result: 实验表明TAO在准确性和鲁棒性上达到新标杆。

Conclusion: TAO为视频异常检测提供了一种更精确、无需阈值调优的统一解决方案。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial in scenarios such as surveillance
and autonomous driving, where timely detection of unexpected activities is
essential. Although existing methods have primarily focused on detecting
anomalous objects in videos -- either by identifying anomalous frames or
objects -- they often neglect finer-grained analysis, such as anomalous pixels,
which limits their ability to capture a broader range of anomalies. To address
this challenge, we propose a new framework called Track Any Anomalous Object
(TAO), which introduces a granular video anomaly detection pipeline that, for
the first time, integrates the detection of multiple fine-grained anomalous
objects into a unified framework. Unlike methods that assign anomaly scores to
every pixel, our approach transforms the problem into pixel-level tracking of
anomalous objects. By linking anomaly scores to downstream tasks such as
segmentation and tracking, our method removes the need for threshold tuning and
achieves more precise anomaly localization in long and complex video sequences.
Experiments demonstrate that TAO sets new benchmarks in accuracy and
robustness. Project page available online.

TL;DR: TAPFM提出了一种单GPU任务适配方法，用于优化病理基础模型（PFMs）的适应性和性能，通过视觉Transformer注意力机制和多实例学习（MIL）聚合，显著提升了临床任务的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管病理基础模型（PFMs）在分析全切片图像（WSIs）方面表现出色，但如何针对特定临床任务进行有效适配仍面临挑战，尤其是仅能获取弱标签（WSI级别）的情况下。

Method: TAPFM结合视觉Transformer（ViT）注意力机制和多实例学习（MIL）聚合，优化特征表示和注意力权重，同时保持MIL聚合器和PFM的独立计算图以实现稳定训练。

Result: 在膀胱癌和肺腺癌的突变预测任务中，TAPFM表现优于传统方法，尤其在多标签分类任务中效果显著。

Conclusion: TAPFM为在标准硬件上高效适配预训练PFM提供了实用解决方案，适用于多种临床应用。

Abstract: Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
analyzing whole slide images (WSIs). However, adapting these pretrained PFMs
for specific clinical tasks presents considerable challenges, primarily due to
the availability of only weak (WSI-level) labels for gigapixel images,
necessitating multiple instance learning (MIL) paradigm for effective WSI
analysis. This paper proposes a novel approach for single-GPU \textbf{T}ask
\textbf{A}daptation of \textbf{PFM}s (TAPFM) that uses vision transformer
(\vit) attention for MIL aggregation while optimizing both for feature
representations and attention weights. The proposed approach maintains separate
computational graphs for MIL aggregator and the PFM to create stable training
dynamics that align with downstream task objectives during end-to-end
adaptation. Evaluated on mutation prediction tasks for bladder cancer and lung
adenocarcinoma across institutional and TCGA cohorts, TAPFM consistently
outperforms conventional approaches, with H-Optimus-0 (TAPFM) outperforming the
benchmarks. TAPFM effectively handles multi-label classification of actionable
mutations as well. Thus, TAPFM makes adaptation of powerful pre-trained PFMs
practical on standard hardware for various clinical applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多模态低秩适配方法（MokA），针对当前高效多模态微调方法的局限性，通过模态特定参数压缩单模态信息并增强跨模态交互，显著提升了多模态场景下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前高效多模态微调方法多直接借鉴自LLMs，忽视了多模态场景的固有差异，导致无法充分利用所有模态。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出MokA方法，通过模态特定参数压缩单模态信息，并显式增强跨模态交互，实现单模态和跨模态适配。

Result: 在多种多模态场景（如视听文本、视觉文本、语音文本）和LLM骨干网络上均取得一致改进，验证了方法的有效性和通用性。

Conclusion: MokA为多模态语言模型的高效适配提供了更针对性的解决方案，为未来研究铺平了道路。

Abstract: In this paper, we reveal that most current efficient multimodal fine-tuning
methods are hindered by a key limitation: they are directly borrowed from LLMs,
often neglecting the intrinsic differences of multimodal scenarios and even
affecting the full utilization of all modalities. Inspired by our empirical
observation, we argue that unimodal adaptation and cross-modal adaptation are
two essential parts for the effective fine-tuning of MLLMs. From this
perspective, we propose Multimodal low-rank Adaptation (MokA), a
multimodal-aware efficient fine-tuning strategy that takes multimodal
characteristics into consideration. It compresses unimodal information by
modality-specific parameters while explicitly enhancing cross-modal
interaction, ensuring both unimodal and cross-modal adaptation. Extensive
experiments cover three representative multimodal scenarios (audio-visual-text,
visual-text, and speech-text), and multiple LLM backbones (LLaMA2/3, Qwen2,
Qwen2.5-VL, etc). Consistent improvements indicate the efficacy and versatility
of the proposed method. Ablation studies and efficiency evaluation are also
conducted to fully asses our method. Overall, we think MokA provides a more
targeted solution for efficient adaptation of MLLMs, paving the way for further
exploration. The project page is at https://gewu-lab.github.io/MokA.

Motivation: 毫米波通信在非视距条件下可靠性低，尤其在城市或基础设施有限的环境中，军事和民用应用面临挑战。

Method: 系统利用单目相机检测ArUco标记，估计到达角，并实时调整反射器方向，以优化信号重定向。

Conclusion: 该系统在复杂动态环境中展现出毫米波通信的韧性和适应性潜力。

Abstract: Reliable millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication in non-line-of-sight (NLoS)
conditions remains a major challenge for both military and civilian operations,
especially in urban or infrastructure-limited environments. This paper presents
a vision-aided autonomous reflector system designed to enhance mmWave link
performance by dynamically steering signal reflections using a motorized
metallic plate. The proposed system leverages a monocular camera to detect
ArUco markers on allied transmitter and receiver nodes, estimate their angles
of arrival, and align the reflector in real time for optimal signal
redirection. This approach enables selective beam coverage by serving only
authenticated targets with visible markers and reduces the risk of unintended
signal exposure. The designed prototype, built on a Raspberry Pi 4 and
low-power hardware, operates autonomously without reliance on external
infrastructure or GPS. Experimental results at 60\,GHz demonstrate a 23\,dB
average gain in received signal strength and an 0.89 probability of maintaining
signal reception above a target threshold of -65 dB in an indoor environment,
far exceeding the static and no-reflector baselines. These results demonstrate
the system's potential for resilient and adaptive mmWave connectivity in
complex and dynamic environments.

Conclusion: 研究为未来开发更鲁棒的多模态学习技术提供了启示，并提出了改善跨模态传递性的基线方法。

Abstract: Understanding what and how neural networks memorize during training is
crucial, both from the perspective of unintentional memorization of potentially
sensitive information and from the standpoint of effective knowledge
acquisition for real-world, knowledge-intensive tasks. While previous studies
primarily investigate memorization within a single modality, such as text
memorization in large language models or image memorization in diffusion
models, unified multimodal models are becoming increasingly prevalent in
practical applications. In this work, we focus on the unique characteristics of
cross-modality memorization and conduct a systematic study centered on
vision-language models. To facilitate controlled experiments, we first
introduce a synthetic persona dataset comprising diverse synthetic person
images and textual descriptions. We quantify factual knowledge memorization and
cross-modal transferability by training models on a single modality and
evaluating their performance in the other. Our results reveal that facts
learned in one modality transfer to the other, but a significant gap exists
between recalling information in the source and target modalities. Furthermore,
we observe that this gap exists across various scenarios, including more
capable models, machine unlearning, and the multi-hop case. At the end, we
propose a baseline method to mitigate this challenge. We hope our study can
inspire future research on developing more robust multimodal learning
techniques to enhance cross-modal transferability.

Method: 提出DEGround框架，共享DETR查询用于检测和定位，并引入区域激活模块和查询调制模块以增强语言指令的上下文理解。

Result: DEGround在EmbodiedScan验证集上的整体准确率比BIP3D模型高出7.52%。

Conclusion: 研究表明检测模型对3D定位任务有显著帮助，DEGround框架通过结合检测与定位任务，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Embodied 3D grounding aims to localize target objects described in human
instructions from ego-centric viewpoint. Most methods typically follow a
two-stage paradigm where a trained 3D detector's optimized backbone parameters
are used to initialize a grounding model. In this study, we explore a
fundamental question: Does embodied 3D grounding benefit enough from detection?
To answer this question, we assess the grounding performance of detection
models using predicted boxes filtered by the target category. Surprisingly,
these detection models without any instruction-specific training outperform the
grounding models explicitly trained with language instructions. This indicates
that even category-level embodied 3D grounding may not be well resolved, let
alone more fine-grained context-aware grounding. Motivated by this finding, we
propose DEGround, which shares DETR queries as object representation for both
DEtection and Grounding and enables the grounding to benefit from basic
category classification and box detection. Based on this framework, we further
introduce a regional activation grounding module that highlights
instruction-related regions and a query-wise modulation module that
incorporates sentence-level semantic into the query representation,
strengthening the context-aware understanding of language instructions.
Remarkably, DEGround outperforms state-of-the-art model BIP3D by 7.52\% at
overall accuracy on the EmbodiedScan validation set. The source code will be
publicly available at https://github.com/zyn213/DEGround.

Motivation: 现有方法需要密集输入视图且计算成本高，而通用方法难以重建输入视图锥之外的区域。

Method: 利用开放高斯的语义属性作为先验，结合RGB-语义一致修复模块和双向扩散模型控制，逐步优化高斯参数。

Result: OGGSplat在语义和生成质量上表现优异，并在智能手机拍摄的两视图图像上展示了语义感知重建能力。

Conclusion: OGGSplat为稀疏视图下的语义感知3D重建提供了高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing semantic-aware 3D scenes from sparse views is a challenging
yet essential research direction, driven by the demands of emerging
applications such as virtual reality and embodied AI. Existing per-scene
optimization methods require dense input views and incur high computational
costs, while generalizable approaches often struggle to reconstruct regions
outside the input view cone. In this paper, we propose OGGSplat, an open
Gaussian growing method that expands the field-of-view in generalizable 3D
reconstruction. Our key insight is that the semantic attributes of open
Gaussians provide strong priors for image extrapolation, enabling both semantic
consistency and visual plausibility. Specifically, once open Gaussians are
initialized from sparse views, we introduce an RGB-semantic consistent
inpainting module applied to selected rendered views. This module enforces
bidirectional control between an image diffusion model and a semantic diffusion
model. The inpainted regions are then lifted back into 3D space for efficient
and progressive Gaussian parameter optimization. To evaluate our method, we
establish a Gaussian Outpainting (GO) benchmark that assesses both semantic and
generative quality of reconstructed open-vocabulary scenes. OGGSplat also
demonstrates promising semantic-aware scene reconstruction capabilities when
provided with two view images captured directly from a smartphone camera.

Conclusion: Follow-Your-Motion框架有效解决了运动迁移中的一致性和效率问题，并通过基准测试验证了其优势。

Abstract: Recently, breakthroughs in the video diffusion transformer have shown
remarkable capabilities in diverse motion generations. As for the
motion-transfer task, current methods mainly use two-stage Low-Rank Adaptations
(LoRAs) finetuning to obtain better performance. However, existing
adaptation-based motion transfer still suffers from motion inconsistency and
tuning inefficiency when applied to large video diffusion transformers. Naive
two-stage LoRA tuning struggles to maintain motion consistency between
generated and input videos due to the inherent spatial-temporal coupling in the
3D attention operator. Additionally, they require time-consuming fine-tuning
processes in both stages. To tackle these issues, we propose
Follow-Your-Motion, an efficient two-stage video motion transfer framework that
finetunes a powerful video diffusion transformer to synthesize complex
motion.Specifically, we propose a spatial-temporal decoupled LoRA to decouple
the attention architecture for spatial appearance and temporal motion
processing. During the second training stage, we design the sparse motion
sampling and adaptive RoPE to accelerate the tuning speed. To address the lack
of a benchmark for this field, we introduce MotionBench, a comprehensive
benchmark comprising diverse motion, including creative camera motion, single
object motion, multiple object motion, and complex human motion. We show
extensive evaluations on MotionBench to verify the superiority of
Follow-Your-Motion.

Conclusion: DSG-World为真实世界3D重建和模拟提供了一种高效且一致的方法。

Abstract: Building an efficient and physically consistent world model from limited
observations is a long standing challenge in vision and robotics. Many existing
world modeling pipelines are based on implicit generative models, which are
hard to train and often lack 3D or physical consistency. On the other hand,
explicit 3D methods built from a single state often require multi-stage
processing-such as segmentation, background completion, and inpainting-due to
occlusions. To address this, we leverage two perturbed observations of the same
scene under different object configurations. These dual states offer
complementary visibility, alleviating occlusion issues during state transitions
and enabling more stable and complete reconstruction. In this paper, we present
DSG-World, a novel end-to-end framework that explicitly constructs a 3D
Gaussian World model from Dual State observations. Our approach builds dual
segmentation-aware Gaussian fields and enforces bidirectional photometric and
semantic consistency. We further introduce a pseudo intermediate state for
symmetric alignment and design collaborative co-pruning trategies to refine
geometric completeness. DSG-World enables efficient real-to-simulation transfer
purely in the explicit Gaussian representation space, supporting high-fidelity
rendering and object-level scene manipulation without relying on dense
observations or multi-stage pipelines. Extensive experiments demonstrate strong
generalization to novel views and scene states, highlighting the effectiveness
of our approach for real-world 3D reconstruction and simulation.

Motivation: 解决传统文档解析方法（如模块化或多模态大模型）的复杂性和低效问题。

Method: 采用SRR范式，将文档解析分解为结构、识别和关系三个问题，分别对应布局分析、内容识别和逻辑排序。

Result: 在MonkeyDoc数据集上，MonkeyOCR性能优于现有方法（如MinerU和Qwen2.5-VL），尤其在公式和表格处理上表现突出，且推理速度更快。

Conclusion: MonkeyOCR通过SRR范式实现了高效、精确的文档解析，适用于多语言和多类型文档，且资源需求低。

Abstract: We introduce MonkeyOCR, a vision-language model for document parsing that
advances the state of the art by leveraging a Structure-Recognition-Relation
(SRR) triplet paradigm. This design simplifies what would otherwise be a
complex multi-tool pipeline (as in MinerU's modular approach) and avoids the
inefficiencies of processing full pages with giant end-to-end models (e.g.,
large multimodal LLMs like Qwen-VL). In SRR, document parsing is abstracted
into three fundamental questions - "Where is it?" (structure), "What is it?"
(recognition), and "How is it organized?" (relation) - corresponding to layout
analysis, content identification, and logical ordering. This focused
decomposition balances accuracy and speed: it enables efficient, scalable
processing without sacrificing precision. To train and evaluate this approach,
we introduce the MonkeyDoc (the most comprehensive document parsing dataset to
date), with 3.9 million instances spanning over ten document types in both
Chinese and English. Experiments show that MonkeyOCR outperforms MinerU by an
average of 5.1%, with particularly notable improvements on challenging content
such as formulas (+15.0%) and tables (+8.6%). Remarkably, our 3B-parameter
model surpasses much larger and top-performing models, including Qwen2.5-VL
(72B) and Gemini 2.5 Pro, achieving state-of-the-art average performance on
English document parsing tasks. In addition, MonkeyOCR processes multi-page
documents significantly faster (0.84 pages per second compared to 0.65 for
MinerU and 0.12 for Qwen2.5-VL-7B). The 3B model can be efficiently deployed
for inference on a single NVIDIA 3090 GPU. Code and models will be released at

Motivation: SAM在医学图像分割中适应性不足，现有方法如MedSAM牺牲了泛化能力。

Method: 提出了SAM-TTA框架，包括SBCT（自适应转换输入）和DUMT（一致性学习对齐语义）。

Result: 在五个公开数据集上表现优异，甚至超过完全微调的模型。

Conclusion: SAM-TTA为通用医学图像分割提供了新范式。

Abstract: Universal medical image segmentation using the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
remains challenging due to its limited adaptability to medical domains.
Existing adaptations, such as MedSAM, enhance SAM's performance in medical
imaging but at the cost of reduced generalization to unseen data. Therefore, in
this paper, we propose SAM-aware Test-Time Adaptation (SAM-TTA), a
fundamentally different pipeline that preserves the generalization of SAM while
improving its segmentation performance in medical imaging via a test-time
framework. SAM-TTA tackles two key challenges: (1) input-level discrepancies
caused by differences in image acquisition between natural and medical images
and (2) semantic-level discrepancies due to fundamental differences in object
definition between natural and medical domains (e.g., clear boundaries vs.
ambiguous structures). Specifically, our SAM-TTA framework comprises (1)
Self-adaptive Bezier Curve-based Transformation (SBCT), which adaptively
converts single-channel medical images into three-channel SAM-compatible inputs
while maintaining structural integrity, to mitigate the input gap between
medical and natural images, and (2) Dual-scale Uncertainty-driven Mean Teacher
adaptation (DUMT), which employs consistency learning to align SAM's internal
representations to medical semantics, enabling efficient adaptation without
auxiliary supervision or expensive retraining. Extensive experiments on five
public datasets demonstrate that our SAM-TTA outperforms existing TTA
approaches and even surpasses fully fine-tuned models such as MedSAM in certain
scenarios, establishing a new paradigm for universal medical image
segmentation. Code can be found at https://github.com/JianghaoWu/SAM-TTA.

Conclusion: MoViX在跨环境和平台下表现出强大的泛化能力，无需特定环境调优。

Abstract: Robust cross-view 3-DoF localization in GPS-denied, off-road environments
remains challenging due to (1) perceptual ambiguities from repetitive
vegetation and unstructured terrain, and (2) seasonal shifts that significantly
alter scene appearance, hindering alignment with outdated satellite imagery. To
address this, we introduce MoViX, a self-supervised cross-view video
localization framework that learns viewpoint- and season-invariant
representations while preserving directional awareness essential for accurate
localization. MoViX employs a pose-dependent positive sampling strategy to
enhance directional discrimination and temporally aligned hard negative mining
to discourage shortcut learning from seasonal cues. A motion-informed frame
sampler selects spatially diverse frames, and a lightweight temporal aggregator
emphasizes geometrically aligned observations while downweighting ambiguous
ones. At inference, MoViX runs within a Monte Carlo Localization framework,
using a learned cross-view matching module in place of handcrafted models.
Entropy-guided temperature scaling enables robust multi-hypothesis tracking and
confident convergence under visual ambiguity. We evaluate MoViX on the
TartanDrive 2.0 dataset, training on under 30 minutes of data and testing over
12.29 km. Despite outdated satellite imagery, MoViX localizes within 25 meters
of ground truth 93% of the time, and within 50 meters 100% of the time in
unseen regions, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines without
environment-specific tuning. We further demonstrate generalization on a
real-world off-road dataset from a geographically distinct site with a
different robot platform.

Abstract: Most Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) adopt preference alignment
techniques, e.g., DPO~\citep{rafailov2024dpo}, to optimize the reward margin
between a winning response ($y_w$) and a losing response ($y_l$). However, the
likelihood displacement observed in DPO indicates that both $\log \pi_\theta
(y_w\mid x)$ and $\log \pi_\theta (y_l\mid x) $ often decrease during training,
inadvertently boosting the probabilities of non-target responses. In this
paper, we systematically revisit this phenomenon from LLMs to Video-LLMs,
showing that it intensifies when dealing with the redundant complexity of video
content. To alleviate the impact of this phenomenon, we propose \emph{Lean
Preference Optimization} (LeanPO), a reference-free approach that reformulates
the implicit reward as the average likelihood of the response with respect to
the policy model. A key component of LeanPO is the reward-trustworthiness
correlated self-generated preference data pipeline, which carefully infuses
relevant prior knowledge into the model while continuously refining the
preference data via self-reflection. This allows the policy model to obtain
high-quality paired data and accurately estimate the newly defined reward, thus
mitigating the unintended drop. In addition, we introduce a dynamic label
smoothing strategy that mitigates the impact of noise in responses from diverse
video content, preventing the model from overfitting to spurious details.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that LeanPO significantly enhances the
performance of state-of-the-art Video-LLMs, consistently boosting baselines of
varying capacities with minimal additional training overhead. Moreover, LeanPO
offers a simple yet effective solution for aligning Video-LLM preferences with
human trustworthiness, paving the way toward the reliable and efficient
Video-LLMs.

### [99] [Can Foundation Models Generalise the Presentation Attack Detection Capabilities on ID Cards?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05263)
*Juan E. Tapia,Christoph Busch*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何利用基础模型（FM）提升ID卡展示攻击检测（PAD）的泛化能力，特别是在面对多国ID卡时的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前PAD系统因隐私保护限制，通常仅针对少数ID卡训练，导致在未知国家ID卡上表现不佳。

Method: 使用零样本和微调两种测试协议，基于智利ID的私有数据集和芬兰、西班牙、斯洛伐克的公开数据集进行实验。

Result: 研究发现，真实图像（bona fide）是提升泛化能力的关键。

Conclusion: 基础模型能够显著提升PAD系统的泛化能力，尤其是在多国ID卡场景下。

Abstract: Nowadays, one of the main challenges in presentation attack detection (PAD)
on ID cards is obtaining generalisation capabilities for a diversity of
countries that are issuing ID cards. Most PAD systems are trained on one, two,
or three ID documents because of privacy protection concerns. As a result, they
do not obtain competitive results for commercial purposes when tested in an
unknown new ID card country. In this scenario, Foundation Models (FM) trained
on huge datasets can help to improve generalisation capabilities. This work
intends to improve and benchmark the capabilities of FM and how to use them to
adapt the generalisation on PAD of ID Documents. Different test protocols were
used, considering zero-shot and fine-tuning and two different ID card datasets.
One private dataset based on Chilean IDs and one open-set based on three ID
countries: Finland, Spain, and Slovakia. Our findings indicate that bona fide
images are the key to generalisation.

TL;DR: TF-CoVR是一个专注于时间细粒度视频检索的新基准，通过LLM生成查询-修改对，并提出了TF-CoVR-Base框架，显著提升了检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CoVR基准未能测试对快速时间差异的捕捉能力，因此需要专门针对时间细粒度的新基准。

Method: 提出TF-CoVR基准，包含180K三元组；设计TF-CoVR-Base框架，分两阶段训练视频编码器和对比学习对齐。

Result: TF-CoVR-Base在零样本和微调后分别将mAP@50从5.92提升至7.51和19.83提升至25.82。

Conclusion: TF-CoVR填补了时间细粒度检索的空白，TF-CoVR-Base框架显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Composed Video Retrieval (CoVR) retrieves a target video given a query video
and a modification text describing the intended change. Existing CoVR
benchmarks emphasize appearance shifts or coarse event changes and therefore do
not test the ability to capture subtle, fast-paced temporal differences. We
introduce TF-CoVR, the first large-scale benchmark dedicated to temporally
fine-grained CoVR. TF-CoVR focuses on gymnastics and diving and provides 180K
triplets drawn from FineGym and FineDiving. Previous CoVR benchmarks focusing
on temporal aspect, link each query to a single target segment taken from the
same video, limiting practical usefulness. In TF-CoVR, we instead construct
each <query, modification> pair by prompting an LLM with the label differences
between clips drawn from different videos; every pair is thus associated with
multiple valid target videos (3.9 on average), reflecting real-world tasks such
as sports-highlight generation. To model these temporal dynamics we propose
TF-CoVR-Base, a concise two-stage training framework: (i) pre-train a video
encoder on fine-grained action classification to obtain temporally
discriminative embeddings; (ii) align the composed query with candidate videos
using contrastive learning. We conduct the first comprehensive study of image,
video, and general multimodal embedding (GME) models on temporally fine-grained
composed retrieval in both zero-shot and fine-tuning regimes. On TF-CoVR,
TF-CoVR-Base improves zero-shot mAP@50 from 5.92 (LanguageBind) to 7.51, and
after fine-tuning raises the state-of-the-art from 19.83 to 25.82.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中难以保证完美的光度一致性，现有方法（如外观编码和双边网格）在建模能力和优化约束上存在局限。

Method: 提出多尺度双边网格，统一外观编码和双边网格，解决光度不一致问题。

Result: 在Waymo、NuScenes、Argoverse和PandaSet四个数据集上表现优异，几何精度显著提升，减少了浮游物。

Conclusion: 多尺度双边网格有效提升了自动驾驶场景重建的几何精度，对障碍物避障和控制至关重要。

Abstract: Neural rendering techniques, including NeRF and Gaussian Splatting (GS), rely
on photometric consistency to produce high-quality reconstructions. However, in
real-world scenarios, it is challenging to guarantee perfect photometric
consistency in acquired images. Appearance codes have been widely used to
address this issue, but their modeling capability is limited, as a single code
is applied to the entire image. Recently, the bilateral grid was introduced to
perform pixel-wise color mapping, but it is difficult to optimize and constrain
effectively. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-scale bilateral grid that
unifies appearance codes and bilateral grids. We demonstrate that this approach
significantly improves geometric accuracy in dynamic, decoupled autonomous
driving scene reconstruction, outperforming both appearance codes and bilateral
grids. This is crucial for autonomous driving, where accurate geometry is
important for obstacle avoidance and control. Our method shows strong results
across four datasets: Waymo, NuScenes, Argoverse, and PandaSet. We further
demonstrate that the improvement in geometry is driven by the multi-scale
bilateral grid, which effectively reduces floaters caused by photometric
inconsistency.

Motivation: 解决传统方法需要手动处理对称性和无法统一处理点云配准与形状组装的问题。

Method: 通过学习点速度场将噪声点移动到目标位置，并结合自监督编码器专注于重叠点。

Result: 在六个基准测试中达到最新性能，统一框架支持跨数据集联合训练，提升几何先验学习。

Conclusion: Rectified Point Flow 提供了一种高效、统一的解决方案，显著提升了点云配准和形状组装的性能。

Abstract: We introduce Rectified Point Flow, a unified parameterization that formulates
pairwise point cloud registration and multi-part shape assembly as a single
conditional generative problem. Given unposed point clouds, our method learns a
continuous point-wise velocity field that transports noisy points toward their
target positions, from which part poses are recovered. In contrast to prior
work that regresses part-wise poses with ad-hoc symmetry handling, our method
intrinsically learns assembly symmetries without symmetry labels. Together with
a self-supervised encoder focused on overlapping points, our method achieves a
new state-of-the-art performance on six benchmarks spanning pairwise
registration and shape assembly. Notably, our unified formulation enables
effective joint training on diverse datasets, facilitating the learning of
shared geometric priors and consequently boosting accuracy. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频世界模型因时间上下文窗口有限，在场景重现时难以保持一致性，导致环境遗忘。受人类记忆机制启发，作者希望通过空间记忆解决这一问题。

Method: 引入了一种基于几何的长时空间记忆框架，包括存储和检索信息的机制，并使用定制数据集训练和评估带有3D记忆机制的模型。

Result: 评估显示，相比基线模型，该方法在生成质量、一致性和上下文长度方面均有提升。

Conclusion: 该框架为长时一致的世界生成提供了新方向。

Abstract: Emerging world models autoregressively generate video frames in response to
actions, such as camera movements and text prompts, among other control
signals. Due to limited temporal context window sizes, these models often
struggle to maintain scene consistency during revisits, leading to severe
forgetting of previously generated environments. Inspired by the mechanisms of
human memory, we introduce a novel framework to enhancing long-term consistency
of video world models through a geometry-grounded long-term spatial memory. Our
framework includes mechanisms to store and retrieve information from the
long-term spatial memory and we curate custom datasets to train and evaluate
world models with explicitly stored 3D memory mechanisms. Our evaluations show
improved quality, consistency, and context length compared to relevant
baselines, paving the way towards long-term consistent world generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D形状补全方法缺乏3D一致性、计算成本高且难以捕捉尖锐边界，RaySt3R旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 使用单张RGB-D图像和查询射线，训练前馈Transformer预测深度图、物体掩码和置信度，并通过多视角融合完成3D重建。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上表现优异，3D chamfer距离比基线方法提升高达44%。

Conclusion: RaySt3R通过新视角合成方法显著提升了3D形状补全的性能和效率。

Abstract: 3D shape completion has broad applications in robotics, digital twin
reconstruction, and extended reality (XR). Although recent advances in 3D
object and scene completion have achieved impressive results, existing methods
lack 3D consistency, are computationally expensive, and struggle to capture
sharp object boundaries. Our work (RaySt3R) addresses these limitations by
recasting 3D shape completion as a novel view synthesis problem. Specifically,
given a single RGB-D image and a novel viewpoint (encoded as a collection of
query rays), we train a feedforward transformer to predict depth maps, object
masks, and per-pixel confidence scores for those query rays. RaySt3R fuses
these predictions across multiple query views to reconstruct complete 3D
shapes. We evaluate RaySt3R on synthetic and real-world datasets, and observe
it achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the baselines on all
datasets by up to 44% in 3D chamfer distance. Project page:

TL;DR: 论文提出Vision Concept Transformer (VCT)和Stable Vision Concept Transformer (SVCT)，解决现有概念瓶颈模型(CBMs)在医学领域中的效用和稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学领域对透明性的需求促使研究可解释AI (XAI)，但现有CBMs仅依赖概念特征，忽略了医学图像的内在特征，且对输入扰动不稳定。

Method: VCT结合概念特征与图像特征；SVCT基于VCT，采用视觉变换器(ViT)和Denoised Diffusion Smoothing提升稳定性和解释性。

Result: 在四个医学数据集上，VCT和SVCT保持准确性且可解释，SVCT在扰动下仍提供稳定解释。

Conclusion: VCT和SVCT满足医学领域对准确性和解释性的双重需求，SVCT尤其适用于扰动环境。

Abstract: Transparency is a paramount concern in the medical field, prompting
researchers to delve into the realm of explainable AI (XAI). Among these XAI
methods, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) aim to restrict the model's latent
space to human-understandable high-level concepts by generating a conceptual
layer for extracting conceptual features, which has drawn much attention
recently. However, existing methods rely solely on concept features to
determine the model's predictions, which overlook the intrinsic feature
embeddings within medical images. To address this utility gap between the
original models and concept-based models, we propose Vision Concept Transformer
(VCT). Furthermore, despite their benefits, CBMs have been found to negatively
impact model performance and fail to provide stable explanations when faced
with input perturbations, which limits their application in the medical field.
To address this faithfulness issue, this paper further proposes the Stable
Vision Concept Transformer (SVCT) based on VCT, which leverages the vision
transformer (ViT) as its backbone and incorporates a conceptual layer. SVCT
employs conceptual features to enhance decision-making capabilities by fusing
them with image features and ensures model faithfulness through the integration
of Denoised Diffusion Smoothing. Comprehensive experiments on four medical
datasets demonstrate that our VCT and SVCT maintain accuracy while remaining
interpretable compared to baselines. Furthermore, even when subjected to
perturbations, our SVCT model consistently provides faithful explanations, thus
meeting the needs of the medical field.

<details>

Motivation: 现有基准主要关注静态场景，缺乏对动态交互中对象变化的评估，因此需要开发新基准以提升多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的物体认知能力。

Method: 提出EOC-Bench，包含3,277个标注QA对，分为过去、现在和未来三类，涵盖11个评估维度和3种视觉对象引用类型，并设计了混合格式标注框架和多尺度时间准确性指标。

Result: 基于EOC-Bench对多种MLLMs进行全面评估，验证了其在提升MLLMs物体认知能力方面的有效性。

Conclusion: EOC-Bench为提升MLLMs的物体认知能力提供了重要工具，为开发可靠的嵌入式系统核心模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: The emergence of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has driven
breakthroughs in egocentric vision applications. These applications necessitate
persistent, context-aware understanding of objects, as users interact with
tools in dynamic and cluttered environments. However, existing embodied
benchmarks primarily focus on static scene exploration, emphasizing object's
appearance and spatial attributes while neglecting the assessment of dynamic
changes arising from users' interactions. To address this gap, we introduce
EOC-Bench, an innovative benchmark designed to systematically evaluate
object-centric embodied cognition in dynamic egocentric scenarios. Specially,
EOC-Bench features 3,277 meticulously annotated QA pairs categorized into three
temporal categories: Past, Present, and Future, covering 11 fine-grained
evaluation dimensions and 3 visual object referencing types. To ensure thorough
assessment, we develop a mixed-format human-in-the-loop annotation framework
with four types of questions and design a novel multi-scale temporal accuracy
metric for open-ended temporal evaluation. Based on EOC-Bench, we conduct
comprehensive evaluations of various proprietary, open-source, and object-level
MLLMs. EOC-Bench serves as a crucial tool for advancing the embodied object
cognitive capabilities of MLLMs, establishing a robust foundation for
developing reliable core models for embodied systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像分词器在压缩过程中编码的双向依赖关系阻碍了自回归模型的有效建模，因此需要一种新的分词器来对齐自回归模型的建模方式。

Method: 提出AliTok，利用因果解码器建立单向依赖关系，并通过前缀标记和两阶段分词器训练增强重建一致性。

Result: 在ImageNet-256基准测试中，AliTok在177M参数下达到gFID 1.50和IS 305.9；在662M参数下，gFID 1.35，超越现有扩散方法且采样速度快10倍。

Conclusion: AliTok在生成友好性和重建性能上表现出色，为自回归图像生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Autoregressive image generation aims to predict the next token based on
previous ones. However, existing image tokenizers encode tokens with
bidirectional dependencies during the compression process, which hinders the
effective modeling by autoregressive models. In this paper, we propose a novel
Aligned Tokenizer (AliTok), which utilizes a causal decoder to establish
unidirectional dependencies among encoded tokens, thereby aligning the token
modeling approach between the tokenizer and autoregressive model. Furthermore,
by incorporating prefix tokens and employing two-stage tokenizer training to
enhance reconstruction consistency, AliTok achieves great reconstruction
performance while being generation-friendly. On ImageNet-256 benchmark, using a
standard decoder-only autoregressive model as the generator with only 177M
parameters, AliTok achieves a gFID score of 1.50 and an IS of 305.9. When the
parameter count is increased to 662M, AliTok achieves a gFID score of 1.35,
surpassing the state-of-the-art diffusion method with 10x faster sampling
speed. The code and weights are available at

Motivation: 尽管现有扩散视频修复方法在视觉质量上有显著提升，但其推理计算成本过高，且针对高分辨率视频的实时修复仍具挑战性。

Method: 提出SeedVR2模型，采用对抗训练和动态调整窗口大小的注意力机制，结合多种损失函数（如特征匹配损失）优化训练稳定性。

Result: 实验表明，SeedVR2在单步推理中性能优于或与现有方法相当。

Conclusion: SeedVR2为高分辨率视频修复提供了一种高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based video restoration (VR) demonstrate
significant improvement in visual quality, yet yield a prohibitive
computational cost during inference. While several distillation-based
approaches have exhibited the potential of one-step image restoration,
extending existing approaches to VR remains challenging and underexplored,
particularly when dealing with high-resolution video in real-world settings. In
this work, we propose a one-step diffusion-based VR model, termed as SeedVR2,
which performs adversarial VR training against real data. To handle the
challenging high-resolution VR within a single step, we introduce several
enhancements to both model architecture and training procedures. Specifically,
an adaptive window attention mechanism is proposed, where the window size is
dynamically adjusted to fit the output resolutions, avoiding window
inconsistency observed under high-resolution VR using window attention with a
predefined window size. To stabilize and improve the adversarial post-training
towards VR, we further verify the effectiveness of a series of losses,
including a proposed feature matching loss without significantly sacrificing
training efficiency. Extensive experiments show that SeedVR2 can achieve
comparable or even better performance compared with existing VR approaches in a
single step.

Result: PAM在多种任务中表现优异，运行速度快1.2-2.4倍，GPU内存消耗更低。

Conclusion: PAM为区域级视觉理解提供了高效基准，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: We present Perceive Anything Model (PAM), a conceptually straightforward and
efficient framework for comprehensive region-level visual understanding in
images and videos. Our approach extends the powerful segmentation model SAM 2
by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling simultaneous object
segmentation with the generation of diverse, region-specific semantic outputs,
including categories, label definition, functional explanations, and detailed
captions. A key component, Semantic Perceiver, is introduced to efficiently
transform SAM 2's rich visual features, which inherently carry general vision,
localization, and semantic priors into multi-modal tokens for LLM
comprehension. To support robust multi-granularity understanding, we also
develop a dedicated data refinement and augmentation pipeline, yielding a
high-quality dataset of 1.5M image and 0.6M video region-semantic annotations,
including novel region-level streaming video caption data. PAM is designed for
lightweightness and efficiency, while also demonstrates strong performance
across a diverse range of region understanding tasks. It runs 1.2-2.4x faster
and consumes less GPU memory than prior approaches, offering a practical
solution for real-world applications. We believe that our effective approach
will serve as a strong baseline for future research in region-level visual
understanding.

Result: 在SPair-71k上实现了4%的绝对增益，且比类似监督需求的方法高出7%。

Conclusion: 该方法减少了特定数据集标注需求，并展示了扩展到其他数据源的潜力。

Abstract: Finding correspondences between semantically similar points across images and
object instances is one of the everlasting challenges in computer vision. While
large pre-trained vision models have recently been demonstrated as effective
priors for semantic matching, they still suffer from ambiguities for symmetric
objects or repeated object parts. We propose to improve semantic correspondence
estimation via 3D-aware pseudo-labeling. Specifically, we train an adapter to
refine off-the-shelf features using pseudo-labels obtained via 3D-aware
chaining, filtering wrong labels through relaxed cyclic consistency, and 3D
spherical prototype mapping constraints. While reducing the need for dataset
specific annotations compared to prior work, we set a new state-of-the-art on
SPair-71k by over 4% absolute gain and by over 7% against methods with similar
supervision requirements. The generality of our proposed approach simplifies
extension of training to other data sources, which we demonstrate in our
experiments.

Abstract: Editing materials of objects in images based on exemplar images is an active
area of research in computer vision and graphics. We propose MARBLE, a method
for performing material blending and recomposing fine-grained material
properties by finding material embeddings in CLIP-space and using that to
control pre-trained text-to-image models. We improve exemplar-based material
editing by finding a block in the denoising UNet responsible for material
attribution. Given two material exemplar-images, we find directions in the
CLIP-space for blending the materials. Further, we can achieve parametric
control over fine-grained material attributes such as roughness, metallic,
transparency, and glow using a shallow network to predict the direction for the
desired material attribute change. We perform qualitative and quantitative
analysis to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method. We also present
the ability of our method to perform multiple edits in a single forward pass
and applicability to painting.

Conclusion: ProJo4D在物理基础的4D场景理解中表现出色，为稀疏输入下的物理参数估计提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Neural rendering has made significant strides in 3D reconstruction and novel
view synthesis. With the integration with physics, it opens up new
applications. The inverse problem of estimating physics from visual data,
however, still remains challenging, limiting its effectiveness for applications
like physically accurate digital twin creation in robotics and XR. Existing
methods that incorporate physics into neural rendering frameworks typically
require dense multi-view videos as input, making them impractical for scalable,
real-world use. When presented with sparse multi-view videos, the sequential
optimization strategy used by existing approaches introduces significant error
accumulation, e.g., poor initial 3D reconstruction leads to bad material
parameter estimation in subsequent stages. Instead of sequential optimization,
directly optimizing all parameters at the same time also fails due to the
highly non-convex and often non-differentiable nature of the problem. We
propose ProJo4D, a progressive joint optimization framework that gradually
increases the set of jointly optimized parameters guided by their sensitivity,
leading to fully joint optimization over geometry, appearance, physical state,
and material property. Evaluations on PAC-NeRF and Spring-Gaus datasets show
that ProJo4D outperforms prior work in 4D future state prediction, novel view
rendering of future state, and material parameter estimation, demonstrating its
effectiveness in physically grounded 4D scene understanding. For demos, please

TL;DR: 论文探讨了3D视觉语言模型（VLMs）的性能问题，发现3D场景中心模型表现较差，并提出新数据集以改进3D理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究3D VLMs的性能差距，尤其是3D场景中心模型表现不佳的原因，并提出改进方案。

Method: 分类3D VLMs为3D对象中心、2D图像基础和3D场景中心方法，分析其性能差异并提出新数据集。

Result: 发现3D场景中心模型对3D编码器依赖有限，预训练效果较差，且数据扩展收益不明显。

Conclusion: 需改进评估策略和数据集设计，以提升3D VLMs的3D场景理解能力。

Abstract: Remarkable progress in 2D Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has spurred interest
in extending them to 3D settings for tasks like 3D Question Answering, Dense
Captioning, and Visual Grounding. Unlike 2D VLMs that typically process images
through an image encoder, 3D scenes, with their intricate spatial structures,
allow for diverse model architectures. Based on their encoder design, this
paper categorizes recent 3D VLMs into 3D object-centric, 2D image-based, and 3D
scene-centric approaches. Despite the architectural similarity of 3D
scene-centric VLMs to their 2D counterparts, they have exhibited comparatively
lower performance compared with the latest 3D object-centric and 2D image-based
approaches. To understand this gap, we conduct an in-depth analysis, revealing
that 3D scene-centric VLMs show limited reliance on the 3D scene encoder, and
the pre-train stage appears less effective than in 2D VLMs. Furthermore, we
observe that data scaling benefits are less pronounced on larger datasets. Our
investigation suggests that while these models possess cross-modal alignment
capabilities, they tend to over-rely on linguistic cues and overfit to frequent
answer distributions, thereby diminishing the effective utilization of the 3D
encoder. To address these limitations and encourage genuine 3D scene
understanding, we introduce a novel 3D Relevance Discrimination QA dataset
designed to disrupt shortcut learning and improve 3D understanding. Our
findings highlight the need for advanced evaluation and improved strategies for
better 3D understanding in 3D VLMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于点图的PM-Loss正则化损失，用于改进深度图在3D高斯泼溅中的几何平滑性，从而提升渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度图在3D高斯泼溅中因物体边界的不连续性导致点云稀疏或碎片化，影响渲染质量。

Method: 引入PM-Loss，利用预训练变换器预测的点图来正则化深度图，增强几何平滑性。

Result: 改进后的深度图显著提升了3D高斯泼溅的渲染效果，适用于多种架构和场景。

Conclusion: PM-Loss有效解决了深度图在3D高斯泼溅中的几何平滑性问题，提升了渲染质量。

Abstract: Depth maps are widely used in feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
pipelines by unprojecting them into 3D point clouds for novel view synthesis.
This approach offers advantages such as efficient training, the use of known
camera poses, and accurate geometry estimation. However, depth discontinuities
at object boundaries often lead to fragmented or sparse point clouds, degrading
rendering quality -- a well-known limitation of depth-based representations. To
tackle this issue, we introduce PM-Loss, a novel regularization loss based on a
pointmap predicted by a pre-trained transformer. Although the pointmap itself
may be less accurate than the depth map, it effectively enforces geometric
smoothness, especially around object boundaries. With the improved depth map,
our method significantly improves the feed-forward 3DGS across various
architectures and scenes, delivering consistently better rendering results. Our

Motivation: 现有视频理解模型在计数任务上表现不佳，且现有基准存在视频短、查询封闭、缺乏线索标注和多模态覆盖不足等问题。

Method: 提出CG-AV-Counting基准，并开发AV-Reasoner模型，结合GRPO和课程学习提升计数能力。

Result: AV-Reasoner在多个基准上达到SOTA，但在域外基准上表现不佳。

Conclusion: CG-AV-Counting为计数任务提供了全面测试基准，AV-Reasoner展示了强化学习的有效性，但在域外泛化能力有限。

Abstract: Despite progress in video understanding, current MLLMs struggle with counting
tasks. Existing benchmarks are limited by short videos, close-set queries, lack
of clue annotations, and weak multimodal coverage. In this paper, we introduce
CG-AV-Counting, a manually-annotated clue-grounded counting benchmark with
1,027 multimodal questions and 5,845 annotated clues over 497 long videos. It
supports both black-box and white-box evaluation, serving as a comprehensive
testbed for both end-to-end and reasoning-based counting. To explore ways to
improve model's counting capability, we propose AV-Reasoner, a model trained
with GRPO and curriculum learning to generalize counting ability from related
tasks. AV-Reasoner achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple
benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of reinforcement learning. However,
experiments show that on out-of-domain benchmarks, reasoning in the language
space fails to bring performance gains. The code and benchmark have been

TL;DR: MINT-CoT通过动态插入视觉标记到文本推理步骤中，解决了多模态数学推理中的视觉感知和区域选择问题，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多模态数学推理中存在视觉区域选择粗糙、视觉编码器感知有限和依赖外部视觉修改能力的局限性。

Method: 提出MINT-CoT方法，通过Interleave Token动态选择任意形状的视觉区域，并构建了包含54K数学问题的数据集和三阶段训练策略。

Result: MINT-CoT-7B在MathVista、GeoQA和MMStar上分别比基线模型提升了34.08%、28.78%和23.2%。

Conclusion: MINT-CoT在多模态数学推理中表现出色，为视觉与文本结合的推理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has widely enhanced mathematical reasoning in Large
Language Models (LLMs), but it still remains challenging for extending it to
multimodal domains. Existing works either adopt a similar textual reasoning for
image input, or seek to interleave visual signals into mathematical CoT.
However, they face three key limitations for math problem-solving: reliance on
coarse-grained box-shaped image regions, limited perception of vision encoders
on math content, and dependence on external capabilities for visual
modification. In this paper, we propose MINT-CoT, introducing Mathematical
INterleaved Tokens for Chain-of-Thought visual reasoning. MINT-CoT adaptively
interleaves relevant visual tokens into textual reasoning steps via an
Interleave Token, which dynamically selects visual regions of any shapes within
math figures. To empower this capability, we construct the MINT-CoT dataset,
containing 54K mathematical problems aligning each reasoning step with visual
regions at the token level, accompanied by a rigorous data generation pipeline.
We further present a three-stage MINT-CoT training strategy, progressively
combining text-only CoT SFT, interleaved CoT SFT, and interleaved CoT RL, which
derives our MINT-CoT-7B model. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method for effective visual interleaved reasoning in
mathematical domains, where MINT-CoT-7B outperforms the baseline model by
+34.08% on MathVista, +28.78% on GeoQA, and +23.2% on MMStar, respectively. Our
code and data are available at https://github.com/xinyan-cxy/MINT-CoT

TL;DR: 论文提出了VideoMarathon数据集和Hour-LLaVA模型，填补了长视频多模态模型训练的空白，并在多个长视频语言基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长视频多模态模型训练因缺乏高质量的长视频标注数据而受限，论文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 构建了包含9,700小时长视频的VideoMarathon数据集，并提出Hour-LLaVA模型，通过内存增强模块实现高效训练和推理。

Result: Hour-LLaVA在多个长视频语言基准测试中表现最佳，验证了数据集和模型的有效性。

Conclusion: VideoMarathon数据集和Hour-LLaVA模型为长视频多模态理解提供了重要资源和技术支持。

Abstract: Recent long-form video-language understanding benchmarks have driven progress
in video large multimodal models (Video-LMMs). However, the scarcity of
well-annotated long videos has left the training of hour-long Video-LLMs
underexplored. To close this gap, we present VideoMarathon, a large-scale
hour-long video instruction-following dataset. This dataset includes around
9,700 hours of long videos sourced from diverse domains, ranging from 3 to 60
minutes per video. Specifically, it contains 3.3M high-quality QA pairs,
spanning six fundamental topics: temporality, spatiality, object, action,
scene, and event. Compared to existing video instruction datasets,
VideoMarathon significantly extends training video durations up to 1 hour, and
supports 22 diverse tasks requiring both short- and long-term video
comprehension. Building on VideoMarathon, we propose Hour-LLaVA, a powerful and
efficient Video-LMM for hour-scale video-language modeling. It enables
hour-long video training and inference at 1-FPS sampling by leveraging a memory
augmentation module, which adaptively integrates user question-relevant and
spatiotemporal-informative semantics from a cached full video context. In our
experiments, Hour-LLaVA achieves the best performance on multiple long
video-language benchmarks, demonstrating the high quality of the VideoMarathon
dataset and the superiority of the Hour-LLaVA model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于视频的时空定位方法缺乏大型语言模型的推理能力，限制了上下文理解和泛化能力。VideoMolmo旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 基于Molmo架构，引入时间模块和双向点传播的掩码融合管道，结合LLM生成坐标和序列掩码融合模块。

Result: 在多个真实场景和基准测试中，VideoMolmo显著提升了时空定位准确性和推理能力。

Conclusion: VideoMolmo通过结合语言模型和时间一致性模块，为时空定位任务提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal localization is vital for precise interactions across diverse
domains, from biological research to autonomous navigation and interactive
interfaces. Current video-based approaches, while proficient in tracking, lack
the sophisticated reasoning capabilities of large language models, limiting
their contextual understanding and generalization. We introduce VideoMolmo, a
large multimodal model tailored for fine-grained spatio-temporal pointing
conditioned on textual descriptions. Building upon the Molmo architecture,
VideoMolmo incorporates a temporal module utilizing an attention mechanism to
condition each frame on preceding frames, ensuring temporal consistency.
Additionally, our novel temporal mask fusion pipeline employs SAM2 for
bidirectional point propagation, significantly enhancing coherence across video
sequences. This two-step decomposition, i.e., first using the LLM to generate
precise pointing coordinates, then relying on a sequential mask-fusion module
to produce coherent segmentation, not only simplifies the task for the language
model but also enhances interpretability. Due to the lack of suitable datasets,
we curate a comprehensive dataset comprising 72k video-caption pairs annotated
with 100k object points. To evaluate the generalization of VideoMolmo, we
introduce VPoS-Bench, a challenging out-of-distribution benchmark spanning five
real-world scenarios: Cell Tracking, Egocentric Vision, Autonomous Driving,
Video-GUI Interaction, and Robotics. We also evaluate our model on Referring
Video Object Segmentation (Refer-VOS) and Reasoning VOS tasks. In comparison to
existing models, VideoMolmo substantially improves spatio-temporal pointing
accuracy and reasoning capability. Our code and models are publicly available
at https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/VideoMolmo.

TL;DR: 提出了一种从室内空间的纹理网格和多视角全景图像生成无家具复制品的流程，通过简化网格和ControlNet修复技术实现高质量结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如神经辐射场或RGB-D修复）在生成无家具场景时存在模糊或幻觉问题，需要一种更可靠的方法。

Method: 1. 分割并移除家具，生成简化网格（SDM）；2. 从SDM提取边缘信息；3. 使用ControlNet修复全景图像；4. 用修复图像重新纹理化网格。

Result: 生成的无家具场景资产质量高于神经辐射场和RGB-D修复方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合几何指导和图像修复，显著提升了无家具场景生成的质量和可靠性。

Abstract: We present a pipeline for generating defurnished replicas of indoor spaces
represented as textured meshes and corresponding multi-view panoramic images.
To achieve this, we first segment and remove furniture from the mesh
representation, extend planes, and fill holes, obtaining a simplified
defurnished mesh (SDM). This SDM acts as an ``X-ray'' of the scene's underlying
structure, guiding the defurnishing process. We extract Canny edges from depth
and normal images rendered from the SDM. We then use these as a guide to remove
the furniture from panorama images via ControlNet inpainting. This control
signal ensures the availability of global geometric information that may be
hidden from a particular panoramic view by the furniture being removed. The
inpainted panoramas are used to texture the mesh. We show that our approach
produces higher quality assets than methods that rely on neural radiance
fields, which tend to produce blurry low-resolution images, or RGB-D
inpainting, which is highly susceptible to hallucinations.

TL;DR: DirectLayout是一个通过大语言模型直接生成3D室内场景布局的框架，解决了现有方法在开放词汇和细粒度用户指令对齐上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D室内场景合成的布局生成因数据集有限而具有挑战性，现有方法要么过拟合，要么依赖预定义约束，牺牲了灵活性。

Method: DirectLayout分三阶段生成布局：鸟瞰图生成、3D空间提升和对象放置优化，结合Chain-of-Thought激活和奖励机制增强空间推理。

Result: 实验表明，DirectLayout在语义一致性、泛化能力和物理合理性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: DirectLayout通过直接生成数值布局，实现了开放词汇和细粒度指令对齐的3D场景合成。

Abstract: Realistic 3D indoor scene synthesis is vital for embodied AI and digital
content creation. It can be naturally divided into two subtasks: object
generation and layout generation. While recent generative models have
significantly advanced object-level quality and controllability, layout
generation remains challenging due to limited datasets. Existing methods either
overfit to these datasets or rely on predefined constraints to optimize
numerical layout that sacrifice flexibility. As a result, they fail to generate
scenes that are both open-vocabulary and aligned with fine-grained user
instructions. We introduce DirectLayout, a framework that directly generates
numerical 3D layouts from text descriptions using generalizable spatial
reasoning of large language models (LLMs). DirectLayout decomposes the
generation into three stages: producing a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) layout, lifting
it into 3D space, and refining object placements. To enable explicit spatial
reasoning and help the model grasp basic principles of object placement, we
employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Activation based on the 3D-Front dataset.
Additionally, we design CoT-Grounded Generative Layout Reward to enhance
generalization and spatial planning. During inference, DirectLayout addresses
asset-layout mismatches via Iterative Asset-Layout Alignment through in-context
learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DirectLayout achieves
impressive semantic consistency, generalization and physical plausibility.

Result: RAS在ORES任务及经典RES和GRES任务中表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: ORES任务和RAS框架为多模态交互提供了新的解决方案，并在实验中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Recent image segmentation models have advanced to segment images into
high-quality masks for visual entities, and yet they cannot provide
comprehensive semantic understanding for complex queries based on both language
and vision. This limitation reduces their effectiveness in applications that
require user-friendly interactions driven by vision-language prompts. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a novel task of omnimodal referring expression
segmentation (ORES). In this task, a model produces a group of masks based on
arbitrary prompts specified by text only or text plus reference visual
entities. To address this new challenge, we propose a novel framework to "Refer
to Any Segmentation Mask Group" (RAS), which augments segmentation models with
complex multimodal interactions and comprehension via a mask-centric large
multimodal model. For training and benchmarking ORES models, we create datasets
MaskGroups-2M and MaskGroups-HQ to include diverse mask groups specified by
text and reference entities. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate
superior performance of RAS on our new ORES task, as well as classic referring
expression segmentation (RES) and generalized referring expression segmentation
(GRES) tasks. Project page: https://Ref2Any.github.io.

Motivation: 探索MLLMs如何处理视觉输入，发现注意力头的稀疏性，旨在优化其推理效率。

Method: 通过分析注意力机制识别视觉头，设计训练无关的框架量化其视觉相关性，并开发SparseMM优化策略。

Result: SparseMM在主流多模态基准测试中实现了1.38倍实时加速和52%内存减少，同时保持性能。

Conclusion: 视觉头的稀疏性为MLLMs优化提供了新思路，SparseMM在效率和准确性间取得了优异平衡。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are commonly derived by extending
pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) with visual capabilities. In this
work, we investigate how MLLMs process visual inputs by analyzing their
attention mechanisms. We reveal a surprising sparsity phenomenon: only a small
subset (approximately less than 5%) of attention heads in LLMs actively
contribute to visual understanding, termed visual heads. To identify these
heads efficiently, we design a training-free framework that quantifies
head-level visual relevance through targeted response analysis. Building on
this discovery, we introduce SparseMM, a KV-Cache optimization strategy that
allocates asymmetric computation budgets to heads in LLMs based on their visual
scores, leveraging the sparity of visual heads for accelerating the inference
of MLLMs. Compared with prior KV-Cache acceleration methods that ignore the
particularity of visual, SparseMM prioritizes stress and retaining visual
semantics during decoding. Extensive evaluations across mainstream multimodal
benchmarks demonstrate that SparseMM achieves superior accuracy-efficiency
trade-offs. Notably, SparseMM delivers 1.38x real-time acceleration and 52%
memory reduction during generation while maintaining performance parity on
efficiency test. Our project is open sourced at

Abstract: We present the first system for physically based, neural inverse rendering

time-resolved extension of neural radiance caching -- a technique that
accelerates inverse rendering by storing infinite-bounce radiance arriving at

direct and indirect light transport effects and, when applied to captured
measurements from a flash lidar system, enables state-of-the-art 3D
reconstruction in the presence of strong indirect light. Further, we
demonstrate view synthesis of propagating light, automatic decomposition of
captured measurements into direct and indirect components, as well as novel

Conclusion: FreeTimeGS通过灵活的高斯基元表示和运动函数，有效提升了动态3D场景的建模能力。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes with
complex motions. Some recent works define 3D Gaussian primitives in the
canonical space and use deformation fields to map canonical primitives to
observation spaces, achieving real-time dynamic view synthesis. However, these
methods often struggle to handle scenes with complex motions due to the
difficulty of optimizing deformation fields. To overcome this problem, we
propose FreeTimeGS, a novel 4D representation that allows Gaussian primitives
to appear at arbitrary time and locations. In contrast to canonical Gaussian
primitives, our representation possesses the strong flexibility, thus improving
the ability to model dynamic 3D scenes. In addition, we endow each Gaussian
primitive with an motion function, allowing it to move to neighboring regions
over time, which reduces the temporal redundancy. Experiments results on
several datasets show that the rendering quality of our method outperforms
recent methods by a large margin.

TL;DR: VideoMathQA是一个用于评估模型在视频中进行跨模态数学推理能力的基准测试，覆盖10个数学领域，包含从10秒到1小时以上的视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的视频数学推理与静态图像或文本不同，需要整合多模态信息，而现有方法在此类任务上表现不足。

Method: 通过专家标注的高质量数据集，设计三类核心推理挑战：直接问题解决、概念迁移和深度教学理解。

Result: 基准测试揭示了现有方法的局限性，并提供了细粒度诊断模型能力的工具。

Conclusion: VideoMathQA为跨模态数学推理任务提供了系统化的评估框架。

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning in real-world video settings presents a fundamentally
different challenge than in static images or text. It requires interpreting
fine-grained visual information, accurately reading handwritten or digital
text, and integrating spoken cues, often dispersed non-linearly over time. In
such multimodal contexts, success hinges not just on perception, but on
selectively identifying and integrating the right contextual details from a
rich and noisy stream of content. To this end, we introduce VideoMathQA, a
benchmark designed to evaluate whether models can perform such temporally
extended cross-modal reasoning on videos. The benchmark spans 10 diverse
mathematical domains, covering videos ranging from 10 seconds to over 1 hour.
It requires models to interpret structured visual content, understand
instructional narratives, and jointly ground concepts across visual, audio, and
textual modalities. We employ graduate-level experts to ensure high quality,
totaling over $920$ man-hours of annotation. To reflect real-world scenarios,
questions are designed around three core reasoning challenges: direct problem
solving, where answers are grounded in the presented question; conceptual
transfer, which requires applying learned methods to new problems; and deep
instructional comprehension, involving multi-step reasoning over extended
explanations and partially worked-out solutions. Each question includes
multi-step reasoning annotations, enabling fine-grained diagnosis of model
capabilities. Through this benchmark, we highlight the limitations of existing
approaches and establish a systematic evaluation framework for models that must
reason, rather than merely perceive, across temporally extended and
modality-rich mathematical problem settings. Our benchmark and evaluation code
are available at: https://mbzuai-oryx.github.io/VideoMathQA

between sample pairs are unique. However, in conditional settings (e.g.,
class-conditioned models), this uniqueness is no longer guaranteed--flows from
different conditions may overlap, leading to more ambiguous generations. We
introduce Contrastive Flow Matching, an extension to the flow matching
objective that explicitly enforces uniqueness across all conditional flows,
enhancing condition separation. Our approach adds a contrastive objective that
maximizes dissimilarities between predicted flows from arbitrary sample pairs.
We validate Contrastive Flow Matching by conducting extensive experiments
across varying model architectures on both class-conditioned (ImageNet-1k) and
text-to-image (CC3M) benchmarks. Notably, we find that training models with
Contrastive Flow Matching (1) improves training speed by a factor of up to 9x,
(2) requires up to 5x fewer de-noising steps and (3) lowers FID by up to 8.9
compared to training the same models with flow matching. We release our code

<details>

Method: 通过梯度反转攻击，利用可访问的适配器梯度重构目标用户的本地数据样本。

Result: 实验表明，攻击者可以高保真地恢复大量微调图像。

Conclusion: 研究强调了PEFT机制需要隐私保护措施，并提出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows multiple data-owners to collaboratively train
machine learning models by exchanging local gradients, while keeping their
private data on-device. To simultaneously enhance privacy and training
efficiency, recently parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of large-scale
pretrained models has gained substantial attention in FL. While keeping a
pretrained (backbone) model frozen, each user fine-tunes only a few lightweight
modules to be used in conjunction, to fit specific downstream applications.
Accordingly, only the gradients with respect to these lightweight modules are
shared with the server. In this work, we investigate how the privacy of the
fine-tuning data of the users can be compromised via a malicious design of the
pretrained model and trainable adapter modules. We demonstrate gradient
inversion attacks on a popular PEFT mechanism, the adapter, which allow an
attacker to reconstruct local data samples of a target user, using only the
accessible adapter gradients. Via extensive experiments, we demonstrate that a
large batch of fine-tuning images can be retrieved with high fidelity. Our
attack highlights the need for privacy-preserving mechanisms for PEFT, while
opening up several future directions. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 提出一种轻量级深度学习方法，结合Retinex分解与泊松去噪，用于极端低光条件下的图像去噪与增强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统高斯噪声假设不适用于低光成像中信号依赖性泊松噪声的问题。

Method: 设计统一的编码器-解码器网络，集成Retinex分解与泊松去噪损失，无需先验反射与光照信息。

Result: 显著提升低光条件下的可见性与亮度，同时保持图像结构与色彩一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法在极端低光条件下有效且实用，解决了信号依赖性噪声问题。

Abstract: Low-light image denoising and enhancement are challenging, especially when
traditional noise assumptions, such as Gaussian noise, do not hold in majority.
In many real-world scenarios, such as low-light imaging, noise is
signal-dependent and is better represented as Poisson noise. In this work, we
address the problem of denoising images degraded by Poisson noise under extreme
low-light conditions. We introduce a light-weight deep learning-based method
that integrates Retinex based decomposition with Poisson denoising into a
unified encoder-decoder network. The model simultaneously enhances illumination
and suppresses noise by incorporating a Poisson denoising loss to address
signal-dependent noise. Without prior requirement for reflectance and
illumination, the network learns an effective decomposition process while
ensuring consistent reflectance and smooth illumination without causing any
form of color distortion. The experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness and practicality of the proposed low-light illumination
enhancement method. Our method significantly improves visibility and brightness
in low-light conditions, while preserving image structure and color constancy
under ambient illumination.

TL;DR: DACN是一种用于高光谱图像超分辨率的双注意力卷积网络，通过多头注意力和通道注意力机制解决局部依赖性和数据稀缺问题，结合优化损失函数提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 2D卷积神经网络在高光谱图像超分辨率任务中因局部依赖性和数据稀缺性表现受限，需引入全局上下文理解。

Method: 采用增强卷积和多头注意力捕捉局部与全局特征依赖，通过通道和空间注意力图优化关注点，结合L2正则化和空间-光谱梯度损失函数。

Result: 在两个高光谱数据集上，多头注意力与通道注意力的组合表现优于单独使用任一种注意力机制。

Conclusion: DACN通过双注意力机制和优化损失函数，显著提升了高光谱图像超分辨率的性能。

Abstract: 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have attracted significant attention
for hyperspectral image super-resolution tasks. However, a key limitation is
their reliance on local neighborhoods, which leads to a lack of global
contextual understanding. Moreover, band correlation and data scarcity continue
to limit their performance. To mitigate these issues, we introduce DACN, a
dual-attention convolutional network for hyperspectral image super-resolution.
Specifically, the model first employs augmented convolutions, integrating
multi-head attention to effectively capture both local and global feature
dependencies. Next, we infer separate attention maps for the channel and
spatial dimensions to determine where to focus across different channels and
spatial positions. Furthermore, a custom optimized loss function is proposed
that combines L2 regularization with spatial-spectral gradient loss to ensure
accurate spectral fidelity. Experimental results on two hyperspectral datasets
demonstrate that the combination of multi-head attention and channel attention
outperforms either attention mechanism used individually.

Result: PixCell生成多样且高质量的图像，可用于训练自监督判别模型，支持数据增强和分子标记推断。

Conclusion: PixCell为计算病理学提供了强大的生成工具，加速研究并解决实际问题。

Abstract: The digitization of histology slides has revolutionized pathology, providing
massive datasets for cancer diagnosis and research. Contrastive self-supervised
and vision-language models have been shown to effectively mine large pathology
datasets to learn discriminative representations. On the other hand, generative
models, capable of synthesizing realistic and diverse images, present a
compelling solution to address unique problems in pathology that involve
synthesizing images; overcoming annotated data scarcity, enabling
privacy-preserving data sharing, and performing inherently generative tasks,
such as virtual staining. We introduce PixCell, the first diffusion-based
generative foundation model for histopathology. We train PixCell on PanCan-30M,
a vast, diverse dataset derived from 69,184 H\&E-stained whole slide images
covering various cancer types. We employ a progressive training strategy and a
self-supervision-based conditioning that allows us to scale up training without
any annotated data. PixCell generates diverse and high-quality images across
multiple cancer types, which we find can be used in place of real data to train
a self-supervised discriminative model. Synthetic images shared between
institutions are subject to fewer regulatory barriers than would be the case
with real clinical images. Furthermore, we showcase the ability to precisely
control image generation using a small set of annotated images, which can be
used for both data augmentation and educational purposes. Testing on a cell
segmentation task, a mask-guided PixCell enables targeted data augmentation,
improving downstream performance. Finally, we demonstrate PixCell's ability to
use H\&E structural staining to infer results from molecular marker studies; we
use this capability to infer IHC staining from H\&E images. Our trained models
are publicly released to accelerate research in computational pathology.

Motivation: 现有医学SSM在1D序列扁平化时会破坏空间结构，而传统解码器无法有效利用Mamba的状态传播能力。

Method: 采用四方向3D扫描的Mamba模块保持空间一致性，引入门控空间卷积增强特征表示，并设计Mamba驱动的解码框架实现跨尺度状态同步。

Result: 在Synapse和BraTS2023数据集上分别达到85.44%和90.22%的DSC，表现优异。

Conclusion: DM-SegNet通过创新设计在医学图像分割中实现了全局上下文建模与空间拓扑保持的平衡。

Abstract: Accurate 3D medical image segmentation demands architectures capable of
reconciling global context modeling with spatial topology preservation. While
State Space Models (SSMs) like Mamba show potential for sequence modeling,
existing medical SSMs suffer from encoder-decoder incompatibility: the
encoder's 1D sequence flattening compromises spatial structures, while
conventional decoders fail to leverage Mamba's state propagation. We present
DM-SegNet, a Dual-Mamba architecture integrating directional state transitions
with anatomy-aware hierarchical decoding. The core innovations include a
quadri-directional spatial Mamba module employing four-directional 3D scanning
to maintain anatomical spatial coherence, a gated spatial convolution layer
that enhances spatially sensitive feature representation prior to state
modeling, and a Mamba-driven decoding framework enabling bidirectional state
synchronization across scales. Extensive evaluation on two clinically
significant benchmarks demonstrates the efficacy of DM-SegNet: achieving
state-of-the-art Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 85.44% on the Synapse
dataset for abdominal organ segmentation and 90.22% on the BraTS2023 dataset
for brain tumor segmentation.

Conclusion: SSIMBaD框架在动漫面部上色中表现出色，且能泛化到多样风格。

Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion-based framework for automatic colorization of
Anime-style facial sketches. Our method preserves the structural fidelity of
the input sketch while effectively transferring stylistic attributes from a
reference image. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on predefined noise
schedules - which often compromise perceptual consistency -- our framework
builds on continuous-time diffusion models and introduces SSIMBaD (Sigma
Scaling with SSIM-Guided Balanced Diffusion). SSIMBaD applies a sigma-space
transformation that aligns perceptual degradation, as measured by structural
similarity (SSIM), in a linear manner. This scaling ensures uniform visual
difficulty across timesteps, enabling more balanced and faithful
reconstructions. Experiments on a large-scale Anime face dataset demonstrate
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models in both pixel accuracy and
perceptual quality, while generalizing to diverse styles. Code is available at

Result: 在多个基准测试中，方法生成的变形更符合用户意图，且引入的失真较低。

Conclusion: 该方法无需训练、高度自动化，能持续提供高质量的网格变形。

Abstract: Mesh deformation is a fundamental tool in 3D content manipulation. Despite
extensive prior research, existing approaches often suffer from low output
quality, require significant manual tuning, or depend on data-intensive
training. To address these limitations, we introduce a training-free,
handle-based mesh deformation method. % Our core idea is to leverage a
Vision-Language Model (VLM) to interpret and manipulate a handle-based
interface through prompt engineering. We begin by applying cone singularity
detection to identify a sparse set of potential handles. The VLM is then
prompted to select both the deformable sub-parts of the mesh and the handles
that best align with user instructions. Subsequently, we query the desired
deformed positions of the selected handles in screen space. To reduce
uncertainty inherent in VLM predictions, we aggregate the results from multiple
camera views using a novel multi-view voting scheme. % Across a suite of
benchmarks, our method produces deformations that align more closely with user
intent, as measured by CLIP and GPTEval3D scores, while introducing low
distortion -- quantified via membrane energy. In summary, our approach is
training-free, highly automated, and consistently delivers high-quality mesh
deformations.

Motivation: 现有方法将3D语义占据预测视为密集分割任务，忽视了实例级判别性，导致实例不完整和相邻模糊问题。论文发现体素级标签隐含实例级信息，并利用这一观察提出新方法。

Method: 提出VoxDet框架，包括：(a)空间解耦体素编码器生成任务特定特征，(b)任务解耦密集预测器通过偏移回归和语义预测实现实例感知预测。

Result: VoxDet在相机和LiDAR输入上均达到SOTA性能，在SemanticKITTI测试集上以63.0 IoU排名第一。

Conclusion: VoxDet通过实例中心的设计显著提升了3D语义占据预测的性能和效率。

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction aims to reconstruct the 3D geometry and
semantics of the surrounding environment. With dense voxel labels, prior works
typically formulate it as a dense segmentation task, independently classifying
each voxel. However, this paradigm neglects critical instance-centric
discriminability, leading to instance-level incompleteness and adjacent
ambiguities. To address this, we highlight a free lunch of occupancy labels:
the voxel-level class label implicitly provides insight at the instance level,
which is overlooked by the community. Motivated by this observation, we first
introduce a training-free Voxel-to-Instance (VoxNT) trick: a simple yet
effective method that freely converts voxel-level class labels into
instance-level offset labels. Building on this, we further propose VoxDet, an
instance-centric framework that reformulates the voxel-level occupancy
prediction as dense object detection by decoupling it into two sub-tasks:
offset regression and semantic prediction. Specifically, based on the lifted 3D
volume, VoxDet first uses (a) Spatially-decoupled Voxel Encoder to generate
disentangled feature volumes for the two sub-tasks, which learn task-specific
spatial deformation in the densely projected tri-perceptive space. Then, we
deploy (b) Task-decoupled Dense Predictor to address this task via dense
detection. Here, we first regress a 4D offset field to estimate distances (6
directions) between voxels and object borders in the voxel space. The regressed
offsets are then used to guide the instance-level aggregation in the
classification branch, achieving instance-aware prediction. Experiments show
that VoxDet can be deployed on both camera and LiDAR input, jointly achieving
state-of-the-art results on both benchmarks. VoxDet is not only highly
efficient, but also achieves 63.0 IoU on the SemanticKITTI test set, ranking
1st on the online leaderboard.

Result: 方案在速度和美学上优于现有技术，且对几何变换具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方案是一种高效且美观的多边形近似方法，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: This paper proposes a fast and unsupervised scheme for a polygonal
approximation of a closed digital curve. It is demonstrated that the
approximation scheme is faster than state-of-the-art approximation and is
competitive with the same in Rosin's measure and in its aesthetic aspect. The
scheme comprises of three phases: initial segmentation, iterative vertex
insertion, and iterative merging, followed by vertex adjustment. The initial
segmentation is used to detect sharp turnings - the vertices that seemingly
have high curvature. It is likely that some of important vertices with low
curvature might have been missed out at the first phase and so iterative vertex
insertion is used to add vertices in a region where the curvature changes
slowly but steadily. The initial phase may pick up some undesirable vertices
and so merging is used to eliminate the redundant vertices. Finally, vertex
adjustment is used to facilitate enhancement in the aesthetic look of the
approximation. The quality of the approximations is measured using Rosin's
measure. The robustness of the proposed scheme with respect to geometric
transformation is observed.

Conclusion: 该方法在静态和动态接触问题中表现优异，适用于弹性与非弹性材料，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: This work introduces a contact interaction methodology for an unbiased
treatment of contacting surfaces without assigning surfaces as master and
slave. The contact tractions between interacting discrete segments are
evaluated with respect to a midplane in a single pass, inherently maintaining
the equilibrium of tractions. These tractions are based on the penalisation of
true interpenetration between opposite surfaces, and the procedure of their
integral for discrete contacting segments is described in this paper. A
meticulous examination of the different possible geometric configurations of
interacting 3D segments is presented to develop visual understanding and better
traction evaluation accuracy. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed
method are validated against the analytical solutions of the contact patch
test, two-beam bending, Hertzian contact, and flat punch test, thus proving the
capability to reproduce contact between flat surfaces, curved surfaces, and
sharp corners in contact, respectively. The method passes the contact patch
test with the uniform transmission of contact pressure matching the accuracy
levels of finite elements. It converges towards the analytical solution with
mesh refinement and a suitably high penalty factor. The effectiveness of the
proposed algorithm also extends to self-contact problems and has been tested
for self-contact between flat and curved surfaces with inelastic material.
Dynamic problems of elastic and inelastic collisions between bars, as well as
oblique collisions of cylinders, are also presented. The ability of the
algorithm to resolve contacts between flat and curved surfaces for nonconformal
meshes with high accuracy demonstrates its versatility in general contact
problems.

Abstract: Neurosurgery increasingly uses Mixed Reality (MR) technologies for
intraoperative assistance. The greatest challenge in this area is mentally
reconstructing complex 3D anatomical structures from 2D slices with millimetric
precision, which is required in procedures like External Ventricular Drain
(EVD) placement. MR technologies have shown great potential in improving
surgical performance, however, their limited availability in clinical settings
underscores the need for training systems that foster skill retention in
unaided conditions. In this paper, we introduce NeuroMix, an MR-based simulator
for EVD placement. We conduct a study with 48 participants to assess the impact
of 2D and 3D visual aids on usability, cognitive load, technology acceptance,
and procedure precision and execution time. Three training modalities are
compared: one without visual aids, one with 2D aids only, and one combining
both 2D and 3D aids. The training phase takes place entirely on digital
objects, followed by a freehand EVD placement testing phase performed with a
physical catherer and a physical phantom without MR aids. We then compare the
participants performance with that of a control group that does not undergo
training. Our findings show that participants trained with both 2D and 3D aids
achieve a 44\% improvement in precision during unaided testing compared to the
control group, substantially higher than the improvement observed in the other
groups. All three training modalities receive high usability and technology
acceptance ratings, with significant equivalence across groups. The combination
of 2D and 3D visual aids does not significantly increase cognitive workload,
though it leads to longer operation times during freehand testing compared to
the control group.

Abstract: Randomly sampling points on surfaces is an essential operation in geometry
processing. This sampling is computationally straightforward on explicit
meshes, but it is much more difficult on other shape representations, such as
widely-used implicit surfaces. This work studies a simple and general scheme
for sampling points on a surface, which is derived from a connection to the
intersections of random rays with the surface. Concretely, given a subroutine
to cast a ray against a surface and find all intersections, we can use that
subroutine to uniformly sample white noise points on the surface. This approach
is particularly effective in the context of implicit signed distance functions,
where sphere marching allows us to efficiently cast rays and sample points,
without needing to extract an intermediate mesh. We analyze the basic method to
show that it guarantees uniformity, and find experimentally that it is
significantly more efficient than alternative strategies on a variety of
representations. Furthermore, we show extensions to blue noise sampling and
stratified sampling, and applications to deform neural implicit surfaces as
well as moment estimation.

Abstract: The presented approach aims at estimating the lateral variation of seismic
velocities for a seismic timelapse survey. The monitor survey is depth migrated
with the known velocity model of the base survey. An analysis is performed to
determine whether the moveout to be expected for the monitor survey after
residual prestack depth migration (RPSM) can be used for the velocity
determination of the formation of interest. In that case the migrated response
for the base horizon of the monitor survey is analyzed in order to determine
the velocity distribution by employing residual migration concepts. With the
use of Fresnel apertures a rather local application is possible at
comparatively low signal to noise ratios. The approach is successfully
demonstrated for two isotropic depth models both for a lens-like and for a
faulted reservoir structures. In both cases the velocities of the monitor
survey is recovered accurately. In addition it is demonstrated that an
iterative application is possible and that for these two models even severe
compaction of the model has little influence on the velocity estimation.

Abstract: Poroelasticity can be classified with geophysics and describes the
interaction between solids deformation and the pore pressure in a porous
medium. The investigation of this effect is anywhere interesting where a porous
medium and a fluid come together into play, for example this is the case in
geothermics. More precisely, it is an important aspect in reservoir management
since the replacement of the water in the reservoir some kilometers below the
Earth's surface has an effect on the surrounding material and of course
displacement of the solid increases or decreases the pore pressure. The
underlying physical processes are deduced with the help of linear elasticity,
conservation of linear momentum, conservation of mass and Darcy's law. They
result in partial differential equations, called the quasistatic equations of
poroelasticity (QEP). In this paper, we want to do a multiscale decomposition
of the components displacement and pore pressure. This should provide us with
more information about the data that means visualize underlying structures in
the different decomposition scales that cannot be seen in the whole data. The
aim is to detect interfaces and extract more details of the data. For this
purpose, we construct physically motivated scaling functions by mollifying the
appropriate fundamental solutions. Here we have a closer look at the scaling
functions fulfilling the necessary theoretical requirements of an approximate
identity. The corresponding wavelets are constructed by subtraction of two

Abstract: This work focuses on estimating soil properties from water moisture
measurements. We consider simulated data generated by solving the
initial-boundary value problem governing vertical infiltration in a
homogeneous, bounded soil profile, with the usage of the Fokas method. To
address the parameter identification problem, which is formulated as a
two-output regression task, we explore various machine learning models. The
performance of each model is assessed under different data conditions: full,
noisy, and limited. Overall, the prediction of diffusivity $D$ tends to be more
accurate than that of hydraulic conductivity $K.$ Among the models considered,
Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Neural Networks (NNs) demonstrate the
highest robustness, achieving near-perfect accuracy and minimal errors.

Result: 断层运动和几何形状对周围区域的位移、应力和应变有显著影响。

Conclusion: 研究结果有助于理解地下变形及其对断层运动的影响，对地震活动研究有贡献。

Abstract: In seismically active regions, the accumulation of geophysical stress during
the aseismic period and its impact on faults is crucial for identifying which
faults are more likely to undergo future fault movement. In this model, we
consider an infinite non-planar fault located in a viscoelastic half-space of a
fractional Maxwell medium representing the lithosphere-asthenosphere system
comprising three interconnected planar sections. The problem is formulated as a
two-dimensional boundary value problem with discontinuities along the fault
plane. A numerical solution is obtained using a Laplace transformation,
fractional derivative and the correspondence principle. The results have been
illustrated graphically using suitable model parameters. The computational
findings highlight the significant influence of fault movement and geometry on
displacement, stress and strain components in the region surrounding the fault
plane. A study has been carried out to investigate how non-planar faults
influence displacement and the accumulation of stress and strain. Analysis of
these results can provide insights into subsurface deformation and its impact
on fault movement, which may contribute to the study of earthquake activity.

Motivation: 研究科林斯裂谷断层段的地震复发时间及其概率分布，以理解断层行为差异。

Method: 通过分析断层段的复发时间，比较其与泊松模型的概率差异。

Result: 断层段复发时间差异大，部分段落的更新模型概率显著低于或高于泊松模型。

Conclusion: 科林斯裂谷断层段的复发行为复杂，需进一步研究其动力学机制。

Abstract: The M6.0 earthquakes recurrence times, Tr, exhibit high variability from 40

to 350 years and their antithetic ones ranging from 400 to 1500 years. The
fault segments in the Corinth Rift can be divided into three groups, according
to their recurrence behaviour, with some of them exhibiting significantly lower
renewal model probabilities than the Poisson model, others showing nearly equal
probabilities, and one segment where the renewal model probabilities are much
higher than the Poisson one.

TL;DR: 论文研究了Kefalonia转换断层带（KTFZ）的地震活动性及其构造背景，探讨了断层段之间的应力传递对强震分布的影响。


<details>

Motivation: KTFZ是地中海地震最活跃的区域，研究其构造活动和应力传递有助于理解该区域的长期构造加载机制。

Method: 通过分析历史地震数据和断层段的应力传递模型，研究KTFZ的地震活动性。

Result: 发现KTFZ的强震分布与断层段之间的应力传递密切相关。

Conclusion: 应力传递是理解KTFZ长期构造加载和地震活动性的关键因素。

Abstract: The Kefalonia Transform Fault Zone (KTFZ) is the most seismically active area
in the Mediterranean and consists of two major branches, the Lefkada fault
segment to the north and the Kefalonia fault segment to the south. KTFZ acts as
an active boundary between the subduction zone of the remnants of the oceanic
lithosphere of the Eastern Mediterranean that subducts under the Aegean
microplate to the south and the continental collision between the Eurasian
plate and the Adriatic Microplate to the north. The tectonic activity in the
region is reflected in the rapid crustal deformation rates of the region and
subsequently the frequent occurrence of strong earthquakes (Mw>6.0) that
occurred during both the historical and instrumental era of seismology. Those
strong earthquakes and their temporal distribution can be explained due to
stress transfer between closely located fault segments (Papadimitriou, 2002)
and as such, studying those stress interactions is an integral part of
understanding the long-term tectonic loading in the region.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于岩石的异质性，实验测试成本高且耗时，因此提出利用反应输运模型模拟高压力高温下硅酸盐页岩中的孔隙尺度反应和输运过程。

Method: 采用Crunch Tope模拟一维反应输运模型，研究Permian岩石样本在100°C和12.40 MPa下暴露于酸性盐水14和28天的反应。

Result: 结果显示石英相显著溶解后沉淀，黏土相沉淀和膨胀，长石相在酸性盐水-岩石界面附近溶解。孔隙度曲线显示14和28天后矿物沉淀约1.00%，不足以完全填充孔隙。

Conclusion: 反应输运模型能有效模拟页岩中CO2储存的化学-力学过程，但矿物沉淀量不足以完全封闭孔隙。

Abstract: This study examines the feasibility of carbon dioxide storage in shale rocks
and the reliability of reactive transport models in achieving accurate
replication of the chemo-mechanical interactions and transport processes
transpiring in these rocks when subjected to CO2 saturated brine. Owing to the
heterogeneity of rocks, experimental testing for adequate deductions and
findings, could be an expensive and time-intensive process. Therefore, this
study proposes utilization of reactive transport modeling to replicate the
pore-scale chemo-mechanical reactions and transport processes occurring in
silicate-rich shale rocks in the presence of CO2 saturated brine under high
pressure and high temperature. For this study, Crunch Tope has been adopted to
simulate a one-dimensional reactive transport model of a Permian rock specimen
exposed to the acidic brine at a temperature of 100 {\deg}C and pressure of
12.40 MPa (1800 psi) for a period of 14 and 28 days. The results demonstrated
significant dissolution followed by precipitation of quartz rich phases,
precipitation and swelling of clay rich phases, and dissolution of feldspar
rich phases closer to the acidic brine-rock interface. Moreover, porosity
against reaction depth curve showed nearly 1.00% mineral precipitation occur at
14 and 28 days, which is insufficient to completely fill the pore spaces.

TL;DR: YOTO方法通过一次性训练自动优化损失权重超参数，避免了多次训练，并在3D估计和语义分割任务中优于网格搜索方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型训练需要多次运行以优化损失权重，YOTO旨在通过一次性训练解决这一问题。

Method: 将损失权重超参数视为网络参数，通过梯度优化和软最大操作自动学习，并引入正则化损失确保权重均匀性和有界性。

Result: YOTO在3D估计和语义分割任务中优于网格搜索方法，表现更优。

Conclusion: YOTO提供了一种高效的一次性训练方法，显著减少了训练成本并提升了模型性能。

Abstract: The title of this paper is perhaps an overclaim. Of course, the process of
creating and optimizing a learned model inevitably involves multiple training
runs which potentially feature different architectural designs, input and
output encodings, and losses. However, our method, You Only Train Once (YOTO),
indeed contributes to limiting training to one shot for the latter aspect of
losses selection and weighting. We achieve this by automatically optimizing
loss weight hyperparameters of learned models in one shot via standard
gradient-based optimization, treating these hyperparameters as regular
parameters of the networks and learning them. To this end, we leverage the
differentiability of the composite loss formulation which is widely used for
optimizing multiple empirical losses simultaneously and model it as a novel
layer which is parameterized with a softmax operation that satisfies the
inherent positivity constraints on loss hyperparameters while avoiding
degenerate empirical gradients. We complete our joint end-to-end optimization
scheme by defining a novel regularization loss on the learned hyperparameters,
which models a uniformity prior among the employed losses while ensuring
boundedness of the identified optima. We evidence the efficacy of YOTO in
jointly optimizing loss hyperparameters and regular model parameters in one
shot by comparing it to the commonly used brute-force grid search across
state-of-the-art networks solving two key problems in computer vision, i.e. 3D
estimation and semantic segmentation, and showing that it consistently
outperforms the best grid-search model on unseen test data. Code will be made
publicly available.

Conclusion: StatsMerging是一种高效、通用的模型合并方法，适用于异构架构。

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a promising solution to accommodate multiple
large models within constrained memory budgets. We present StatsMerging, a
novel lightweight learning-based model merging method guided by weight
distribution statistics without requiring ground truth labels or test samples.
StatsMerging offers three key advantages: (1) It uniquely leverages singular
values from singular value decomposition (SVD) to capture task-specific weight
distributions, serving as a proxy for task importance to guide task coefficient
prediction; (2) It employs a lightweight learner StatsMergeLearner to model the
weight distributions of task-specific pre-trained models, improving
generalization and enhancing adaptation to unseen samples; (3) It introduces
Task-Specific Teacher Distillation for merging vision models with heterogeneous
architectures, a merging learning paradigm that avoids costly ground-truth
labels by task-specific teacher distillation. Notably, we present two types of
knowledge distillation, (a) distilling knowledge from task-specific models to
StatsMergeLearner; and (b) distilling knowledge from models with heterogeneous
architectures prior to merging. Extensive experiments across eight tasks
demonstrate the effectiveness of StatsMerging. Our results show that
StatsMerging outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of overall
accuracy, generalization to unseen tasks, and robustness to image quality
variations.

Motivation: 研究动机在于通过缩放定律的系统比较，避免基于单一参考尺度的误导性结论，从而更科学地选择和优化预训练模型与数据集。

Method: 方法包括基于密集测量的完整缩放定律推导，比较了CLIP和MaMMUT两种语言-视觉学习模型，并在多种下游任务和数据集上验证结果。

Result: 结果显示MaMMUT在扩展性和样本效率上优于CLIP，并在多个任务和数据集上表现一致。

Conclusion: 结论指出，准确的缩放定律推导为模型和数据集的系统性比较提供了有效工具，有助于开放基础模型和数据集的改进。

Abstract: In studies of transferable learning, scaling laws are obtained for various
important foundation models to predict their properties and performance at
larger scales. We show here how scaling law derivation can also be used for
model and dataset comparison, allowing to decide which procedure is to be
preferred for pre-training. For the first time, full scaling laws based on
dense measurements across a wide span of model and samples seen scales are
derived for two important language-vision learning procedures, CLIP and MaMMUT,
that use either contrastive only or contrastive and captioning text generative
loss. Ensuring sufficient prediction accuracy for held out points, we use
derived scaling laws to compare both models, obtaining evidence for MaMMUT's
stronger improvement with scale and better sample efficiency than standard
CLIP. To strengthen validity of the comparison, we show scaling laws for
various downstream tasks, classification, retrieval, and segmentation, and for
different open datasets, DataComp, DFN and Re-LAION, observing consistently the
same trends. We show that comparison can also be performed when deriving
scaling laws with a constant learning rate schedule, reducing compute cost.
Accurate derivation of scaling laws provides thus means to perform model and
dataset comparison across scale spans, avoiding misleading conclusions based on
measurements from single reference scales only, paving the road for systematic
comparison and improvement of open foundation models and datasets for their
creation. We release all the pre-trained models with their intermediate
checkpoints, including openMaMMUT-L/14, which achieves $80.3\%$ zero-shot
ImageNet-1k accuracy, trained on 12.8B samples from DataComp-1.4B. Code for
reproducing experiments in the paper and raw experiments data can be found at

Motivation: 能量模型（EBMs）在估计非归一化密度方面具有优势，但训练过程通常不稳定且困难。

Method: 通过最大化下界和最小化上界的双向边界方法训练EBMs，研究了四种不同的对数似然边界，并提供了评估这些边界的算法。

Result: 双向边界方法显著稳定了EBMs的训练，并实现了高质量的密度估计和样本生成。

Conclusion: 双向边界方法为EBMs的训练提供了一种稳定且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Energy-based models (EBMs) estimate unnormalized densities in an elegant
framework, but they are generally difficult to train. Recent work has linked
EBMs to generative adversarial networks, by noting that they can be trained
through a minimax game using a variational lower bound. To avoid the
instabilities caused by minimizing a lower bound, we propose to instead work
with bidirectional bounds, meaning that we maximize a lower bound and minimize
an upper bound when training the EBM. We investigate four different bounds on
the log-likelihood derived from different perspectives. We derive lower bounds
based on the singular values of the generator Jacobian and on mutual
information. To upper bound the negative log-likelihood, we consider a gradient
penalty-like bound, as well as one based on diffusion processes. In all cases,
we provide algorithms for evaluating the bounds. We compare the different
bounds to investigate, the pros and cons of the different approaches. Finally,
we demonstrate that the use of bidirectional bounds stabilizes EBM training and
yields high-quality density estimation and sample generation.

Result: AT初期模型学习更多跨类特征，后期转向类特定特征，导致鲁棒过拟合。

Conclusion: 研究为AT机制提供了新见解，统一了软标签训练和鲁棒过拟合的现有观点。

Abstract: Adversarial training (AT) has been considered one of the most effective
methods for making deep neural networks robust against adversarial attacks,
while the training mechanisms and dynamics of AT remain open research problems.
In this paper, we present a novel perspective on studying AT through the lens
of class-wise feature attribution. Specifically, we identify the impact of a
key family of features on AT that are shared by multiple classes, which we call
cross-class features. These features are typically useful for robust
classification, which we offer theoretical evidence to illustrate through a
synthetic data model. Through systematic studies across multiple model
architectures and settings, we find that during the initial stage of AT, the
model tends to learn more cross-class features until the best robustness
checkpoint. As AT further squeezes the training robust loss and causes robust
overfitting, the model tends to make decisions based on more class-specific
features. Based on these discoveries, we further provide a unified view of two
existing properties of AT, including the advantage of soft-label training and
robust overfitting. Overall, these insights refine the current understanding of
AT mechanisms and provide new perspectives on studying them. Our code is
available at https://github.com/PKU-ML/Cross-Class-Features-AT.

Conclusion: 框架为潜在空间对齐提供了新的理论支持和实证验证。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for aligning learnable latent spaces to
arbitrary target distributions by leveraging flow-based generative models as
priors. Our method first pretrains a flow model on the target features to
capture the underlying distribution. This fixed flow model subsequently
regularizes the latent space via an alignment loss, which reformulates the flow
matching objective to treat the latents as optimization targets. We formally
prove that minimizing this alignment loss establishes a computationally
tractable surrogate objective for maximizing a variational lower bound on the
log-likelihood of latents under the target distribution. Notably, the proposed
method eliminates computationally expensive likelihood evaluations and avoids
ODE solving during optimization. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate in a
controlled setting that the alignment loss landscape closely approximates the
negative log-likelihood of the target distribution. We further validate the
effectiveness of our approach through large-scale image generation experiments
on ImageNet with diverse target distributions, accompanied by detailed
discussions and ablation studies. With both theoretical and empirical
validation, our framework paves a new way for latent space alignment.

Abstract: Medical imaging segmentation is essential in clinical settings for diagnosing
diseases, planning surgeries, and other procedures. However, manual annotation
is a cumbersome and effortful task. To mitigate these aspects, this study
implements and evaluates the usability and clinical applicability of an
extended reality (XR)-based segmentation tool for anatomical CT scans, using
the Meta Quest 3 headset and Logitech MX Ink stylus. We develop an immersive
interface enabling real-time interaction with 2D and 3D medical imaging data in
a customizable workspace designed to mitigate workflow fragmentation and
cognitive demands inherent to conventional manual segmentation tools. The
platform combines stylus-driven annotation, mirroring traditional pen-on-paper
workflows, with instant 3D volumetric rendering. A user study with a public
craniofacial CT dataset demonstrated the tool's foundational viability,
achieving a System Usability Scale (SUS) score of 66, within the expected range
for medical applications. Participants highlighted the system's intuitive
controls (scoring 4.1/5 for self-descriptiveness on ISONORM metrics) and
spatial interaction design, with qualitative feedback highlighting strengths in
hybrid 2D/3D navigation and realistic stylus ergonomics. While users identified
opportunities to enhance task-specific precision and error management, the
platform's core workflow enabled dynamic slice adjustment, reducing cognitive
load compared to desktop tools. Results position the XR-stylus paradigm as a
promising foundation for immersive segmentation tools, with iterative
refinements targeting haptic feedback calibration and workflow personalization
to advance adoption in preoperative planning.

Result: 评测20多个主流MLLM，显示即使最先进模型在HSSBench上也面临显著挑战。

Conclusion: HSSBench有望推动MLLM跨学科推理能力的进一步研究。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
potential to advance a broad range of domains. However, current benchmarks for
evaluating MLLMs primarily emphasize general knowledge and vertical
step-by-step reasoning typical of STEM disciplines, while overlooking the
distinct needs and potential of the Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS). Tasks
in the HSS domain require more horizontal, interdisciplinary thinking and a
deep integration of knowledge across related fields, which presents unique
challenges for MLLMs, particularly in linking abstract concepts with
corresponding visual representations. Addressing this gap, we present HSSBench,
a dedicated benchmark designed to assess the capabilities of MLLMs on HSS tasks
in multiple languages, including the six official languages of the United
Nations. We also introduce a novel data generation pipeline tailored for HSS
scenarios, in which multiple domain experts and automated agents collaborate to
generate and iteratively refine each sample. HSSBench contains over 13,000
meticulously designed samples, covering six key categories. We benchmark more
than 20 mainstream MLLMs on HSSBench and demonstrate that it poses significant
challenges even for state-of-the-art models. We hope that this benchmark will
inspire further research into enhancing the cross-disciplinary reasoning
abilities of MLLMs, especially their capacity to internalize and connect
knowledge across fields.

Result: 自动收集的数据集在干净环境下表现与ASR相当，在嘈杂环境下显著优于ASR。

Conclusion: 该方法为扩展AVSR至更多语言（尤其是资源匮乏语言）提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) has gained significant attention
recently due to its robustness against noise, which often challenges
conventional speech recognition systems that rely solely on audio features.
Despite this advantage, AVSR models remain limited by the scarcity of extensive
datasets, especially for most languages beyond English. Automated data
collection offers a promising solution. This work presents a practical approach
to generate AVSR datasets from raw video, refining existing techniques for
improved efficiency and accessibility. We demonstrate its broad applicability
by developing a baseline AVSR model for Vietnamese. Experiments show the
automatically collected dataset enables a strong baseline, achieving
competitive performance with robust ASR in clean conditions and significantly
outperforming them in noisy environments like cocktail parties. This efficient
method provides a pathway to expand AVSR to more languages, particularly
under-resourced ones.

Method: MMRefine通过六种不同场景和六种错误类型评估MLLMs的细化能力，并对开放和封闭MLLMs进行实验。

Result: 实验揭示了影响细化性能的瓶颈和因素，指出了有效推理增强的改进方向。

Conclusion: MMRefine为MLLMs的错误细化能力提供了评估框架，并公开了代码和数据集。

Abstract: This paper introduces MMRefine, a MultiModal Refinement benchmark designed to
evaluate the error refinement capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs). As the emphasis shifts toward enhancing reasoning during inference,
MMRefine provides a framework that evaluates MLLMs' abilities to detect and
correct errors across six distinct scenarios beyond just comparing final
accuracy before and after refinement. Furthermore, the benchmark analyzes the
refinement performance by categorizing errors into six error types. Experiments
with various open and closed MLLMs reveal bottlenecks and factors impeding
refinement performance, highlighting areas for improvement in effective
reasoning enhancement. Our code and dataset are publicly available at

### [159] [Parking, Perception, and Retail: Street-Level Determinants of Community Vitality in Harbin](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05080)
*HaoTian Lan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种基于图像的可解释框架，分析中国哈尔滨社区街道的商业活力与街道特征（如停车密度、绿化、清洁度和街道宽度）的关系，发现车辆停放和街道宽度对商业活力和满意度有显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨社区街道的商业活力如何受车辆可达性、环境质量和行人感知的复杂互动影响，为城市设计和规划提供科学依据。

Method: 利用街景图像和多模态大语言模型（VisualGLM-6B）构建社区商业活力指数（CCVI），并通过GPT-4感知建模分析其与空间特征的关系。

Result: 适度车辆停放可提升商业可达性，但过度停车（尤其在窄街道）会降低步行性和满意度；绿化和清洁度显著提高满意度但对价格影响较弱；街道宽度调节车辆影响。

Conclusion: 研究展示了多模态AI与城市形态分析结合的价值，为社区振兴提供了理论和工具支持，对城市设计和停车管理有重要启示。

Abstract: The commercial vitality of community-scale streets in Chinese cities is
shaped by complex interactions between vehicular accessibility, environmental
quality, and pedestrian perception. This study proposes an interpretable,
image-based framework to examine how street-level features -- including parked
vehicle density, greenery, cleanliness, and street width -- impact retail
performance and user satisfaction in Harbin, China. Leveraging street view
imagery and a multimodal large language model (VisualGLM-6B), we construct a
Community Commercial Vitality Index (CCVI) from Meituan and Dianping data and
analyze its relationship with spatial attributes extracted via GPT-4-based
perception modeling. Our findings reveal that while moderate vehicle presence
may enhance commercial access, excessive on-street parking -- especially in
narrow streets -- erodes walkability and reduces both satisfaction and
shop-level pricing. In contrast, streets with higher perceived greenery and
cleanliness show significantly greater satisfaction scores but only weak
associations with pricing. Street width moderates the effects of vehicle
presence, underscoring the importance of spatial configuration. These results
demonstrate the value of integrating AI-assisted perception with urban
morphological analysis to capture non-linear and context-sensitive drivers of
commercial success. This study advances both theoretical and methodological
frontiers by highlighting the conditional role of vehicle activity in
neighborhood commerce and demonstrating the feasibility of multimodal AI for
perceptual urban diagnostics. The implications extend to urban design, parking
management, and scalable planning tools for community revitalization.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的实时图像重建方法，用于解决地面太阳望远镜观测中由大气湍流引起的图像退化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地面太阳望远镜观测受大气湍流影响，现有重建方法在强湍流和高计算成本下表现不佳。

Method: 采用无配对图像到图像转换的深度学习模型，以短曝光图像和斑点重建为参考进行训练。

Result: 方法在感知质量上表现更优，尤其在斑点重建存在伪影时，且能高效利用图像信息。

Conclusion: 该方法在提供完整图像序列时能实现最佳重建效果。

Abstract: Large aperture ground based solar telescopes allow the solar atmosphere to be
resolved in unprecedented detail. However, observations are limited by Earths
turbulent atmosphere, requiring post image corrections. Current reconstruction
methods using short exposure bursts face challenges with strong turbulence and
high computational costs. We introduce a deep learning approach that
reconstructs 100 short exposure images into one high quality image in real
time. Using unpaired image to image translation, our model is trained on
degraded bursts with speckle reconstructions as references, improving
robustness and generalization. Our method shows an improved robustness in terms
of perceptual quality, especially when speckle reconstructions show artifacts.
An evaluation with a varying number of images per burst demonstrates that our
method makes efficient use of the combined image information and achieves the
best reconstructions when provided with the full image burst.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学AI系统常缺乏系统的领域专业知识整合，可能影响诊断可靠性，因此需要一种能够整合临床知识和AI技术的方法。

Method: 研究开发了一个基于本体的框架，包括分层神经网络架构、本体增强的视觉问答系统和多模态深度学习模型，结合了影像、临床和实验室数据。

Conclusion: 尽管理论框架已建立，但实验验证仍需进一步的数据集和计算资源支持，未来工作将集中于数据扩展和系统验证。

Abstract: Medical artificial intelligence (AI) systems frequently lack systematic
domain expertise integration, potentially compromising diagnostic reliability.
This study presents an ontology-based framework for bone disease diagnosis,
developed in collaboration with Ho Chi Minh City Hospital for Traumatology and
Orthopedics. The framework introduces three theoretical contributions: (1) a
hierarchical neural network architecture guided by bone disease ontology for
segmentation-classification tasks, incorporating Visual Language Models (VLMs)
through prompts, (2) an ontology-enhanced Visual Question Answering (VQA)
system for clinical reasoning, and (3) a multimodal deep learning model that
integrates imaging, clinical, and laboratory data through ontological
relationships. The methodology maintains clinical interpretability through
systematic knowledge digitization, standardized medical terminology mapping,
and modular architecture design. The framework demonstrates potential for
extension beyond bone diseases through its standardized structure and reusable
components. While theoretical foundations are established, experimental
validation remains pending due to current dataset and computational resource
limitations. Future work will focus on expanding the clinical dataset and
conducting comprehensive system validation.

TL;DR: RoboRefer是一种3D感知的视觉语言模型，通过监督微调（SFT）和强化微调（RFT）提升空间理解和多步推理能力，在RefSpatial-Bench上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在复杂3D场景理解和动态空间推理方面表现不足，RoboRefer旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 结合SFT和RFT训练，使用RefSpatial数据集（20M QA对）和RefSpatial-Bench评估。

Result: SFT训练的RoboRefer空间理解成功率89.6%，RFT训练后进一步超越其他基线，包括Gemini-2.5-Pro。

Conclusion: RoboRefer在空间推理任务中表现卓越，并能与多种机器人控制策略集成，适用于复杂现实场景。

Abstract: Spatial referring is a fundamental capability of embodied robots to interact
with the 3D physical world. However, even with the powerful pretrained vision
language models (VLMs), recent approaches are still not qualified to accurately
understand the complex 3D scenes and dynamically reason about the
instruction-indicated locations for interaction. To this end, we propose
RoboRefer, a 3D-aware VLM that can first achieve precise spatial understanding
by integrating a disentangled but dedicated depth encoder via supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). Moreover, RoboRefer advances generalized multi-step spatial
reasoning via reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), with metric-sensitive process
reward functions tailored for spatial referring tasks. To support SFT and RFT
training, we introduce RefSpatial, a large-scale dataset of 20M QA pairs (2x
prior), covering 31 spatial relations (vs. 15 prior) and supporting complex
reasoning processes (up to 5 steps). In addition, we introduce
RefSpatial-Bench, a challenging benchmark filling the gap in evaluating spatial
referring with multi-step reasoning. Experiments show that SFT-trained
RoboRefer achieves state-of-the-art spatial understanding, with an average
success rate of 89.6%. RFT-trained RoboRefer further outperforms all other
baselines by a large margin, even surpassing Gemini-2.5-Pro by 17.4% in average
accuracy on RefSpatial-Bench. Notably, RoboRefer can be integrated with various
control policies to execute long-horizon, dynamic tasks across diverse robots
(e,g., UR5, G1 humanoid) in cluttered real-world scenes.

TL;DR: SPARTA是一种基于点云的、估计角度依赖地形可通行性的方法，通过输出平滑的解析函数来预测风险分布，显著提高了效率和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 越野自主性中，地形可通行性常依赖于车辆状态（如接近角度），传统方法需要大量数据和重复计算，效率低下。

Method: SPARTA通过几何结构网络输出基于傅里叶基函数的平滑解析函数，预测任意接近角度的风险分布，减少计算开销。

Result: 在高保真模拟中，SPARTA成功穿越40米巨石场的成功率达91%（基线为73%），并在硬件测试中展示了泛化能力。

Conclusion: SPARTA通过高效的角度依赖可通行性估计，显著提升了越野自主性的性能，适用于实际场景。

Abstract: A key open challenge in off-road autonomy is that the traversability of
terrain often depends on the vehicle's state. In particular, some obstacles are
only traversable from some orientations. However, learning this interaction by
encoding the angle of approach as a model input demands a large and diverse
training dataset and is computationally inefficient during planning due to
repeated model inference. To address these challenges, we present SPARTA, a
method for estimating approach angle conditioned traversability from point
clouds. Specifically, we impose geometric structure into our network by
outputting a smooth analytical function over the 1-Sphere that predicts risk
distribution for any angle of approach with minimal overhead and can be reused
for subsequent queries. The function is composed of Fourier basis functions,
which has important advantages for generalization due to their periodic nature
and smoothness. We demonstrate SPARTA both in a high-fidelity simulation
platform, where our model achieves a 91\% success rate crossing a 40m boulder
field (compared to 73\% for the baseline), and on hardware, illustrating the
generalization ability of the model to real-world settings.

Abstract: The use of robotics in humanitarian demining increasingly involves computer
vision techniques to improve landmine detection capabilities. However, in the
absence of diverse and realistic datasets, the reliable validation of
algorithms remains a challenge for the research community. In this paper, we
introduce MineInsight, a publicly available multi-sensor, multi-spectral
dataset designed for off-road landmine detection. The dataset features 35
different targets (15 landmines and 20 commonly found objects) distributed
along three distinct tracks, providing a diverse and realistic testing
environment. MineInsight is, to the best of our knowledge, the first dataset to
integrate dual-view sensor scans from both an Unmanned Ground Vehicle and its
robotic arm, offering multiple viewpoints to mitigate occlusions and improve
spatial awareness. It features two LiDARs, as well as images captured at
diverse spectral ranges, including visible (RGB, monochrome), visible
short-wave infrared (VIS-SWIR), and long-wave infrared (LWIR). Additionally,
the dataset comes with an estimation of the location of the targets, offering a
benchmark for evaluating detection algorithms. We recorded approximately one
hour of data in both daylight and nighttime conditions, resulting in around
38,000 RGB frames, 53,000 VIS-SWIR frames, and 108,000 LWIR frames. MineInsight
serves as a benchmark for developing and evaluating landmine detection
algorithms. Our dataset is available at

Abstract: Annotated datasets are critical for training neural networks for object
detection, yet their manual creation is time- and labour-intensive, subjective
to human error, and often limited in diversity. This challenge is particularly
pronounced in the domain of robotics, where diverse and dynamic scenarios
further complicate the creation of representative datasets. To address this, we
propose a novel method for automatically generating annotated synthetic data in
Unreal Engine. Our approach leverages photorealistic 3D Gaussian splats for
rapid synthetic data generation. We demonstrate that synthetic datasets can
achieve performance comparable to that of real-world datasets while
significantly reducing the time required to generate and annotate data.
Additionally, combining real-world and synthetic data significantly increases
object detection performance by leveraging the quality of real-world images
with the easier scalability of synthetic data. To our knowledge, this is the
first application of synthetic data for training object detection algorithms in
the highly dynamic and varied environment of robot soccer. Validation
experiments reveal that a detector trained on synthetic images performs on par
with one trained on manually annotated real-world images when tested on robot
soccer match scenarios. Our method offers a scalable and comprehensive
alternative to traditional dataset creation, eliminating the labour-intensive
error-prone manual annotation process. By generating datasets in a simulator
where all elements are intrinsically known, we ensure accurate annotations
while significantly reducing manual effort, which makes it particularly
valuable for robotics applications requiring diverse and scalable training
data.

TL;DR: 论文提出CMIE框架，通过生成共存关系和关联评分机制，解决多模态大语言模型在检测上下文无关虚假信息时的深层关系捕捉和噪声问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM在检测上下文无关虚假信息时，难以捕捉图像与文本间的深层语义关联，且证据噪声影响准确性。

Method: 提出CMIE框架，包含共存关系生成（CRG）策略和关联评分（AS）机制，识别图像与文本的共存关系并选择性利用证据。

Result: 实验表明CMIE优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CMIE有效提升了上下文无关虚假信息的检测能力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in visual reasoning and text generation. While previous studies
have explored the application of MLLM for detecting out-of-context (OOC)
misinformation, our empirical analysis reveals two persisting challenges of
this paradigm. Evaluating the representative GPT-4o model on direct reasoning
and evidence augmented reasoning, results indicate that MLLM struggle to
capture the deeper relationships-specifically, cases in which the image and
text are not directly connected but are associated through underlying semantic
links. Moreover, noise in the evidence further impairs detection accuracy. To
address these challenges, we propose CMIE, a novel OOC misinformation detection
framework that incorporates a Coexistence Relationship Generation (CRG)
strategy and an Association Scoring (AS) mechanism. CMIE identifies the
underlying coexistence relationships between images and text, and selectively
utilizes relevant evidence to enhance misinformation detection. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods.
