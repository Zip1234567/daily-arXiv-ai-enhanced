Motivation: 现有基准主要关注问题解决，而本文旨在评估模型对学生解答的理解、错误识别及按固定标准评分的能力。

Method: 收集了122份俄罗斯统一国家考试（EGE）的手写解答及专家评分，评估了七种现代VLMs在三种推理模式下的表现。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel benchmark, EGE-Math Solutions Assessment
Benchmark, for evaluating Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on their ability to
assess hand-written mathematical solutions. Unlike existing benchmarks that
focus on problem solving, our approach centres on understanding student
solutions, identifying mistakes, and assigning grades according to fixed
criteria. We compile 122 scanned solutions from the Russian Unified State Exam
(EGE) together with official expert grades, and evaluate seven modern VLMs from
Google, OpenAI, Arcee AI, and Alibaba Cloud in three inference modes. The
results reveal current limitations in mathematical reasoning and human-rubric
alignment, opening new research avenues in AI-assisted assessment. You can find

### [2] [Robust and Efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting for Urban Scene Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23006)
*Zhensheng Yuan,Haozhi Huang,Zhen Xiong,Di Wang,Guanghua Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种快速重建和实时渲染城市规模场景的框架，通过并行训练和可控细节策略优化效率与质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多视角捕获中外观变化导致的鲁棒性问题，同时提升重建和渲染的效率。

Method: 采用场景分区并行训练、可见性图像选择、可控细节策略和外观变换模块，结合增强模块提升重建质量。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在城市规模场景重建中效率和视觉质量均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架在保持高视觉保真度的同时，实现了高效的城市规模场景重建与渲染。

Abstract: We present a framework that enables fast reconstruction and real-time
rendering of urban-scale scenes while maintaining robustness against appearance
variations across multi-view captures. Our approach begins with scene
partitioning for parallel training, employing a visibility-based image
selection strategy to optimize training efficiency. A controllable
level-of-detail (LOD) strategy explicitly regulates Gaussian density under a
user-defined budget, enabling efficient training and rendering while
maintaining high visual fidelity. The appearance transformation module
mitigates the negative effects of appearance inconsistencies across images
while enabling flexible adjustments. Additionally, we utilize enhancement
modules, such as depth regularization, scale regularization, and antialiasing,
to improve reconstruction fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method effectively reconstructs urban-scale scenes and outperforms previous
approaches in both efficiency and quality. The source code is available at:

### [3] [Modeling Human Gaze Behavior with Diffusion Models for Unified Scanpath Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23021)
*Giuseppe Cartella,Vittorio Cuculo,Alessandro D'Amelio,Marcella Cornia,Giuseppe Boccignone,Rita Cucchiara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ScanDiff结合扩散模型和Vision Transformers，生成多样且真实的人类注视扫描路径，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法生成平均行为，无法捕捉人类视觉探索的变异性。

Method: 结合扩散模型和Vision Transformers，利用扩散模型的随机性生成多样扫描路径，并引入文本条件实现任务驱动生成。

Result: 在基准数据集上，ScanDiff在自由观看和任务驱动场景中均优于现有方法，生成更多样且准确的扫描路径。

Conclusion: ScanDiff能更好地捕捉人类视觉行为的复杂性，推动注视预测研究。

Abstract: Predicting human gaze scanpaths is crucial for understanding visual
attention, with applications in human-computer interaction, autonomous systems,
and cognitive robotics. While deep learning models have advanced scanpath
prediction, most existing approaches generate averaged behaviors, failing to
capture the variability of human visual exploration. In this work, we present
ScanDiff, a novel architecture that combines diffusion models with Vision
Transformers to generate diverse and realistic scanpaths. Our method explicitly
models scanpath variability by leveraging the stochastic nature of diffusion
models, producing a wide range of plausible gaze trajectories. Additionally, we
introduce textual conditioning to enable task-driven scanpath generation,
allowing the model to adapt to different visual search objectives. Experiments
on benchmark datasets show that ScanDiff surpasses state-of-the-art methods in
both free-viewing and task-driven scenarios, producing more diverse and
accurate scanpaths. These results highlight its ability to better capture the
complexity of human visual behavior, pushing forward gaze prediction research.

### [4] [Recovering Diagnostic Value: Super-Resolution-Aided Echocardiographic Classification in Resource-Constrained Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23027)
*Krishan Agyakari Raja Babu,Om Prabhu,Annu,Mohanasankar Sivaprakasam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了深度学习超分辨率技术在低质量超声心动图中的应用，显著提升了分类任务的准确性，尤其在资源有限的环境中具有实用价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源有限的环境中，低质量的超声心动图限制了诊断模型的效能，而超分辨率技术在其他医学影像中表现良好，但在超声心动图中尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用CAMUS数据集，按图像质量分层，评估了两种分类任务（2CH vs. 4CH和ED vs. ES），并应用SRGAN和SRResNet模型增强图像质量。

Result: SRResNet在提升分类准确性方面表现显著，且计算效率高。

Conclusion: 超分辨率技术能有效恢复低质量超声心动图的诊断价值，为资源有限环境中的AI辅助诊断提供了可行工具。

Abstract: Automated cardiac interpretation in resource-constrained settings (RCS) is
often hindered by poor-quality echocardiographic imaging, limiting the
effectiveness of downstream diagnostic models. While super-resolution (SR)
techniques have shown promise in enhancing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
computed tomography (CT) scans, their application to echocardiography-a widely
accessible but noise-prone modality-remains underexplored. In this work, we
investigate the potential of deep learning-based SR to improve classification
accuracy on low-quality 2D echocardiograms. Using the publicly available CAMUS
dataset, we stratify samples by image quality and evaluate two clinically
relevant tasks of varying complexity: a relatively simple Two-Chamber vs.
Four-Chamber (2CH vs. 4CH) view classification and a more complex End-Diastole
vs. End-Systole (ED vs. ES) phase classification. We apply two widely used SR
models-Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) and
Super-Resolution Residual Network (SRResNet), to enhance poor-quality images
and observe significant gains in performance metric-particularly with SRResNet,
which also offers computational efficiency. Our findings demonstrate that SR
can effectively recover diagnostic value in degraded echo scans, making it a
viable tool for AI-assisted care in RCS, achieving more with less.

### [5] [Adaptive Time-step Training for Enhancing Spike-Based Neural Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23033)
*Ranxi Lin,Canming Yao,Jiayi Li,Weihang Liu,Xin Lou,Pingqiang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于脉冲神经网络的动态时间步长训练策略（PATA），用于神经辐射场（NeRF）模型，以在保持渲染质量的同时减少计算资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NeRF模型在训练和推理时依赖密集点采样，计算量大，限制了其在资源受限场景中的应用。脉冲神经网络（SNN）因其高效能特性成为替代方案。

Method: 提出PATA框架，结合动态时间步长训练策略，自动平衡渲染质量和时间步长，实现场景自适应推理。

Result: 实验表明，PATA在保持渲染质量的同时，减少推理时间步长64%和运行功耗61.55%。

Conclusion: PATA为NeRF模型在资源受限场景中的应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based models have achieved remarkable success
in 3D reconstruction and rendering tasks. However, during both training and
inference, these models rely heavily on dense point sampling along rays from
multiple viewpoints, resulting in a surge in floating-point operations and
severely limiting their use in resource-constrained scenarios like edge
computing. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), which communicate via binary spikes
over discrete time steps, offer a promising alternative due to their
energy-efficient nature. Given the inherent variability in scene scale and
texture complexity in neural rendering and the prevailing practice of training
separate models per scene, we propose a spike-based NeRF framework with a
dynamic time step training strategy, termed Pretrain-Adaptive Time-step
Adjustment (PATA). This approach automatically explores the trade-off between
rendering quality and time step length during training. Consequently, it
enables scene-adaptive inference with variable time steps and reduces the
additional consumption of computational resources in the inference process.
Anchoring to the established Instant-NGP architecture, we evaluate our method
across diverse datasets. The experimental results show that PATA can preserve
rendering fidelity while reducing inference time steps by 64\% and running
power by 61.55\%.

### [6] [Early Goal-Guided Multi-Scale Fusion for Real-Time Vision-Language Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23042)
*Santosh Patapati,Trisanth Srinivasan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NovaDrive是一种单分支视觉语言架构，通过处理多模态输入（图像、地图、LiDAR和文本路径点）实现高效自动驾驶，提升成功率和路径效率，同时减少碰撞频率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆需在毫秒内反应并处理复杂路况，现有方法常依赖循环记忆，效率不足。

Method: 采用单分支架构，结合两阶段交叉注意力块对齐路径点与地图，并细化图像和深度补丁的注意力，辅以平滑损失函数避免突变。

Result: 在nuScenes/Waymo子集上，成功率提升4%，路径效率提升0.11，碰撞频率降低1.4%。

Conclusion: NovaDrive通过多模态融合和部分VLM微调显著提升性能，且设计可扩展至其他具身AI领域。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles must react in milliseconds while reasoning about road
geometry and traffic intent to navigate complex situations. We introduce
NovaDrive, a single-branch vision-language architecture that processes
front-camera images, HD-map tiles, LiDAR depth, and textual waypoints in a
single branch. A lightweight, two-stage cross-attention block first aligns
waypoint tokens with the HD map, then refines attention over fine-grained image
and depth patches. Coupled with a novel smoothness loss that discourages abrupt
steering and speed changes, this design eliminates the need for recurrent
memory. We fine-tune the top 15 layers of an 11B LLaMA-3.2 vision-language
backbone, enabling real-time inference. On the nuScenes / Waymo subset of the
MD-NEX Outdoor benchmark, NovaDrive raises success rate to 84% (+4%), boosts
path-efficiency (SPL) to 0.66 (+0.11), and reduces collision frequency from
2.6% to 1.2% (-1.4%) relative to the previous state-of-the-art. Our ablations
confirm that waypoint tokens, partial VLM fine-tuning, and the cross-attention
fusion each contribute the most to these gains. Beyond safety, NovaDrive's
shorter routes (resulting from the novel smoothness loss) translate to lower
fuel or battery usage, pointing toward leaner, more easily updated driving
stacks. NovaDrive can be extended to other embodied-AI domains as well.

### [7] [Reference-Guided Diffusion Inpainting For Multimodal Counterfactual Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23058)
*Alexandru Buburuzan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了两种新的合成数据生成方法MObI和AnydoorMed，分别用于自动驾驶和医学图像分析，通过扩散模型实现高真实感和可控性的多模态数据生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于真实数据采集成本高且复杂，合成数据方法在安全关键应用中越来越重要，但需要高真实感和可控性。

Method: MObI利用扩散模型实现多模态对象修复，支持3D定位和语义一致性；AnydoorMed扩展至医学图像，通过扩散模型修复异常并保持结构完整性。

Result: 两种方法展示了在多模态场景中生成高真实感、可控的合成数据的能力。

Conclusion: 这些方法表明参考引导修复的基础模型可适应多种感知模态，为构建高度真实和可控的多模态反事实场景铺平道路。

Abstract: Safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving and medical image
analysis, require extensive multimodal data for rigorous testing. Synthetic
data methods are gaining prominence due to the cost and complexity of gathering
real-world data, but they demand a high degree of realism and controllability
to be useful. This work introduces two novel methods for synthetic data
generation in autonomous driving and medical image analysis, namely MObI and
AnydoorMed, respectively. MObI is a first-of-its-kind framework for Multimodal
Object Inpainting that leverages a diffusion model to produce realistic and
controllable object inpaintings across perceptual modalities, demonstrated
simultaneously for camera and lidar. Given a single reference RGB image, MObI
enables seamless object insertion into existing multimodal scenes at a
specified 3D location, guided by a bounding box, while maintaining semantic
consistency and multimodal coherence. Unlike traditional inpainting methods
that rely solely on edit masks, this approach uses 3D bounding box conditioning
to ensure accurate spatial positioning and realistic scaling. AnydoorMed
extends this paradigm to the medical imaging domain, focusing on
reference-guided inpainting for mammography scans. It leverages a
diffusion-based model to inpaint anomalies with impressive detail preservation,
maintaining the reference anomaly's structural integrity while semantically
blending it with the surrounding tissue. Together, these methods demonstrate
that foundation models for reference-guided inpainting in natural images can be
readily adapted to diverse perceptual modalities, paving the way for the next
generation of systems capable of constructing highly realistic, controllable
and multimodal counterfactual scenarios.

### [8] [Vision-Language Fusion for Real-Time Autonomous Driving: Goal-Centered Cross-Attention of Camera, HD-Map, & Waypoints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23064)
*Santosh Patapati,Trisanth Srinivasan,Murari Ambati*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XYZ-Drive是一个结合视觉和语言的单模型，通过融合摄像头、地图和路径点数据，实现自动驾驶的高效导航和解释能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶需要几何精度和语义理解，但现有方法通常分开处理。XYZ-Drive旨在通过单一模型整合这些需求。

Method: 使用轻量级目标中心交叉注意力层融合摄像头帧、地图和路径点数据，并通过部分微调的LLaMA-3.2 11B模型输出控制指令。

Result: 在MD-NEX基准测试中，XYZ-Drive达到95%的成功率和0.80 SPL，优于PhysNav-DG 15%，碰撞率减半。

Conclusion: 早期令牌级融合意图和地图布局能实现准确、透明且实时的驾驶。

Abstract: Autonomous cars need geometric accuracy and semantic understanding to
navigate complex environments, yet most stacks handle them separately. We
present XYZ-Drive, a single vision-language model that reads a front-camera
frame, a 25m $\times$ 25m overhead map, and the next waypoint, then outputs
steering and speed. A lightweight goal-centered cross-attention layer lets
waypoint tokens highlight relevant image and map patches, supporting both
action and textual explanations, before the fused tokens enter a partially
fine-tuned LLaMA-3.2 11B model.
  On the MD-NEX Outdoor-Driving benchmark XYZ-Drive attains 95% success and
0.80 Success weighted by Path Length (SPL), surpassing PhysNav-DG by 15%. and
halving collisions, all while significantly improving efficiency by using only
a single branch. Sixteen ablations explain the gains. Removing any modality
(vision, waypoint, map) drops success by up to 11%, confirming their
complementary roles and rich connections. Replacing goal-centered attention
with simple concatenation cuts 3% in performance, showing query-based fusion
injects map knowledge more effectively. Keeping the transformer frozen loses
5%, showing the importance of fine-tuning when applying VLMs for specific tasks
such as autonomous driving. Coarsening map resolution from 10 cm to 40 cm blurs
lane edges and raises crash rate.
  Overall, these results demonstrate that early, token-level fusion of intent
and map layout enables accurate, transparent, real-time driving.

### [9] [Vocabulary-free Fine-grained Visual Recognition via Enriched Contextually Grounded Vision-Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23070)
*Dmitry Demidov,Zaigham Zaheer,Omkar Thawakar,Salman Khan,Fahad Shahbaz Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无需训练的细粒度图像分类方法E-FineR，结合语言模型和视觉语言模型，实现了开放集识别，并在零样本和少样本分类中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统细粒度图像分类方法依赖固定词汇和封闭集分类，难以适应新类别。现有方法未能充分利用语言模型潜力且依赖猜测的类别名称。

Method: 提出E-FineR方法，无需训练，结合LLMs和VLMs，通过语言驱动理解实现细粒度分类。

Result: E-FineR在细粒度视觉识别中达到SOTA，并在零样本和少样本分类中表现优异。

Conclusion: E-FineR推动了图像分类从固定标签预测向灵活语言驱动理解的转变，适用于实际场景和新领域。

Abstract: Fine-grained image classification, the task of distinguishing between
visually similar subcategories within a broader category (e.g., bird species,
car models, flower types), is a challenging computer vision problem.
Traditional approaches rely heavily on fixed vocabularies and closed-set
classification paradigms, limiting their scalability and adaptability in
real-world settings where novel classes frequently emerge. Recent research has
demonstrated that combining large language models (LLMs) with vision-language
models (VLMs) makes open-set recognition possible without the need for
predefined class labels. However, the existing methods are often limited in
harnessing the power of LLMs at the classification phase, and also rely heavily
on the guessed class names provided by an LLM without thorough analysis and
refinement. To address these bottlenecks, we propose our training-free method,
Enriched-FineR (or E-FineR for short), which demonstrates state-of-the-art
results in fine-grained visual recognition while also offering greater
interpretability, highlighting its strong potential in real-world scenarios and
new domains where expert annotations are difficult to obtain. Additionally, we
demonstrate the application of our proposed approach to zero-shot and few-shot
classification, where it demonstrated performance on par with the existing SOTA
while being training-free and not requiring human interventions. Overall, our
vocabulary-free framework supports the shift in image classification from rigid
label prediction to flexible, language-driven understanding, enabling scalable
and generalizable systems for real-world applications. Well-documented code is
available on https://github.com/demidovd98/e-finer.

### [10] [Details Matter for Indoor Open-vocabulary 3D Instance Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23134)
*Sanghun Jung,Jingjing Zheng,Ke Zhang,Nan Qiao,Albert Y. C. Chen,Lu Xia,Chi Liu,Yuyin Sun,Xiao Zeng,Hsiang-Wei Huang,Byron Boots,Min Sun,Cheng-Hao Kuo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的开放词汇3D实例分割方法，通过结合和优化现有概念，实现了两阶段方案：3D提案生成和实例分类，性能超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开放词汇3D实例分割方法中的概念互补但未结合，需解决关键挑战以提升性能。

Method: 采用两阶段方案：1) 3D提案生成（基于跟踪的聚合与迭代合并/移除）；2) 实例分类（使用Alpha-CLIP和标准化最大相似度评分）。

Result: 在ScanNet200和S3DIS数据集上，所有AP和AR指标均达到最优，甚至超过封闭词汇方法。

Conclusion: 通过结合互补概念和优化设计，提出的方法在开放词汇3D实例分割中实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Unlike closed-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation that is often trained
end-to-end, open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation (OV-3DIS) often leverages
vision-language models (VLMs) to generate 3D instance proposals and classify
them. While various concepts have been proposed from existing research, we
observe that these individual concepts are not mutually exclusive but
complementary. In this paper, we propose a new state-of-the-art solution for
OV-3DIS by carefully designing a recipe to combine the concepts together and
refining them to address key challenges. Our solution follows the two-stage
scheme: 3D proposal generation and instance classification. We employ robust 3D
tracking-based proposal aggregation to generate 3D proposals and remove
overlapped or partial proposals by iterative merging/removal. For the
classification stage, we replace the standard CLIP model with Alpha-CLIP, which
incorporates object masks as an alpha channel to reduce background noise and
obtain object-centric representation. Additionally, we introduce the
standardized maximum similarity (SMS) score to normalize text-to-proposal
similarity, effectively filtering out false positives and boosting precision.
Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet200 and S3DIS
across all AP and AR metrics, even surpassing an end-to-end closed-vocabulary
method.

### [11] [X-NeMo: Expressive Neural Motion Reenactment via Disentangled Latent Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23143)
*Xiaochen Zhao,Hongyi Xu,Guoxian Song,You Xie,Chenxu Zhang,Xiu Li,Linjie Luo,Jinli Suo,Yebin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: X-NeMo是一种基于扩散的零样本肖像动画方法，通过驱动视频的面部运动生成静态肖像动画，解决了身份泄漏和表情捕捉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法中的身份泄漏和难以捕捉细微及极端表情的问题。

Method: 提出端到端训练框架，提取1D身份无关运动描述符，通过交叉注意力控制图像生成。

Result: X-NeMo在实验中表现优于现有方法，生成高表现力动画并保持身份相似性。

Conclusion: X-NeMo通过创新的运动描述符和训练框架，显著提升了肖像动画的质量和身份保留能力。

Abstract: We propose X-NeMo, a novel zero-shot diffusion-based portrait animation
pipeline that animates a static portrait using facial movements from a driving
video of a different individual. Our work first identifies the root causes of
the key issues in prior approaches, such as identity leakage and difficulty in
capturing subtle and extreme expressions. To address these challenges, we
introduce a fully end-to-end training framework that distills a 1D
identity-agnostic latent motion descriptor from driving image, effectively
controlling motion through cross-attention during image generation. Our
implicit motion descriptor captures expressive facial motion in fine detail,
learned end-to-end from a diverse video dataset without reliance on pretrained
motion detectors. We further enhance expressiveness and disentangle motion
latents from identity cues by supervising their learning with a dual GAN
decoder, alongside spatial and color augmentations. By embedding the driving
motion into a 1D latent vector and controlling motion via cross-attention
rather than additive spatial guidance, our design eliminates the transmission
of spatial-aligned structural clues from the driving condition to the diffusion
backbone, substantially mitigating identity leakage. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that X-NeMo surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, producing highly
expressive animations with superior identity resemblance. Our code and models
are available for research.

### [12] [Neural Multi-View Self-Calibrated Photometric Stereo without Photometric Stereo Cues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23162)
*Xu Cao,Takafumi Taketomi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种神经逆渲染方法，从多视角图像中联合重建几何、空间变化反射率和光照条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要光照校准或中间线索（如每视角法线图），而本方法直接从原始图像中联合优化所有场景参数。

Method: 使用神经隐式场表示几何和反射率，结合阴影感知的体积渲染。通过空间网络预测有符号距离和反射率潜在码，反射率网络估计反射率值。

Result: 在形状和光照估计精度上优于现有方法，适用于视角未对齐的多光源图像，并能处理复杂几何和反射率的物体。

Conclusion: 该方法在无需中间线索的情况下，实现了高效的场景参数联合优化。

Abstract: We propose a neural inverse rendering approach that jointly reconstructs
geometry, spatially varying reflectance, and lighting conditions from
multi-view images captured under varying directional lighting. Unlike prior
multi-view photometric stereo methods that require light calibration or
intermediate cues such as per-view normal maps, our method jointly optimizes
all scene parameters from raw images in a single stage. We represent both
geometry and reflectance as neural implicit fields and apply shadow-aware
volume rendering. A spatial network first predicts the signed distance and a
reflectance latent code for each scene point. A reflectance network then
estimates reflectance values conditioned on the latent code and angularly
encoded surface normal, view, and light directions. The proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art normal-guided approaches in shape and lighting
estimation accuracy, generalizes to view-unaligned multi-light images, and
handles objects with challenging geometry and reflectance.

*Jongwook Si,Sungyoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合Corner Loss和R-CBAM模块的图像去雨网络，显著提升了去雨效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单图像去雨不仅需要抑制噪声，还需保留细节和视觉质量。

Method: 引入Corner Loss防止边界和纹理信息丢失，使用R-CBAM模块动态调整特征重要性。

Result: 在Rain100L和Rain100H数据集上分别达到33.29 dB和26.16 dB的PSNR。

Conclusion: 该方法在去雨任务中显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: The problem of single-image rain streak removal goes beyond simple noise
suppression, requiring the simultaneous preservation of fine structural details
and overall visual quality. In this study, we propose a novel image restoration
network that effectively constrains the restoration process by introducing a
Corner Loss, which prevents the loss of object boundaries and detailed texture
information during restoration. Furthermore, we propose a Residual
Convolutional Block Attention Module (R-CBAM) Block into the encoder and
decoder to dynamically adjust the importance of features in both spatial and
channel dimensions, enabling the network to focus more effectively on regions
heavily affected by rain streaks. Quantitative evaluations conducted on the
Rain100L and Rain100H datasets demonstrate that the proposed method
significantly outperforms previous approaches, achieving a PSNR of 33.29 dB on
Rain100L and 26.16 dB on Rain100H.

*Shiyao Yu,Zi-An Wang,Kangning Yin,Zheng Tian,Mingyuan Zhang,Weixin Si,Shihao Zou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态运动检索框架，通过细粒度联合嵌入空间对齐文本、音频、视频和运动，提升检索性能和用户体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏直观的用户交互模式，且未充分利用模态的序列表示。

Method: 采用序列级对比学习，首次引入音频模态，构建四模态联合嵌入空间。

Result: 在多个子任务中表现优于现有方法，如文本到运动检索R@10提升10.16%，视频到运动检索R@1提升25.43%。

Conclusion: 四模态框架显著优于三模态版本，展示了多模态运动检索在运动获取中的潜力。

Abstract: Motion retrieval is crucial for motion acquisition, offering superior
precision, realism, controllability, and editability compared to motion
generation. Existing approaches leverage contrastive learning to construct a
unified embedding space for motion retrieval from text or visual modality.
However, these methods lack a more intuitive and user-friendly interaction mode
and often overlook the sequential representation of most modalities for
improved retrieval performance. To address these limitations, we propose a
framework that aligns four modalities -- text, audio, video, and motion --
within a fine-grained joint embedding space, incorporating audio for the first
time in motion retrieval to enhance user immersion and convenience. This
fine-grained space is achieved through a sequence-level contrastive learning
approach, which captures critical details across modalities for better
alignment. To evaluate our framework, we augment existing text-motion datasets
with synthetic but diverse audio recordings, creating two multi-modal motion
retrieval datasets. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods across multiple sub-tasks, including an 10.16%
improvement in R@10 for text-to-motion retrieval and a 25.43% improvement in
R@1 for video-to-motion retrieval on the HumanML3D dataset. Furthermore, our
results show that our 4-modal framework significantly outperforms its 3-modal
counterpart, underscoring the potential of multi-modal motion retrieval for
advancing motion acquisition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有卫星图像基准数据集在洪水区域分割任务上存在不足，因此需要构建一个专门的数据集。

Method: 从2019年美国中西部洪水事件中收集卫星图像，构建包含10个地点、每个地点10张图像的数据集，并进行统一处理。使用最先进的模型进行语义分割评估，并研究窗口大小的影响。

Result: 模型表现一般，表明未来需要多模态和时序学习策略。

Conclusion: 该数据集将公开，为洪水区域分割研究提供资源，并指出未来改进方向。

Abstract: This study introduces a novel dataset for segmenting flooded areas in
satellite images. After reviewing 77 existing benchmarks utilizing satellite
imagery, we identified a shortage of suitable datasets for this specific task.
To fill this gap, we collected satellite imagery of the 2019 Midwestern USA
floods from Planet Explorer by Planet Labs (Image \c{opyright} 2024 Planet Labs
PBC). The dataset consists of 10 satellite images per location, each containing
both flooded and non-flooded areas. We selected ten locations from each of the
five states: Iowa, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, and South Dakota. The dataset
ensures uniform resolution and resizing during data processing. For evaluating
semantic segmentation performance, we tested state-of-the-art models in
computer vision and remote sensing on our dataset. Additionally, we conducted
an ablation study varying window sizes to capture temporal characteristics.
Overall, the models demonstrated modest results, suggesting a requirement for
future multimodal and temporal learning strategies. The dataset will be
publicly available on

*Chengwei Xia,Fan Ma,Ruijie Quan,Kun Zhan,Yi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散模型的对抗攻击方法（AGD），通过引导噪声注入欺骗多模态大语言模型（MLLMs），同时保持图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对抗攻击多依赖高频扰动，易被防御方法过滤。AGD旨在通过全频谱噪声注入提升攻击效果和鲁棒性。

Method: AGD在反向扩散过程中注入目标语义的噪声，形成对抗图像。噪声覆盖全频谱，避免被低通滤波等防御方法轻易抑制。

Result: 实验表明AGD在攻击效果和对防御的鲁棒性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AGD通过噪声注入策略实现了高效且鲁棒的对抗攻击，为多模态模型的对抗防御提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of generating adversarial image using a
diffusion model to deceive multimodal large language models (MLLMs) into
generating the targeted responses, while avoiding significant distortion of the
clean image. To address the above challenges, we propose an adversarial-guided
diffusion (AGD) approach for adversarial attack MLLMs. We introduce
adversarial-guided noise to ensure attack efficacy. A key observation in our
design is that, unlike most traditional adversarial attacks which embed
high-frequency perturbations directly into the clean image, AGD injects target
semantics into the noise component of the reverse diffusion. Since the added
noise in a diffusion model spans the entire frequency spectrum, the adversarial
signal embedded within it also inherits this full-spectrum property.
Importantly, during reverse diffusion, the adversarial image is formed as a
linear combination of the clean image and the noise. Thus, when applying
defenses such as a simple low-pass filtering, which act independently on each
component, the adversarial image within the noise component is less likely to
be suppressed, as it is not confined to the high-frequency band. This makes AGD
inherently robust to variety defenses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our AGD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in attack performance as well as
in model robustness to some defenses.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合分类和分割的方法，用于改善食品晶体团聚现象的检测，并通过后处理模块保留晶体特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 食品晶体团聚现象影响产品质量，但手动标注在2D显微图像中困难。

Method: 提出监督基线模型生成分割伪标签，训练实例分类模型，结合分类和分割优势，并设计后处理模块。

Result: 提高了团聚分类准确性和尺寸分布预测，成功分类潜在团聚实例。

Conclusion: 方法在两种置信水平下表现良好，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Food crystal agglomeration is a phenomenon occurs during crystallization
which traps water between crystals and affects food product quality. Manual
annotation of agglomeration in 2D microscopic images is particularly difficult
due to the transparency of water bonding and the limited perspective focusing
on a single slide of the imaged sample. To address this challenge, we first
propose a supervised baseline model to generate segmentation pseudo-labels for
the coarsely labeled classification dataset. Next, an instance classification
model that simultaneously performs pixel-wise segmentation is trained. Both
models are used in the inference stage to combine their respective strengths in
classification and segmentation. To preserve crystal properties, a post
processing module is designed and included to both steps. Our method improves
true positive agglomeration classification accuracy and size distribution
predictions compared to other existing methods. Given the variability in
confidence levels of manual annotations, our proposed method is evaluated under
two confidence levels and successfully classifies potential agglomerated
instances.

Motivation: 尽管AI生成的说话头部（AGTHs）在数字人媒体中逐渐兴起，但其质量和现有研究的不足仍存在挑战。

Method: 通过THQA-10K数据集，主观评估AGTHs的质量和失真类别，并提出一种基于第一帧、Y-T切片和音唇一致性的客观评估方法。

Result: 实验结果表明，提出的客观评估方法在AGTH质量评估中达到了SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了AGTH质量评估的空白，并提供了有效的评估工具。

Abstract: Speech-driven methods for portraits are figuratively known as "Talkers"
because of their capability to synthesize speaking mouth shapes and facial
movements. Especially with the rapid development of the Text-to-Image (T2I)
models, AI-Generated Talking Heads (AGTHs) have gradually become an emerging
digital human media. However, challenges persist regarding the quality of these
talkers and AGTHs they generate, and comprehensive studies addressing these
issues remain limited. To address this gap, this paper presents the largest
AGTH quality assessment dataset THQA-10K to date, which selects 12 prominent
T2I models and 14 advanced talkers to generate AGTHs for 14 prompts. After
excluding instances where AGTH generation is unsuccessful, the THQA-10K dataset
contains 10,457 AGTHs. Then, volunteers are recruited to subjectively rate the
AGTHs and give the corresponding distortion categories. In our analysis for
subjective experimental results, we evaluate the performance of talkers in
terms of generalizability and quality, and also expose the distortions of
existing AGTHs. Finally, an objective quality assessment method based on the
first frame, Y-T slice and tone-lip consistency is proposed. Experimental
results show that this method can achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance
in AGTH quality assessment. The work is released at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种轻量级高精度模型YOLO-ROC，通过双向多尺度空间金字塔池化模块（BMS-SPPF）和分层通道压缩策略，解决了现有道路损伤检测方法在多尺度特征提取和计算效率上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 道路损伤检测对交通安全和基础设施维护至关重要，但现有深度学习方法在多尺度特征提取和计算效率上存在不足，导致小目标检测效果差且难以实时部署。

Method: 设计了BMS-SPPF模块以增强多尺度特征提取，并采用分层通道压缩策略降低计算复杂度。BMS-SPPF结合双向空间-通道注意力机制提升小目标检测能力。

Result: 在RDD2022_China_Drone数据集上，YOLO-ROC的mAP50达到67.6%，比基线YOLOv8n提升2.11%，小目标D40类别的mAP50提升16.8%，模型大小仅2.0 MB。

Conclusion: YOLO-ROC在精度和效率上均优于现有方法，具有优秀的泛化能力，适用于实际道路损伤检测应用。

Abstract: Road damage detection is a critical task for ensuring traffic safety and
maintaining infrastructure integrity. While deep learning-based detection
methods are now widely adopted, they still face two core challenges: first, the
inadequate multi-scale feature extraction capabilities of existing networks for
diverse targets like cracks and potholes, leading to high miss rates for
small-scale damage; and second, the substantial parameter counts and
computational demands of mainstream models, which hinder their deployment for
efficient, real-time detection in practical applications. To address these
issues, this paper proposes a high-precision and lightweight model, YOLO - Road
Orthogonal Compact (YOLO-ROC). We designed a Bidirectional Multi-scale Spatial
Pyramid Pooling Fast (BMS-SPPF) module to enhance multi-scale feature
extraction and implemented a hierarchical channel compression strategy to
reduce computational complexity. The BMS-SPPF module leverages a bidirectional
spatial-channel attention mechanism to improve the detection of small targets.
Concurrently, the channel compression strategy reduces the parameter count from
3.01M to 0.89M and GFLOPs from 8.1 to 2.6. Experiments on the
RDD2022_China_Drone dataset demonstrate that YOLO-ROC achieves a mAP50 of
67.6%, surpassing the baseline YOLOv8n by 2.11%. Notably, the mAP50 for the
small-target D40 category improved by 16.8%, and the final model size is only
2.0 MB. Furthermore, the model exhibits excellent generalization performance on
the RDD2022_China_Motorbike dataset.

Abstract: As augmented reality (AR) becomes increasingly integrated into everyday life,
ensuring the safety and trustworthiness of its virtual content is critical. Our
research addresses the risks of task-detrimental AR content, particularly that
which obstructs critical information or subtly manipulates user perception. We
developed two systems, ViDDAR and VIM-Sense, to detect such attacks using
vision-language models (VLMs) and multimodal reasoning modules. Building on
this foundation, we propose three future directions: automated, perceptually
aligned quality assessment of virtual content; detection of multimodal attacks;
and adaptation of VLMs for efficient and user-centered deployment on AR
devices. Overall, our work aims to establish a scalable, human-aligned
framework for safeguarding AR experiences and seeks feedback on perceptual
modeling, multimodal AR content implementation, and lightweight model
adaptation.

TL;DR: 论文提出广义半监督少样本类增量学习（GSemi-FSCIL），通过引入基类和所有已见过的新类作为未标记数据，更贴近实际场景。为解决现有方法难以区分基类和新类的问题，提出了ALDC策略，动态校准特征分布，实验证明其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有半监督少样本类增量学习（Semi-FSCIL）假设未标记数据仅来自当前会话的新类，与实际场景不符。为更贴近现实，论文重新定义问题为GSemi-FSCIL。

Method: 提出ALDC策略，动态利用基类样本校准少样本新类的特征分布。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上，ALDC优于现有方法，达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: GSemi-FSCIL更贴近实际，ALDC有效解决了基类和新类未标记样本的区分问题。

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) focuses on models learning new
concepts from limited data while retaining knowledge of previous classes.
Recently, many studies have started to leverage unlabeled samples to assist
models in learning from few-shot samples, giving rise to the field of
Semi-supervised Few-shot Class-Incremental Learning (Semi-FSCIL). However,
these studies often assume that the source of unlabeled data is only confined
to novel classes of the current session, which presents a narrow perspective
and cannot align well with practical scenarios. To better reflect real-world
scenarios, we redefine Semi-FSCIL as Generalized Semi-FSCIL (GSemi-FSCIL) by
incorporating both base and all the ever-seen novel classes in the unlabeled
set. This change in the composition of unlabeled samples poses a new challenge
for existing methods, as they struggle to distinguish between unlabeled samples
from base and novel classes. To address this issue, we propose an
Ambiguity-guided Learnable Distribution Calibration (ALDC) strategy. ALDC
dynamically uses abundant base samples to correct biased feature distributions
for few-shot novel classes. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that
our method outperforms existing works, setting new state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: RL-QR为RAG系统提供了一种可扩展且无需标注的查询优化方案，但在语义检索方面仍需改进。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems rely heavily on effective query
formulation to unlock external knowledge, yet optimizing queries for diverse,
unstructured real-world documents remains a challenge. We introduce
\textbf{RL-QR}, a reinforcement learning framework for retriever-specific query
rewriting that eliminates the need for human-annotated datasets and extends
applicability to both text-only and multi-modal databases. By synthesizing
scenario-question pairs and leveraging Generalized Reward Policy Optimization
(GRPO), RL-QR trains query rewriters tailored to specific retrievers, enhancing
retrieval performance across varied domains. Experiments on industrial in-house
data demonstrate significant improvements, with
$\text{RL-QR}_{\text{multi-modal}}$ achieving an 11\% relative gain in NDCG@3
for multi-modal RAG and $\text{RL-QR}_{\text{lexical}}$ yielding a 9\% gain for
lexical retrievers. However, challenges persist with semantic and hybrid
retrievers, where rewriters failed to improve performance, likely due to
training misalignments. Our findings highlight RL-QR's potential to
revolutionize query optimization for RAG systems, offering a scalable,
annotation-free solution for real-world retrieval tasks, while identifying
avenues for further refinement in semantic retrieval contexts.

Abstract: Cranial nerves (CNs) play a crucial role in various essential functions of
the human brain, and mapping their pathways from diffusion MRI (dMRI) provides
valuable preoperative insights into the spatial relationships between
individual CNs and key tissues. However, mapping a comprehensive and detailed
CN atlas is challenging because of the unique anatomical structures of each CN
pair and the complexity of the skull base environment.In this work, we present
what we believe to be the first study to develop a comprehensive diffusion
tractography atlas for automated mapping of CN pathways in the human brain. The
CN atlas is generated by fiber clustering by using the streamlines generated by
multi-parametric fiber tractography for each pair of CNs. Instead of disposable
clustering, we explore a new strategy of multi-stage fiber clustering for
multiple analysis of approximately 1,000,000 streamlines generated from the 50
subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Quantitative and visual
experiments demonstrate that our CN atlas achieves high spatial correspondence
with expert manual annotations on multiple acquisition sites, including the HCP
dataset, the Multi-shell Diffusion MRI (MDM) dataset and two clinical cases of
pituitary adenoma patients. The proposed CN atlas can automatically identify 8
fiber bundles associated with 5 pairs of CNs, including the optic nerve CN II,
oculomotor nerve CN III, trigeminal nerve CN V and facial-vestibulocochlear
nerve CN VII/VIII, and its robustness is demonstrated experimentally. This work
contributes to the field of diffusion imaging by facilitating more efficient
and automated mapping the pathways of multiple pairs of CNs, thereby enhancing
the analysis and understanding of complex brain structures through
visualization of their spatial relationships with nearby anatomy.

Abstract: Generic object tracking remains an important yet challenging task in computer
vision due to complex spatio-temporal dynamics, especially in the presence of
occlusions, similar distractors, and appearance variations. Over the past two
decades, a wide range of tracking paradigms, including Siamese-based trackers,
discriminative trackers, and, more recently, prominent transformer-based
approaches, have been introduced to address these challenges. While a few
existing survey papers in this field have either concentrated on a single
category or widely covered multiple ones to capture progress, our paper
presents a comprehensive review of all three categories, with particular
emphasis on the rapidly evolving transformer-based methods. We analyze the core
design principles, innovations, and limitations of each approach through both
qualitative and quantitative comparisons. Our study introduces a novel
categorization and offers a unified visual and tabular comparison of
representative methods. Additionally, we organize existing trackers from
multiple perspectives and summarize the major evaluation benchmarks,
highlighting the fast-paced advancements in transformer-based tracking driven
by their robust spatio-temporal modeling capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的时间序列评估指标TGSI和训练损失函数SATL，以更好地捕捉时间序列的几何结构，提升预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数值指标（如MSE）无法评估时间序列的几何结构，而几何结构对理解时间动态至关重要。

Method: 提出TGSI指标将时间序列转化为图像以评估几何结构，并设计SATL损失函数（包含一阶差分损失、频域损失和感知特征损失）来优化训练。

Result: 实验表明，使用SATL训练的模型在MSE和TGSI指标上均优于基线方法，且推理时无额外计算成本。

Conclusion: TGSI和SATL有效提升了时间序列预测的几何结构建模能力。

Abstract: Time Series forecasting is critical in diverse domains such as weather
forecasting, financial investment, and traffic management. While traditional
numerical metrics like mean squared error (MSE) can quantify point-wise
accuracy, they fail to evaluate the geometric structure of time series data,
which is essential to understand temporal dynamics. To address this issue, we
propose the time series Geometric Structure Index (TGSI), a novel evaluation
metric that transforms time series into images to leverage their inherent
two-dimensional geometric representations. However, since the image
transformation process is non-differentiable, TGSI cannot be directly
integrated as a training loss. We further introduce the Shape-Aware Temporal
Loss (SATL), a multi-component loss function operating in the time series
modality to bridge this gap and enhance structure modeling during training.
SATL combines three components: a first-order difference loss that measures
structural consistency through the MSE between first-order differences, a
frequency domain loss that captures essential periodic patterns using the Fast
Fourier Transform while minimizing noise, and a perceptual feature loss that
measures geometric structure difference in time-series by aligning temporal
features with geometric structure features through a pre-trained temporal
feature extractor and time-series image autoencoder. Experiments across
multiple datasets demonstrate that models trained with SATL achieve superior
performance in both MSE and the proposed TGSI metrics compared to baseline
methods, without additional computational cost during inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法使用预设阈值生成伪标签，忽略了不同类别的分数分布差异，导致伪标签不准确，影响模型性能。

Method: 提出SATL算法，动态计算每类正负样本的分数分布并学习类别特定阈值，同时引入差分排序损失以增强阈值区分能力。

Result: 在Microsoft COCO和VG-200等大规模多标签数据集上的实验表明，该方法在标签有限的情况下显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: SATL算法通过动态学习类别特定阈值和差分排序损失，有效解决了部分标签问题，提升了多标签图像识别的性能。

Abstract: Multi-label image recognition with partial labels (MLR-PL) is designed to
train models using a mix of known and unknown labels. Traditional methods rely
on semantic or feature correlations to create pseudo-labels for unidentified
labels using pre-set thresholds. This approach often overlooks the varying
score distributions across categories, resulting in inaccurate and incomplete
pseudo-labels, thereby affecting performance. In our study, we introduce the
Semantic-Aware Threshold Learning (SATL) algorithm. This innovative approach
calculates the score distribution for both positive and negative samples within
each category and determines category-specific thresholds based on these
distributions. These distributions and thresholds are dynamically updated
throughout the learning process. Additionally, we implement a differential
ranking loss to establish a significant gap between the score distributions of
positive and negative samples, enhancing the discrimination of the thresholds.
Comprehensive experiments and analysis on large-scale multi-label datasets,
such as Microsoft COCO and VG-200, demonstrate that our method significantly
improves performance in scenarios with limited labels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前扩散变换器的成功依赖于预训练VAE的潜在空间，但两阶段训练会引入误差和解码伪影。现有方法转向像素空间但导致复杂流程和增加的计算负担。

Method: 提出PixelNerd框架，利用神经场表示直接建模解码，无需复杂级联或VAE。

Result: 在ImageNet 256×256和512×512上分别达到2.15和2.84 FID，在文本生成图像任务中也表现优异。

Conclusion: PixelNerd提供了一种高效且性能优越的替代方案，避免了传统方法的复杂性。

Abstract: The current success of diffusion transformers heavily depends on the
compressed latent space shaped by the pre-trained variational autoencoder(VAE).
However, this two-stage training paradigm inevitably introduces accumulated
errors and decoding artifacts. To address the aforementioned problems,
researchers return to pixel space at the cost of complicated cascade pipelines
and increased token complexity. In contrast to their efforts, we propose to
model the patch-wise decoding with neural field and present a single-scale,
single-stage, efficient, end-to-end solution, coined as pixel neural field
diffusion~(PixelNerd). Thanks to the efficient neural field representation in
PixNerd, we directly achieved 2.15 FID on ImageNet $256\times256$ and 2.84 FID
on ImageNet $512\times512$ without any complex cascade pipeline or VAE. We also
extend our PixNerd framework to text-to-image applications. Our PixNerd-XXL/16
achieved a competitive 0.73 overall score on the GenEval benchmark and 80.9
overall score on the DPG benchmark.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了如何利用Segment Anything Model 2（SAM2）在低成本、最小输入条件下实现乳腺MRI的3D肿瘤分割，发现中心向外传播策略效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺MRI的3D扫描手动分析耗时且主观，商业AI工具在低收入国家因成本高、软件专有和基础设施需求而难以普及。

Method: 使用单个边界框标注，通过三种切片追踪策略（从上到下、从下到上、中心向外）在3D体积中传播分割预测。

Result: 中心向外传播策略表现最一致且准确，SAM2在零样本条件下表现出色。

Conclusion: 通用基础模型如SAM2可在最小监督下支持3D医学图像分析，为资源有限环境提供可行方案。

Abstract: Breast MRI provides high-resolution volumetric imaging critical for tumor
assessment and treatment planning, yet manual interpretation of 3D scans
remains labor-intensive and subjective. While AI-powered tools hold promise for
accelerating medical image analysis, adoption of commercial medical AI products
remains limited in low- and middle-income countries due to high license costs,
proprietary software, and infrastructure demands. In this work, we investigate
whether the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) can be adapted for low-cost,
minimal-input 3D tumor segmentation in breast MRI. Using a single bounding box
annotation on one slice, we propagate segmentation predictions across the 3D
volume using three different slice-wise tracking strategies: top-to-bottom,
bottom-to-top, and center-outward. We evaluate these strategies across a large
cohort of patients and find that center-outward propagation yields the most
consistent and accurate segmentations. Despite being a zero-shot model not
trained for volumetric medical data, SAM2 achieves strong segmentation
performance under minimal supervision. We further analyze how segmentation
performance relates to tumor size, location, and shape, identifying key failure
modes. Our results suggest that general-purpose foundation models such as SAM2
can support 3D medical image analysis with minimal supervision, offering an
accessible and affordable alternative for resource-constrained settings.

*Gyeongjin Kang,Seungtae Nam,Xiangyu Sun,Sameh Khamis,Abdelrahman Mohamed,Eunbyung Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: iLRM是一种迭代式大型3D重建模型，通过解耦场景表示、分解多视图交互和注入高分辨率信息，实现了高效且高质量的3D重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Transformer的方法因计算成本高而难以扩展，iLRM旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用迭代细化机制，结合解耦场景表示、两阶段注意力方案和高分辨率信息注入。

Result: 在RE10K和DL3DV数据集上，iLRM在重建质量和速度上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: iLRM展示了卓越的扩展性，能在较低计算成本下实现更高质量的3D重建。

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D modeling has emerged as a promising approach for rapid and
high-quality 3D reconstruction. In particular, directly generating explicit 3D
representations, such as 3D Gaussian splatting, has attracted significant
attention due to its fast and high-quality rendering, as well as numerous
applications. However, many state-of-the-art methods, primarily based on
transformer architectures, suffer from severe scalability issues because they
rely on full attention across image tokens from multiple input views, resulting
in prohibitive computational costs as the number of views or image resolution
increases. Toward a scalable and efficient feed-forward 3D reconstruction, we
introduce an iterative Large 3D Reconstruction Model (iLRM) that generates 3D
Gaussian representations through an iterative refinement mechanism, guided by
three core principles: (1) decoupling the scene representation from input-view
images to enable compact 3D representations; (2) decomposing fully-attentional
multi-view interactions into a two-stage attention scheme to reduce
computational costs; and (3) injecting high-resolution information at every
layer to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction. Experimental results on widely
used datasets, such as RE10K and DL3DV, demonstrate that iLRM outperforms
existing methods in both reconstruction quality and speed. Notably, iLRM
exhibits superior scalability, delivering significantly higher reconstruction
quality under comparable computational cost by efficiently leveraging a larger
number of input views.

TL;DR: UniLIP扩展了CLIP的功能，支持重建、生成和编辑任务，通过两阶段训练和自蒸馏策略保持原始理解性能，同时在生成和编辑任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有CLIP统一方法在重建和生成任务中需要额外解码器或量化的问题，同时保持原始理解性能。

Method: 提出两阶段训练方案和自蒸馏策略，以及双条件架构连接MLLM和扩散变换器。

Result: 在文本到图像生成和图像编辑任务中，UniLIP在多个基准测试中超越现有统一模型。

Conclusion: UniLIP成功扩展了CLIP的应用范围，使其在理解和生成任务中均表现优异。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose UniLIP, which extends CLIP to reconstruction,
generation and editing, thereby building a unified tokenizer upon its
exceptional comprehension capabilities. Previous CLIP-based unified methods
often require additional diffusion decoders or quantization to support
reconstruction and generation tasks, leading to inconsistent reconstruction or
degradation of original comprehension performance.In contrast, we introduce a
two-stage training scheme and a self-distillation strategy that progressively
integrates reconstruction capabilities into CLIP, allowing it to maintain
original comprehension performance while achieving effective image
reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose a dual-condition architecture to
connect the MLLM and diffusion transformer, using both learnable queries and
the last layer multimodal hidden states as joint conditions. This method not
only enables the utilization of the MLLM's strong reasoning capabilities in
generation tasks, but also maximizes the exploitation of the rich information
in UniLIP features during editing tasks. In text-to-image generation tasks,
UniLIP obtains scores of 0.87 and 0.53 on GenEval and WISE benchmark
respectively, surpassing all previous unified models of similar scale. In image
editing, UniLIP also achieves a score of 3.62 on the ImgEdit Benchmark,
surpassing recent state-of-the-art models such as BAGEL and UniWorld-V1. UniLIP
effectively expand the application scope of CLIP, enabling continuous CLIP
features to not only serve as the optimal choice for understanding tasks but
also achieve highly competitive performance in generation and editing tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BLiM框架通过双向似然估计和候选先验归一化（CPN）解决文本-视频检索中的候选先验偏差问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的应用中存在候选先验偏差，导致检索结果偏向高先验而非相关候选。

Method: 提出BLiM框架，结合双向似然估计和CPN模块，训练模型生成文本和视频特征，并校准候选先验偏差。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，BLiM+CPN平均提升6.4 R@1，有效缓解偏差并增强查询-候选相关性。

Conclusion: BLiM和CPN不仅提升检索性能，还在多模态任务中具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Text-Video Retrieval aims to find the most relevant text (or video) candidate
given a video (or text) query from large-scale online databases. Recent work
leverages multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to improve retrieval,
especially for long or complex query-candidate pairs. However, we observe that
the naive application of MLLMs, i.e., retrieval based on candidate likelihood,
introduces candidate prior bias, favoring candidates with inherently higher
priors over those more relevant to the query. To this end, we propose a novel
retrieval framework, Bidirectional Likelihood Estimation with MLLM (BLiM),
which leverages both query and candidate likelihoods by training the model to
generate text from a given video as well as video features from a given text.
Furthermore, we introduce Candidate Prior Normalization (CPN), a simple yet
effective training-free score calibration module designed to mitigate candidate
prior bias in candidate likelihood. On four Text-Video Retrieval benchmarks,
our BLiM equipped with CPN outperforms previous state-of-the-art models by 6.4
R@1 on average, effectively alleviating candidate prior bias and emphasizing
query-candidate relevance. Our in-depth analysis across various multi-modal
tasks beyond retrieval highlights the broad applicability of CPN which enhances
visual understanding by reducing reliance on textual priors. Code is available

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LED的新基准，用于评估文档布局预测的结构鲁棒性，解决了传统指标（如IoU和mAP）无法检测的结构性错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管文档布局分析在大型语言模型和多模态模型的推动下取得了进展，但仍存在区域合并、分割和内容缺失等结构性错误，传统评估指标无法有效检测这些问题。

Method: 提出了Layout Error Detection (LED)基准，定义了八种标准化错误类型，并设计了三个互补任务：错误存在检测、错误类型分类和元素级错误类型分类。同时构建了LED-Dataset，通过注入基于DLA模型经验分布的真实结构性错误生成合成数据集。

Result: 实验结果表明，LED能有效区分结构理解能力，揭示了传统指标无法显示的模态偏见和性能权衡。

Conclusion: LED为文档布局预测的结构鲁棒性评估提供了新工具，弥补了传统指标的不足。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Document Layout Analysis through Large Language Models
and Multimodal Models have significantly improved layout detection. However,
despite these improvements, challenges remain in addressing critical structural
errors, such as region merging, splitting, and missing content. Conventional
evaluation metrics like IoU and mAP, which focus primarily on spatial overlap,
are insufficient for detecting these errors. To address this limitation, we
propose Layout Error Detection (LED), a novel benchmark designed to evaluate
the structural robustness of document layout predictions. LED defines eight
standardized error types, and formulates three complementary tasks: error
existence detection, error type classification, and element-wise error type
classification. Furthermore, we construct LED-Dataset, a synthetic dataset
generated by injecting realistic structural errors based on empirical
distributions from DLA models. Experimental results across a range of LMMs
reveal that LED effectively differentiates structural understanding
capabilities, exposing modality biases and performance trade-offs not visible
through traditional metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有扩散方法在复杂或大范围变换时难以保持场景一致性的问题。

Method: 采用解耦流程，结合训练无关的扩散方法FreeFine进行修复和细化。

Result: 在GeoBench基准测试中，FreeFine在图像保真度和编辑精度上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FreeFine为复杂几何编辑提供了一种高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: We tackle the task of geometric image editing, where an object within an
image is repositioned, reoriented, or reshaped while preserving overall scene
coherence. Previous diffusion-based editing methods often attempt to handle all
relevant subtasks in a single step, proving difficult when transformations
become large or structurally complex. We address this by proposing a decoupled
pipeline that separates object transformation, source region inpainting, and
target region refinement. Both inpainting and refinement are implemented using
a training-free diffusion approach, FreeFine. In experiments on our new
GeoBench benchmark, which contains both 2D and 3D editing scenarios, FreeFine
outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives in image fidelity, and edit
precision, especially under demanding transformations. Code and benchmark are

TL;DR: ST-SAM是一种高效的半监督伪装目标检测框架，通过动态筛选和扩展高置信度伪标签，结合Segment Anything Model，显著减少标注需求并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有半监督伪装目标检测方法依赖多网络架构，存在预测偏差和计算开销大的问题。

Method: ST-SAM采用自训练策略，动态过滤伪标签并转化为混合提示，结合Segment Anything Model。

Result: 在仅1%标注数据下，ST-SAM性能优于现有方法，甚至媲美全监督方法。

Conclusion: ST-SAM为高效标注的半监督伪装目标检测提供了新范式。

Abstract: Semi-supervised Camouflaged Object Detection (SSCOD) aims to reduce reliance
on costly pixel-level annotations by leveraging limited annotated data and
abundant unlabeled data. However, existing SSCOD methods based on
Teacher-Student frameworks suffer from severe prediction bias and error
propagation under scarce supervision, while their multi-network architectures
incur high computational overhead and limited scalability. To overcome these
limitations, we propose ST-SAM, a highly annotation-efficient yet concise
framework that breaks away from conventional SSCOD constraints. Specifically,
ST-SAM employs Self-Training strategy that dynamically filters and expands
high-confidence pseudo-labels to enhance a single-model architecture, thereby
fundamentally circumventing inter-model prediction bias. Furthermore, by
transforming pseudo-labels into hybrid prompts containing domain-specific
knowledge, ST-SAM effectively harnesses the Segment Anything Model's potential
for specialized tasks to mitigate error accumulation in self-training.
Experiments on COD benchmark datasets demonstrate that ST-SAM achieves
state-of-the-art performance with only 1\% labeled data, outperforming existing
SSCOD methods and even matching fully supervised methods. Remarkably, ST-SAM
requires training only a single network, without relying on specific models or
loss functions. This work establishes a new paradigm for annotation-efficient
SSCOD. Codes will be available at https://github.com/hu-xh/ST-SAM.

Method: 提出PriorFusion框架，结合实例感知注意力机制、数据驱动的形状模板空间和扩散模型，生成准确预测。

Result: 在大规模数据集上验证，方法显著提升感知准确性，尤其在挑战性条件下表现优异。

Conclusion: PriorFusion通过整合多类先验，生成更准确、规则且连贯的道路元素预测。

Abstract: With the growing interest in autonomous driving, there is an increasing
demand for accurate and reliable road perception technologies. In complex
environments without high-definition map support, autonomous vehicles must
independently interpret their surroundings to ensure safe and robust
decision-making. However, these scenarios pose significant challenges due to
the large number, complex geometries, and frequent occlusions of road elements.
A key limitation of existing approaches lies in their insufficient exploitation
of the structured priors inherently present in road elements, resulting in
irregular, inaccurate predictions. To address this, we propose PriorFusion, a
unified framework that effectively integrates semantic, geometric, and
generative priors to enhance road element perception. We introduce an
instance-aware attention mechanism guided by shape-prior features, then
construct a data-driven shape template space that encodes low-dimensional
representations of road elements, enabling clustering to generate anchor points
as reference priors. We design a diffusion-based framework that leverages these
prior anchors to generate accurate and complete predictions. Experiments on
large-scale autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that our method
significantly improves perception accuracy, particularly under challenging
conditions. Visualization results further confirm that our approach produces
more accurate, regular, and coherent predictions of road elements.

Motivation: 探索扩散模型如何在没有明确指导的情况下内部表示内容和风格概念。

Result: 发现内容词主要影响对象相关区域，风格词影响背景和纹理区域，表明模型对内容-风格区分有潜在理解。

Conclusion: 扩散模型在无监督情况下能学习复杂艺术概念，为理解生成模型内部表示提供了新视角。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
generating artistic content by learning from billions of images, including
popular artworks. However, the fundamental question of how these models
internally represent concepts, such as content and style in paintings, remains
unexplored. Traditional computer vision assumes content and style are
orthogonal, but diffusion models receive no explicit guidance about this
distinction during training. In this work, we investigate how transformer-based
text-to-image diffusion models encode content and style concepts when
generating artworks. We leverage cross-attention heatmaps to attribute pixels
in generated images to specific prompt tokens, enabling us to isolate image
regions influenced by content-describing versus style-describing tokens. Our
findings reveal that diffusion models demonstrate varying degrees of
content-style separation depending on the specific artistic prompt and style
requested. In many cases, content tokens primarily influence object-related
regions while style tokens affect background and texture areas, suggesting an
emergent understanding of the content-style distinction. These insights
contribute to our understanding of how large-scale generative models internally
represent complex artistic concepts without explicit supervision. We share the
code and dataset, together with an exploratory tool for visualizing attention
maps at https://github.com/umilISLab/artistic-prompt-interpretation.

Abstract: Lightweight convolutional and transformer-based models have become vital for
real-time image classification in resource-constrained applications, such as
embedded systems and edge devices. This work analyzes the influence of
hyperparameter adjustment on the accuracy and convergence behavior of seven
efficient deep learning architectures: EfficientNetV2-S, ConvNeXt-T, MobileViT
v2 (XXS/XS/S), MobileNetV3-L, TinyViT-21M, and RepVGG-A2. All models are
trained on the ImageNet-1K dataset under consistent training settings, with an
emphasis on real-time practicality. An comprehensive ablation study is
undertaken to separate the effect of critical hyperparameters, including
learning rate schedules, batch sizes, input resolution, data augmentation,
regularization approaches, and optimizer choice. To assess appropriateness for
real-time applications, each model is assessed not only in terms of Top-1 and
Top-5 classification accuracy, but also in terms of inference time, parameter
count, model size, and frames-per-second (FPS) on a GPU-accelerated edge
deployment simulation. Results demonstrate that cosine learning rate decay and
adjustable batch size may greatly boost both accuracy and convergence speed,
while keeping low latency and memory cost. Notably, RepVGG-A2 achieves over 80%
Top-1 accuracy with efficient inference performance, offering a compelling
balance between accuracy and deployment cost for VGG-style models. The results
give practical guidance for constructing resource-efficient deep learning
models appropriate for real-time image processing pipelines. All code and

Conclusion: FastDriveVLA通过前景信息优化视觉令牌修剪，显著提升自动驾驶系统的计算效率和决策能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated significant potential
in complex scene understanding and action reasoning, leading to their
increasing adoption in end-to-end autonomous driving systems. However, the long
visual tokens of VLA models greatly increase computational costs. Current
visual token pruning methods in Vision-Language Models (VLM) rely on either
visual token similarity or visual-text attention, but both have shown poor
performance in autonomous driving scenarios. Given that human drivers
concentrate on relevant foreground areas while driving, we assert that
retaining visual tokens containing this foreground information is essential for
effective decision-making. Inspired by this, we propose FastDriveVLA, a novel
reconstruction-based vision token pruning framework designed specifically for
autonomous driving. FastDriveVLA includes a plug-and-play visual token pruner
called ReconPruner, which prioritizes foreground information through MAE-style
pixel reconstruction. A novel adversarial foreground-background reconstruction
strategy is designed to train ReconPruner for the visual encoder of VLA models.
Once trained, ReconPruner can be seamlessly applied to different VLA models
with the same visual encoder without retraining. To train ReconPruner, we also
introduce a large-scale dataset called nuScenes-FG, consisting of 241K
image-mask pairs with annotated foreground regions. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes closed-loop planning benchmark across
different pruning ratios.

Result: 在OpenLane-V2基准测试中，FASTopoWM在车道段检测（37.4% mAP）和中心线感知（46.3% OLS）上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FASTopoWM通过改进时间感知和减少姿态估计依赖，显著提升了车道拓扑推理性能。

Abstract: Lane segment topology reasoning provides comprehensive bird's-eye view (BEV)
road scene understanding, which can serve as a key perception module in
planning-oriented end-to-end autonomous driving systems. Existing lane topology
reasoning methods often fall short in effectively leveraging temporal
information to enhance detection and reasoning performance. Recently,
stream-based temporal propagation method has demonstrated promising results by
incorporating temporal cues at both the query and BEV levels. However, it
remains limited by over-reliance on historical queries, vulnerability to pose
estimation failures, and insufficient temporal propagation. To overcome these
limitations, we propose FASTopoWM, a novel fast-slow lane segment topology
reasoning framework augmented with latent world models. To reduce the impact of
pose estimation failures, this unified framework enables parallel supervision
of both historical and newly initialized queries, facilitating mutual
reinforcement between the fast and slow systems. Furthermore, we introduce
latent query and BEV world models conditioned on the action latent to propagate
the state representations from past observations to the current timestep. This
design substantially improves the performance of temporal perception within the
slow pipeline. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane-V2 benchmark demonstrate
that FASTopoWM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both lane segment
detection (37.4% v.s. 33.6% on mAP) and centerline perception (46.3% v.s. 41.5%
on OLS).

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了医学图像分割中的领域偏移问题，具有广泛的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in clinical workflows, but
domain shift often leads to performance degradation when models are applied to
unseen clinical domains. This challenge arises due to variations in imaging
conditions, scanner types, and acquisition protocols, limiting the practical
deployment of segmentation models. Unlike natural images, medical images
typically exhibit consistent anatomical structures across patients, with
domain-specific variations mainly caused by imaging conditions. This unique
characteristic makes medical image segmentation particularly challenging.
  To address this challenge, we propose a domain generalization framework
tailored for medical image segmentation. Our approach improves robustness to
domain-specific variations by introducing implicit feature perturbations guided
by domain statistics. Specifically, we employ a learnable semantic direction
selector and a covariance-based semantic intensity sampler to modulate
domain-variant features while preserving task-relevant anatomical consistency.
Furthermore, we design an adaptive consistency constraint that is selectively
applied only when feature adjustment leads to degraded segmentation
performance. This constraint encourages the adjusted features to align with the
original predictions, thereby stabilizing feature selection and improving the
reliability of the segmentation.
  Extensive experiments on two public multi-center benchmarks show that our
framework consistently outperforms existing domain generalization approaches,
achieving robust and generalizable segmentation performance across diverse
clinical domains.

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂开放场景中表现出优异的准确性和泛化能力，有效解决了数据不平衡和小目标识别问题。

Abstract: Traffic sign recognition, as a core component of autonomous driving
perception systems, directly influences vehicle environmental awareness and
driving safety. Current technologies face two significant challenges: first,
the traffic sign dataset exhibits a pronounced long-tail distribution,
resulting in a substantial decline in recognition performance of traditional
convolutional networks when processing low-frequency and out-of-distribution
classes; second, traffic signs in real-world scenarios are predominantly small
targets with significant scale variations, making it difficult to extract
multi-scale features.To overcome these issues, we propose a novel two-stage
framework combining open-vocabulary detection and cross-modal learning. For
traffic sign detection, our NanoVerse YOLO model integrates a reparameterizable
vision-language path aggregation network (RepVL-PAN) and an SPD-Conv module to
specifically enhance feature extraction for small, multi-scale targets. For
traffic sign classification, we designed a Traffic Sign Recognition Multimodal
Contrastive Learning model (TSR-MCL). By contrasting visual features from a
Vision Transformer with semantic features from a rule-based BERT, TSR-MCL
learns robust, frequency-independent representations, effectively mitigating
class confusion caused by data imbalance. On the TT100K dataset, our method
achieves a state-of-the-art 78.4% mAP in the long-tail detection task for
all-class recognition. The model also obtains 91.8% accuracy and 88.9% recall,
significantly outperforming mainstream algorithms and demonstrating superior
accuracy and generalization in complex, open-world scenarios.

Method: 采用平面适应的高斯表示进行高效建模，结合分割引导的视频修复去除动态和静态前景物体，并通过语义感知的HSV空间颜色校正增强一致性。

Result: 在城市规模数据集上的实验表明，该方法在视觉一致性和几何保真度上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架在复杂城市环境中实现了高质量的道路表面重建。

Abstract: Road surface reconstruction is essential for autonomous driving, supporting
centimeter-accurate lane perception and high-definition mapping in complex
urban environments.While recent methods based on mesh rendering or 3D Gaussian
splatting (3DGS) achieve promising results under clean and static conditions,
they remain vulnerable to occlusions from dynamic agents, visual clutter from
static obstacles, and appearance degradation caused by lighting and weather
changes. We present a robust reconstruction framework that integrates
occlusion-aware 2D Gaussian surfels with semantic-guided color enhancement to
recover clean, consistent road surfaces. Our method leverages a planar-adapted
Gaussian representation for efficient large-scale modeling, employs
segmentation-guided video inpainting to remove both dynamic and static
foreground objects, and enhances color coherence via semantic-aware correction
in HSV space. Extensive experiments on urban-scale datasets demonstrate that
our framework produces visually coherent and geometrically faithful
reconstructions, significantly outperforming prior methods under real-world
conditions.

*Ahmet Can Ömercikoğlu,Mustafa Mansur Yönügül,Pakize Erdoğmuş*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究了输入分辨率对三种深度学习人脸检测器（YOLOv11、YOLOv12、MTCNN）性能的影响，发现YOLOv11在高分辨率下表现最佳，YOLOv12召回率略高，MTCNN在实时性上较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的低分辨率图像对人脸检测性能有显著影响，需系统评估不同分辨率下的模型表现。

Method: 使用WIDER FACE数据集，在多种分辨率（160x160至640x640）下评估YOLOv11、YOLOv12和MTCNN的精度、召回率、mAP及推理时间。

Result: YOLOv11在高分辨率下检测精度最优，YOLOv12召回率略高，MTCNN在实时性上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 研究结果为根据不同操作约束选择分辨率感知的人脸检测模型提供了实用建议。

Abstract: Face detection is a crucial component in many AI-driven applications such as
surveillance, biometric authentication, and human-computer interaction.
However, real-world conditions like low-resolution imagery present significant
challenges that degrade detection performance. In this study, we systematically
investigate the impact of input resolution on the accuracy and robustness of
three prominent deep learning-based face detectors: YOLOv11, YOLOv12, and
MTCNN. Using the WIDER FACE dataset, we conduct extensive evaluations across
multiple image resolutions (160x160, 320x320, and 640x640) and assess each
model's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95,
and inference time. Results indicate that YOLOv11 outperforms YOLOv12 and MTCNN
in terms of detection accuracy, especially at higher resolutions, while YOLOv12
exhibits slightly better recall. MTCNN, although competitive in landmark
localization, lags in real-time inference speed. Our findings provide
actionable insights for selecting resolution-aware face detection models
suitable for varying operational constraints.

Motivation: 探讨计算机视觉领域的关键设计模式如何演变，以及这些创新如何推动图像识别、生成和自监督学习的发展。

Method: 通过分析六篇代表性论文（ResNet、ViT、GANs、LDMs、DINO、MAE），总结其核心贡献和技术特点。

Result: 展示了从ResNet的残差连接到MAE的自监督预训练，计算机视觉在架构和训练方法上的显著进步。

Conclusion: 计算机视觉领域的设计模式不断演进，从深度网络到注意力机制和自监督学习，推动了图像任务的性能和效率提升。

Abstract: This report analyzes the evolution of key design patterns in computer vision
by examining six influential papers. The analy- sis begins with foundational
architectures for image recognition. We review ResNet, which introduced
residual connections to overcome the vanishing gradient problem and enable
effective training of significantly deeper convolutional networks.
Subsequently, we examine the Vision Transformer (ViT), which established a new
paradigm by applying the Transformer ar- chitecture to sequences of image
patches, demonstrating the efficacy of attention-based models for large-scale
image recogni- tion. Building on these visual representation backbones, we
investigate generative models. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are
analyzed for their novel adversarial training process, which challenges a
generator against a discriminator to learn complex data distributions. Then,
Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are covered, which improve upon prior generative
methods by performing a sequential denoising process in a perceptually
compressed latent space. LDMs achieve high-fidelity synthesis with greater
computational efficiency, representing the current state-of-the-art for image
generation. Finally, we explore self-supervised learning techniques that reduce
dependency on labeled data. DINO is a self-distillation framework in which a
student network learns to match the output of a momentum-updated teacher,
yielding features with strong k-NN classification performance. We conclude with
Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which utilize an asymmetric encoder-decoder design
to reconstruct heavily masked inputs, providing a highly scalable and effective
method for pre-training large-scale vision models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Short-LVLM（SVL）的新框架，通过利用重要的视觉-语言（VL）标记和减轻层间特征差距，解决了大型视觉-语言模型（LVLM）层剪枝的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型视觉-语言模型在多模态理解和推理方面表现出色，但其庞大的参数和高计算成本限制了实际应用。研究旨在探索层剪枝技术在LVLM中的有效性。

Method: 通过实验发现，直接应用自然语言处理（NLP）的层剪枝方法对LVLM无效。因此，提出了Short-LVLM框架，专注于重要VL标记和层间特征差距的优化。

Result: Short-LVLM在性能和效率之间取得了优越的平衡，并具有训练免费、模型无关和高度兼容等潜在优势。

Conclusion: Short-LVLM为LVLM的压缩提供了一种有效的解决方案，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Although large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in multi-modal understanding and reasoning, their practical
applications are still limited by massive model parameters and high
computational costs. Recent efforts from natural language processing (NLP) have
shown the effectiveness of layer pruning, offering a plausible training-free
compression solution. However, due to the modality divergence between vision
and language, it is unclear whether these NLP techniques are still effective in
LVLMs. In this paper, we empirically prove that directly applying these layer
pruning methods to LVLMs is ineffective. Through extensive experiments, we find
that non-essential vision-language (VL) tokens and inter-layer feature gaps
pose critical challenges to pruning layers in LVLMs. Based on these insights,
we propose a novel framework Short-LVLM (SVL) that can utilize important VL
tokens and mitigate the layer-wise feature gaps. Notably, Short-LVLM not only
achieves a superior trade-off between performance and efficiency but also
exhibits several potential advantages, i.e., training-free, model-agnostic, and
highly compatible. The code for this work is publicly available at

Conclusion: VMatcher通过混合Mamba和Transformer，在特征匹配任务中实现了高效且高性能的平衡，适用于实时应用。

Abstract: This paper introduces VMatcher, a hybrid Mamba-Transformer network for
semi-dense feature matching between image pairs. Learning-based feature
matching methods, whether detector-based or detector-free, achieve
state-of-the-art performance but depend heavily on the Transformer's attention
mechanism, which, while effective, incurs high computational costs due to its
quadratic complexity. In contrast, Mamba introduces a Selective State-Space
Model (SSM) that achieves comparable or superior performance with linear
complexity, offering significant efficiency gains. VMatcher leverages a hybrid
approach, integrating Mamba's highly efficient long-sequence processing with
the Transformer's attention mechanism. Multiple VMatcher configurations are
proposed, including hierarchical architectures, demonstrating their
effectiveness in setting new benchmarks efficiently while ensuring robustness
and practicality for real-time applications where rapid inference is crucial.

TL;DR: UniEmo是一个统一框架，将情感理解与生成任务结合，通过层次化情感理解链和多尺度特征提取实现互补增强，生成高质量情感图像。

Motivation: 情感理解与生成任务通常分离，但它们本质互补，可以相互增强。本文旨在通过统一框架解决这一挑战。

Method: 提出层次化情感理解链和可学习专家查询，提取多尺度情感特征；融合查询与情感表征指导扩散模型生成情感图像；引入情感相关系数和条件损失增强生成多样性。

Result: UniEmo在情感理解与生成任务中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过生成驱动的双重反馈机制，UniEmo提升了模型的情感理解能力，实现了任务间的互补增强。

Abstract: Emotional understanding and generation are often treated as separate tasks,
yet they are inherently complementary and can mutually enhance each other. In
this paper, we propose the UniEmo, a unified framework that seamlessly
integrates these two tasks. The key challenge lies in the abstract nature of
emotions, necessitating the extraction of visual representations beneficial for
both tasks. To address this, we propose a hierarchical emotional understanding
chain with learnable expert queries that progressively extracts multi-scale
emotional features, thereby serving as a foundational step for unification.
Simultaneously, we fuse these expert queries and emotional representations to
guide the diffusion model in generating emotion-evoking images. To enhance the
diversity and fidelity of the generated emotional images, we further introduce
the emotional correlation coefficient and emotional condition loss into the
fusion process. This step facilitates fusion and alignment for emotional
generation guided by the understanding. In turn, we demonstrate that joint
training allows the generation component to provide implicit feedback to the
understanding part. Furthermore, we propose a novel data filtering algorithm to
select high-quality and diverse emotional images generated by the well-trained
model, which explicitly feedback into the understanding part. Together, these
generation-driven dual feedback processes enhance the model's understanding
capacity. Extensive experiments show that UniEmo significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both emotional understanding and generation tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种渐进式对齐策略MP^2A，用于改进CLIP在多源无监督域适应中的性能，通过逐步引入高置信度样本减少噪声影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在同时对齐所有伪标签数据时容易受到噪声和难分类样本的影响，导致错误传播和次优特征学习，尤其是在多源场景下。

Method: 提出MP^2A方法，先从高置信度目标样本开始训练，逐步引入更具挑战性的样本，以减少初始噪声的影响。

Result: 在ImageCLEF、Office-Home和DomainNet基准测试中，MP^2A表现优于现有CLIP-based MS-UDA方法。

Conclusion: 渐进式对齐策略有效减少了确认偏差，提升了域不变特征的学习效果，在多源无监督域适应中表现优异。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models like CLIP have become a powerful foundation for
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation due to their strong zero-shot generalization.
State-of-the-art methods typically leverage CLIP to generate pseudo-labels for
the target domain, then fine-tune the model to learn domain-invariant features.
However, these methods attempt to align source and target domains using all
pseudo-labeled data simultaneously. This one-shot alignment struggles with
noisy, hard-to-classify samples, leading to error propagation and suboptimal
feature learning. The problem is even more amplified in the multi-source
scenario, where diverse domain gaps and varying noise levels across multiple
source domains further destabilize the alignment process. To address this
issue, in this work, we propose a progressive alignment strategy for adapting
CLIP to unlabeled downstream task. Our method begins by training the model on a
high-confidence subset of target samples, allowing it to first learn a
well-aligned representation from the most reliable data. As training
progresses, it gradually incorporates more challenging samples, guiding the
model to refine its understanding without being overwhelmed by initial label
noise. This progressive approach effectively mitigates confirmation bias and
promotes a more robust convergence, allowing for the learning of genuinely
domain-invariant features. We name our approach MP^2A and test it on three
popular UDA benchmarks, namely ImageCLEF, Office-Home, and the most challenging
DomainNet. Experiments showcase that MP^2A achieves state-of-the-art
performance when compared with most recent CLIP-based MS-UDA approaches,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

Result: 在基准数据集上表现优于现有方法，达到最优性能。

Conclusion: NeRF和3DGS是互补的，结合二者可为3D场景表示提供高效新方法。

Abstract: We introduce NeRF-GS, a novel framework that jointly optimizes Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). This framework
leverages the inherent continuous spatial representation of NeRF to mitigate
several limitations of 3DGS, including sensitivity to Gaussian initialization,
limited spatial awareness, and weak inter-Gaussian correlations, thereby
enhancing its performance. In NeRF-GS, we revisit the design of 3DGS and
progressively align its spatial features with NeRF, enabling both
representations to be optimized within the same scene through shared 3D spatial
information. We further address the formal distinctions between the two
approaches by optimizing residual vectors for both implicit features and
Gaussian positions to enhance the personalized capabilities of 3DGS.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that NeRF-GS surpasses existing
methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance. This outcome confirms that
NeRF and 3DGS are complementary rather than competing, offering new insights
into hybrid approaches that combine 3DGS and NeRF for efficient 3D scene
representation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学视觉表示学习方法简化临床报告为单一实体或碎片化标记，且对比学习依赖大量负样本，不适用于小规模医学数据集。

Method: AGA框架基于稀疏相似矩阵实现双向分组，设计自适应阈值门控模块动态学习分组阈值，并引入实例感知组对齐损失和双向跨模态分组对齐模块。

Result: 在公开和私有数据集上，AGA在图像-文本检索和分类任务中表现出色，支持微调和零样本设置。

Conclusion: AGA通过结构化语义提取和自适应分组机制，解决了医学视觉表示学习中的关键挑战，性能优越。

Abstract: Learning medical visual representations from paired images and reports is a
promising direction in representation learning. However, current
vision-language pretraining methods in the medical domain often simplify
clinical reports into single entities or fragmented tokens, ignoring their
inherent structure. In addition, contrastive learning frameworks typically
depend on large quantities of hard negative samples, which is impractical for
small-scale medical datasets. To tackle these challenges, we propose Adaptive
Grouped Alignment (AGA), a new framework that captures structured semantics
from paired medical images and reports. AGA introduces a bidirectional grouping
mechanism based on a sparse similarity matrix. For each image-report pair, we
compute fine-grained similarities between text tokens and image patches. Each
token selects its top-matching patches to form a visual group, and each patch
selects its most related tokens to form a language group. To enable adaptive
grouping, we design two threshold gating modules, called Language Grouped
Threshold Gate and Vision Grouped Threshold Gate, which learn grouping
thresholds dynamically. Group representations are computed as weighted averages
based on similarity scores. To align each token with its group representation,
we introduce an Instance Aware Group Alignment loss that operates within each
image-text pair, removing the need for external negatives. Finally, a
Bidirectional Cross-modal Grouped Alignment module is applied to enhance
fine-grained alignment between visual and linguistic group representations.
Extensive experiments on public and private datasets show that our method
achieves strong performance on image-text retrieval and classification tasks
under both fine-tuning and zero-shot settings.

Motivation: 解决现有生成方法在计算成本、可靠性和适应性上的局限性，特别是在医学影像中低发病率病理案例的检测需求。

Method: 利用SBDDM的前向扩散轨迹，通过Stein分数捕捉轨迹曲率，实现无重建的OOD检测。

Result: 在Near-OOD和Far-OOD检测中分别实现了10.43%和18.10%的相对性能提升，计算成本大幅降低。

Conclusion: SBDDM是一种高效、可靠的OOD检测方法，适用于实时计算机辅助诊断。

Abstract: In medical imaging, unsupervised out-of-distribution (OOD) detection offers
an attractive approach for identifying pathological cases with extremely low
incidence rates. In contrast to supervised methods, OOD-based approaches
function without labels and are inherently robust to data imbalances. Current
generative approaches often rely on likelihood estimation or reconstruction
error, but these methods can be computationally expensive, unreliable, and
require retraining if the inlier data changes. These limitations hinder their
ability to distinguish nominal from anomalous inputs efficiently, consistently,
and robustly. We propose a reconstruction-free OOD detection method that
leverages the forward diffusion trajectories of a Stein score-based denoising
diffusion model (SBDDM). By capturing trajectory curvature via the estimated
Stein score, our approach enables accurate anomaly scoring with only five
diffusion steps. A single SBDDM pre-trained on a large, semantically aligned
medical dataset generalizes effectively across multiple Near-OOD and Far-OOD
benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance while drastically reducing
computational cost during inference. Compared to existing methods, SBDDM
achieves a relative improvement of up to 10.43% and 18.10% for Near-OOD and
Far-OOD detection, making it a practical building block for real-time, reliable
computer-aided diagnosis.

Conclusion: 该系统是化学检测方法的有效替代方案。

Abstract: This paper aims to develop a machine learning-based system for automatically
detecting honey adulteration with sugar syrup, based on honey hyperspectral
imaging data. First, the floral source of a honey sample is classified by a
botanical origin identification subsystem. Then, the sugar syrup adulteration
is identified, and its concentration is quantified by an adulteration detection
subsystem. Both subsystems consist of two steps. The first step involves
extracting relevant features from the honey sample using Linear Discriminant
Analysis (LDA). In the second step, we utilize the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
model to classify the honey botanical origin in the first subsystem and
identify the adulteration level in the second subsystem. We assess the proposed
system performance on a public honey hyperspectral image dataset. The result
indicates that the proposed system can detect adulteration in honey with an
overall cross-validation accuracy of 96.39%, making it an appropriate
alternative to the current chemical-based detection methods.

Conclusion: KANs在解耦复杂风格流形中具有重要作用，能更有效地建模非线性特征交互。

Abstract: Art style classification remains a formidable challenge in computational
aesthetics due to the scarcity of expertly labeled datasets and the intricate,
often nonlinear interplay of stylistic elements. While recent dual-teacher
self-supervised frameworks reduce reliance on labeled data, their linear
projection layers and localized focus struggle to model global compositional
context and complex style-feature interactions. We enhance the dual-teacher
knowledge distillation framework to address these limitations by replacing
conventional MLP projection and prediction heads with Kolmogorov-Arnold
Networks (KANs). Our approach retains complementary guidance from two teacher
networks, one emphasizing localized texture and brushstroke patterns, the other
capturing broader stylistic hierarchies while leveraging KANs' spline-based
activations to model nonlinear feature correlations with mathematical
precision. Experiments on WikiArt and Pandora18k demonstrate that our approach
outperforms the base dual teacher architecture in Top-1 accuracy. Our findings
highlight the importance of KANs in disentangling complex style manifolds,
leading to better linear probe accuracy than MLP projections.

Conclusion: HyCASS为高光谱图像压缩提供了一种有效的可调谐方法，并揭示了光谱和空间压缩的最佳平衡策略。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of hyperspectral data archives in remote sensing (RS),
the need for efficient storage has become essential, driving significant
attention toward learning-based hyperspectral image (HSI) compression. However,
a comprehensive investigation of the individual and joint effects of spectral
and spatial compression on learning-based HSI compression has not been
thoroughly examined yet. Conducting such an analysis is crucial for
understanding how the exploitation of spectral, spatial, and joint
spatio-spectral redundancies affects HSI compression. To address this issue, we
propose Adjustable Spatio-Spectral Hyperspectral Image Compression Network
(HyCASS), a learning-based model designed for adjustable HSI compression in
both spectral and spatial dimensions. HyCASS consists of six main modules: 1)
spectral encoder; 2) spatial encoder; 3) compression ratio (CR) adapter
encoder; 4) CR adapter decoder; 5) spatial decoder; and 6) spectral decoder
module. The modules employ convolutional layers and transformer blocks to
capture both short-range and long-range redundancies. Experimental results on
two HSI benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
adjustable model compared to existing learning-based compression models. Based
on our results, we establish a guideline for effectively balancing spectral and
spatial compression across different CRs, taking into account the spatial
resolution of the HSIs. Our code and pre-trained model weights are publicly
available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/hycass .

Conclusion: RAF不仅适用于人体姿态估计，还能推广到其他依赖空间细节的任务。

Abstract: The Federated Learning (FL) approach enables effective learning across
distributed systems, while preserving user data privacy. To date, research has
primarily focused on addressing statistical heterogeneity and communication
efficiency, through which FL has achieved success in classification tasks.
However, its application to non-classification tasks, such as human pose
estimation, remains underexplored. This paper identifies and investigates a
critical issue termed ``resolution-drift,'' where performance degrades
significantly due to resolution variability across clients. Unlike class-level
heterogeneity, resolution drift highlights the importance of resolution as
another axis of not independent or identically distributed (non-IID) data. To
address this issue, we present resolution-adaptive federated learning (RAF), a
method that leverages heatmap-based knowledge distillation. Through
multi-resolution knowledge distillation between higher-resolution outputs
(teachers) and lower-resolution outputs (students), our approach enhances
resolution robustness without overfitting. Extensive experiments and
theoretical analysis demonstrate that RAF not only effectively mitigates
resolution drift and achieves significant performance improvements, but also
can be integrated seamlessly into existing FL frameworks. Furthermore, although
this paper focuses on human pose estimation, our t-SNE analysis reveals
distinct characteristics between classification and high-resolution
representation tasks, supporting the generalizability of RAF to other tasks
that rely on preserving spatial detail.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了CST Anti-UAV数据集，专注于复杂场景下微小无人机的单目标跟踪，填补了现有数据集的不足，并评估了20种现有方法，发现性能仍有提升空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无人机跟踪数据集缺乏多样性和复杂性，限制了其在真实场景中的应用。为了解决这一问题，作者提出了CST Anti-UAV数据集。

Method: 构建了一个包含220个视频序列和24万高质量标注框的热红外数据集，重点标注微小目标和复杂场景，并首次提供完整的手动帧级属性标注。

Result: 在CST Anti-UAV数据集上评估了20种现有跟踪方法，最优方法仅达到35.92%的准确率，远低于其他数据集的表现。

Conclusion: CST Anti-UAV数据集的发布将推动更鲁棒的跟踪方法和反无人机系统的创新，同时揭示了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: The widespread application of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has raised
serious public safety and privacy concerns, making UAV perception crucial for
anti-UAV tasks. However, existing UAV tracking datasets predominantly feature
conspicuous objects and lack diversity in scene complexity and attribute
representation, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios. To
overcome these limitations, we present the CST Anti-UAV, a new thermal infrared
dataset specifically designed for Single Object Tracking (SOT) in Complex
Scenes with Tiny UAVs (CST). It contains 220 video sequences with over 240k
high-quality bounding box annotations, highlighting two key properties: a
significant number of tiny-sized UAV targets and the diverse and complex
scenes. To the best of our knowledge, CST Anti-UAV is the first dataset to
incorporate complete manual frame-level attribute annotations, enabling precise
evaluations under varied challenges. To conduct an in-depth performance
analysis for CST Anti-UAV, we evaluate 20 existing SOT methods on the proposed
dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that tracking tiny UAVs in complex
environments remains a challenge, as the state-of-the-art method achieves only
35.92% state accuracy, much lower than the 67.69% observed on the Anti-UAV410
dataset. These findings underscore the limitations of existing benchmarks and
the need for further advancements in UAV tracking research. The CST Anti-UAV
benchmark is about to be publicly released, which not only fosters the
development of more robust SOT methods but also drives innovation in anti-UAV
systems.

TL;DR: 3D-R1是一种提升3D视觉语言模型推理能力的基模型，通过高质量合成数据集和动态视角选择策略，显著提升了3D场景理解的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D视觉语言模型在推理和泛化能力上存在不足，主要受限于高质量空间数据和静态视角假设。

Method: 构建Scene-30K合成数据集，采用RLHF策略（如GRPO）和三种奖励函数，并引入动态视角选择策略。

Result: 在多个3D场景基准测试中平均提升10%的性能。

Conclusion: 3D-R1有效提升了3D场景理解的推理和泛化能力。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant strides in 2D
visual understanding tasks, sparking interest in extending these capabilities
to 3D scene understanding. However, current 3D VLMs often struggle with robust
reasoning and generalization due to limitations in high-quality spatial data
and the static nature of viewpoint assumptions. To address these challenges, we
propose 3D-R1, a foundation model that enhances the reasoning capabilities of
3D VLMs. Specifically, we first construct a high-quality synthetic dataset with
CoT, named Scene-30K, leveraging existing 3D-VL datasets and a data engine
based on Gemini 2.5 Pro. It serves as cold-start initialization data for 3D-R1.
Moreover, we leverage RLHF policy such as GRPO in the reinforcement learning
training process to enhance reasoning capabilities and introduce three reward
functions: a perception reward, a semantic similarity reward and a format
reward to maintain detection accuracy and answer semantic precision.
Furthermore, we introduce a dynamic view selection strategy that adaptively
chooses the most informative perspectives for 3D scene understanding. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that 3D-R1 delivers an average improvement of 10%
across various 3D scene benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing
reasoning and generalization in 3D scene understanding. Code:

Conclusion: 该方法在AI驱动的胶囊内窥镜领域取得了显著进展，性能优于现有单任务模型。

Abstract: Video capsule endoscopy has become increasingly important for investigating
the small intestine within the gastrointestinal tract. However, a persistent
challenge remains the short battery lifetime of such compact sensor edge
devices. Integrating artificial intelligence can help overcome this limitation
by enabling intelligent real-time decision- making, thereby reducing the energy
consumption and prolonging the battery life. However, this remains challenging
due to data sparsity and the limited resources of the device restricting the
overall model size. In this work, we introduce a multi-task neural network that
combines the functionalities of precise self-localization within the
gastrointestinal tract with the ability to detect anomalies in the small
intestine within a single model. Throughout the development process, we
consistently restricted the total number of parameters to ensure the
feasibility to deploy such model in a small capsule. We report the first
multi-task results using the recently published Galar dataset, integrating
established multi-task methods and Viterbi decoding for subsequent time-series
analysis. This outperforms current single-task models and represents a
significant ad- vance in AI-based approaches in this field. Our model achieves
an accu- racy of 93.63% on the localization task and an accuracy of 87.48% on
the anomaly detection task. The approach requires only 1 million parameters
while surpassing the current baselines.

curve, we can efficiently identify subsequent sample points without
exhaustively computing all pairwise distances. Our proposal substantially
accelerates farthest point sampling and neighbor search operations while
preserving sampling quality and model performance. By integrating FastPoint
into state-of-the-art 3D point cloud models, we achieve 2.55x end-to-end
speedup on NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU without sacrificing accuracy.

Conclusion: Stable-Sim2Real为3D数据模拟提供了高效解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: 3D data simulation aims to bridge the gap between simulated and real-captured
3D data, which is a fundamental problem for real-world 3D visual tasks. Most 3D
data simulation methods inject predefined physical priors but struggle to
capture the full complexity of real data. An optimal approach involves learning
an implicit mapping from synthetic to realistic data in a data-driven manner,
but progress in this solution has met stagnation in recent studies. This work
explores a new solution path of data-driven 3D simulation, called
Stable-Sim2Real, based on a novel two-stage depth diffusion model. The initial
stage finetunes Stable-Diffusion to generate the residual between the real and
synthetic paired depth, producing a stable but coarse depth, where some local
regions may deviate from realistic patterns. To enhance this, both the
synthetic and initial output depth are fed into a second-stage diffusion, where
diffusion loss is adjusted to prioritize these distinct areas identified by a
3D discriminator. We provide a new benchmark scheme to evaluate 3D data
simulation methods. Extensive experiments show that training the network with
the 3D simulated data derived from our method significantly enhances
performance in real-world 3D visual tasks. Moreover, the evaluation
demonstrates the high similarity between our 3D simulated data and
real-captured patterns. Project page:

Motivation: 传统方法在田间条件下难以准确估计草莓质量，尤其是存在遮挡和姿态变化时。

Method: 使用YOLOv8-Seg进行实例分割，CycleGAN完成遮挡区域，倾斜角校正优化投影面积计算，多项式回归模型将几何特征映射到质量。

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂遮挡条件下的自动化收获和产量监测提供了鲁棒解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate mass estimation of table-top grown strawberries under field
conditions remains challenging due to frequent occlusions and pose variations.
This study proposes a vision-based pipeline integrating RGB-D sensing and deep
learning to enable non-destructive, real-time and online mass estimation. The
method employed YOLOv8-Seg for instance segmentation, Cycle-consistent
generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) for occluded region completion, and
tilt-angle correction to refine frontal projection area calculations. A
polynomial regression model then mapped the geometric features to mass.
Experiments demonstrated mean mass estimation errors of 8.11% for isolated
strawberries and 10.47% for occluded cases. CycleGAN outperformed large mask
inpainting (LaMa) model in occlusion recovery, achieving superior pixel area
ratios (PAR) (mean: 0.978 vs. 1.112) and higher intersection over union (IoU)
scores (92.3% vs. 47.7% in the [0.9-1] range). This approach addresses critical
limitations of traditional methods, offering a robust solution for automated
harvesting and yield monitoring with complex occlusion patterns.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多模态图像配准和融合中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 双曲空间能够更敏感且有效地实现多模态图像配准，Hy-CycleAlign为跨模态图像对齐提供了新思路。

Abstract: Image fusion synthesizes complementary information from multiple sources,
mitigating the inherent limitations of unimodal imaging systems. Accurate image
registration is essential for effective multi-source data fusion. However,
existing registration methods, often based on image translation in Euclidean
space, fail to handle cross-modal misalignment effectively, resulting in
suboptimal alignment and fusion quality. To overcome this limitation, we
explore image alignment in non-Euclidean space and propose a Hyperbolic Cycle
Alignment Network (Hy-CycleAlign). To the best of our knowledge, Hy-CycleAlign
is the first image registration method based on hyperbolic space. It introduces
a dual-path cross-modal cyclic registration framework, in which a forward
registration network aligns cross-modal inputs, while a backward registration
network reconstructs the original image, forming a closed-loop registration
structure with geometric consistency. Additionally, we design a Hyperbolic
Hierarchy Contrastive Alignment (H$^{2}$CA) module, which maps images into
hyperbolic space and imposes registration constraints, effectively reducing
interference caused by modality discrepancies. We further analyze image
registration in both Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces, demonstrating that
hyperbolic space enables more sensitive and effective multi-modal image
registration. Extensive experiments on misaligned multi-modal images
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in
both image alignment and fusion. Our code will be publicly available.

Result: 发现ConvNext和EVA模型与其他模型在像素集大小和位置上显著不同，且误分类图像需要更大的像素集。

Conclusion: 最小充分像素集能有效揭示模型决策差异，为模型选择和优化提供新视角。

Abstract: Machine learning for image classification is an active and rapidly developing
field. With the proliferation of classifiers of different sizes and different
architectures, the problem of choosing the right model becomes more and more
important.
  While we can assess a model's classification accuracy statistically, our
understanding of the way these models work is unfortunately limited. In order
to gain insight into the decision-making process of different vision models, we
propose using minimal sufficient pixels sets to gauge a model's
`concentration': the pixels that capture the essence of an image through the
lens of the model. By comparing position, overlap, and size of sets of pixels,
we identify that different architectures have statistically different
concentration, in both size and position. In particular, ConvNext and EVA
models differ markedly from the others. We also identify that images which are
misclassified are associated with larger pixels sets than correct
classifications.

Result: ART在多个数据集上显著优于基线方法，并能推断未见过的关系概念。

Conclusion: ART不仅提升了VRD性能，还能用于复杂场景的分割，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Visual relation detection (VRD) is the task of identifying the relationships
between objects in a scene. VRD models trained solely on relation detection
data struggle to generalize beyond the relations on which they are trained.
While prompt tuning has been used to adapt vision-language models (VLMs) for
VRD, it uses handcrafted prompts and struggles with novel or complex relations.
We argue that instruction tuning offers a more effective solution by
fine-tuning VLMs on diverse instructional data. We thus introduce ART, an
Adaptive Relation Tuning framework that adapts VLMs for VRD through instruction
tuning and strategic instance selection. By converting VRD datasets into an
instruction tuning format and employing an adaptive sampling algorithm, ART
directs the VLM to focus on informative relations while maintaining
generalizability. Specifically, we focus on the relation classification, where
subject-object boxes are given and the model predicts the predicate between
them. We tune on a held-in set and evaluate across multiple held-out datasets
of varying complexity. Our approach strongly improves over its baselines and
can infer unseen relation concepts, a capability absent in mainstream VRD
methods. We demonstrate ART's practical value by using the predicted relations
for segmenting complex scenes.

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection is valuable for various applications such as
robotics and AR/VR. Existing methods are confined to closed-set settings, where
the training and testing sets consist of the same scenes and/or object
categories. However, real-world applications often introduce new environments
and novel object categories, posing a challenge to these methods. In this
paper, we address monocular 3D object detection in an open-set setting and
introduce the first end-to-end 3D Monocular Open-set Object Detector (3D-MOOD).
We propose to lift the open-set 2D detection into 3D space through our designed
3D bounding box head, enabling end-to-end joint training for both 2D and 3D
tasks to yield better overall performance. We condition the object queries with
geometry prior and overcome the generalization for 3D estimation across diverse
scenes. To further improve performance, we design the canonical image space for
more efficient cross-dataset training. We evaluate 3D-MOOD on both closed-set
settings (Omni3D) and open-set settings (Omni3D to Argoverse 2, ScanNet), and
achieve new state-of-the-art results. Code and models are available at

Abstract: Visual localization is the task of estimating a camera pose in a known
environment. In this paper, we utilize 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based
representations for accurate and privacy-preserving visual localization. We
propose Gaussian Splatting Feature Fields (GSFFs), a scene representation for
visual localization that combines an explicit geometry model (3DGS) with an
implicit feature field. We leverage the dense geometric information and
differentiable rasterization algorithm from 3DGS to learn robust feature
representations grounded in 3D. In particular, we align a 3D scale-aware
feature field and a 2D feature encoder in a common embedding space through a
contrastive framework. Using a 3D structure-informed clustering procedure, we
further regularize the representation learning and seamlessly convert the
features to segmentations, which can be used for privacy-preserving visual
localization. Pose refinement, which involves aligning either feature maps or
segmentations from a query image with those rendered from the GSFFs scene
representation, is used to achieve localization. The resulting privacy- and
non-privacy-preserving localization pipelines, evaluated on multiple real-world
datasets, show state-of-the-art performances.

Conclusion: BeyondGloss框架通过创新的方法有效解决了手语翻译的挑战，展示了其优越性能。

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) is a challenging task that requires bridging
the modality gap between visual and linguistic information while capturing
subtle variations in hand shapes and movements. To address these challenges, we
introduce \textbf{BeyondGloss}, a novel gloss-free SLT framework that leverages
the spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities of Video Large Language Models
(VideoLLMs). Since existing VideoLLMs struggle to model long videos in detail,
we propose a novel approach to generate fine-grained, temporally-aware textual
descriptions of hand motion. A contrastive alignment module aligns these
descriptions with video features during pre-training, encouraging the model to
focus on hand-centric temporal dynamics and distinguish signs more effectively.
To further enrich hand-specific representations, we distill fine-grained
features from HaMeR. Additionally, we apply a contrastive loss between sign
video representations and target language embeddings to reduce the modality gap
in pre-training. \textbf{BeyondGloss} achieves state-of-the-art performance on
the Phoenix14T and CSL-Daily benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the
proposed framework. We will release the code upon acceptance of the paper.

Conclusion: MamV2XCalib在V2X场景中实现了更优且稳定的校准性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: As cooperative systems that leverage roadside cameras to assist autonomous
vehicle perception become increasingly widespread, large-scale precise
calibration of infrastructure cameras has become a critical issue. Traditional
manual calibration methods are often time-consuming, labor-intensive, and may
require road closures. This paper proposes MamV2XCalib, the first V2X-based
infrastructure camera calibration method with the assistance of vehicle-side
LiDAR. MamV2XCalib only requires autonomous vehicles equipped with LiDAR to
drive near the cameras to be calibrated in the infrastructure, without the need
for specific reference objects or manual intervention. We also introduce a new
targetless LiDAR-camera calibration method, which combines multi-scale features
and a 4D correlation volume to estimate the correlation between vehicle-side
point clouds and roadside images. We model the temporal information and
estimate the rotation angles with Mamba, effectively addressing calibration
failures in V2X scenarios caused by defects in the vehicle-side data (such as
occlusions) and large differences in viewpoint. We evaluate MamV2XCalib on the
V2X-Seq and TUMTraf-V2X real-world datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness
and robustness of our V2X-based automatic calibration approach. Compared to
previous LiDAR-camera methods designed for calibration on one car, our approach
achieves better and more stable calibration performance in V2X scenarios with
fewer parameters. The code is available at

Conclusion: MoGA通过结合生成模型和扩散模型，有效解决了单视图3D化身重建的挑战，实现了高保真和一致性。

Abstract: We present MoGA, a novel method to reconstruct high-fidelity 3D Gaussian
avatars from a single-view image. The main challenge lies in inferring unseen
appearance and geometric details while ensuring 3D consistency and realism.
Most previous methods rely on 2D diffusion models to synthesize unseen views;
however, these generated views are sparse and inconsistent, resulting in
unrealistic 3D artifacts and blurred appearance. To address these limitations,
we leverage a generative avatar model, that can generate diverse 3D avatars by
sampling deformed Gaussians from a learned prior distribution. Due to the
limited amount of 3D training data such a 3D model alone cannot capture all
image details of unseen identities. Consequently, we integrate it as a prior,
ensuring 3D consistency by projecting input images into its latent space and
enforcing additional 3D appearance and geometric constraints. Our novel
approach formulates Gaussian avatar creation as a model inversion process by
fitting the generative avatar to synthetic views from 2D diffusion models. The
generative avatar provides a meaningful initialization for model fitting,
enforces 3D regularization, and helps in refining pose estimation. Experiments
show that our method surpasses state-of-the-art techniques and generalizes well
to real-world scenarios. Our Gaussian avatars are also inherently animatable

Abstract: Efficient and high-accuracy 3D occupancy prediction is crucial for ensuring
the performance of autonomous driving (AD) systems. However, many current
methods focus on high accuracy at the expense of real-time processing needs. To
address this challenge of balancing accuracy and inference speed, we propose a
directional pure 2D approach. Our method involves slicing 3D voxel features to
preserve complete vertical geometric information. This strategy compensates for
the loss of height cues in Bird's-Eye View (BEV) representations, thereby
maintaining the integrity of the 3D geometric structure. By employing a
directional attention mechanism, we efficiently extract geometric features from
different orientations, striking a balance between accuracy and computational
efficiency. Experimental results highlight the significant advantages of our
approach for autonomous driving. On the Occ3D-nuScenes, the proposed method
achieves an mIoU of 39.3% and an inference speed of 27.7 FPS, effectively
balancing accuracy and efficiency. In simulations on edge devices, the
inference speed reaches 14.8 FPS, further demonstrating the method's
applicability for real-time deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于时空频率运动感知的视频伪装目标检测方法Vcamba，结合了空间和频率特征，显著提升了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖空间外观特征，但前景与背景的高相似性限制了检测精度。频率特征和Mamba模型的长序列建模能力为改进提供了新思路。

Method: 提出了RFVSS模块提取多尺度空间特征，AFE模块增强频率特征，SLMP和FLMP模块分别建模时空和频率序列，SFMF模块融合双域特征。

Result: 在2个数据集上的6个评估指标中表现优于现有方法，且计算成本更低。

Conclusion: Vcamba通过结合空间和频率特征，实现了高效准确的视频伪装目标检测。

Abstract: Existing video camouflaged object detection (VCOD) methods primarily rely on
spatial appearance features to perceive motion cues for breaking camouflage.
However, the high similarity between foreground and background in VCOD results
in limited discriminability of spatial appearance features (e.g., color and
texture), restricting detection accuracy and completeness. Recent studies
demonstrate that frequency features can not only enhance feature representation
to compensate for appearance limitations but also perceive motion through
dynamic variations in frequency energy. Furthermore, the emerging state space
model called Mamba, enables efficient perception of motion cues in frame
sequences due to its linear-time long-sequence modeling capability. Motivated
by this, we propose a novel visual camouflage Mamba (Vcamba) based on
spatio-frequency motion perception that integrates frequency and spatial
features for efficient and accurate VCOD. Specifically, we propose a receptive
field visual state space (RFVSS) module to extract multi-scale spatial features
after sequence modeling. For frequency learning, we introduce an adaptive
frequency component enhancement (AFE) module with a novel frequency-domain
sequential scanning strategy to maintain semantic consistency. Then we propose
a space-based long-range motion perception (SLMP) module and a frequency-based
long-range motion perception (FLMP) module to model spatio-temporal and
frequency-temporal sequences in spatial and frequency phase domains. Finally,
the space and frequency motion fusion module (SFMF) integrates dual-domain
features for unified motion representation. Experimental results show that our
Vcamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods across 6 evaluation metrics on 2
datasets with lower computation cost, confirming the superiority of Vcamba. Our
code is available at: https://github.com/BoydeLi/Vcamba.

TL;DR: MIDI-B挑战赛旨在标准化DICOM图像去标识工具，基于HIPAA Safe Harbor法规和DICOM属性保密配置文件，确保医疗图像共享时保护患者隐私并保留研究关键元数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗图像共享需符合患者隐私法律，同时保留非PHI元数据以支持AI研究。

Method: 挑战赛分训练、验证和测试三阶段，参与者使用开源或专有工具结合OCR和大语言模型进行去标识。

Result: 测试阶段十支团队完成，正确率在97.91%至99.93%之间。

Conclusion: MIDI-B挑战赛成功验证了规则化去标识方法的有效性，为医疗图像共享提供了标准化平台。

Abstract: The de-identification (deID) of protected health information (PHI) and
personally identifiable information (PII) is a fundamental requirement for
sharing medical images, particularly through public repositories, to ensure
compliance with patient privacy laws. In addition, preservation of non-PHI
metadata to inform and enable downstream development of imaging artificial
intelligence (AI) is an important consideration in biomedical research. The
goal of MIDI-B was to provide a standardized platform for benchmarking of DICOM
image deID tools based on a set of rules conformant to the HIPAA Safe Harbor
regulation, the DICOM Attribute Confidentiality Profiles, and best practices in
preservation of research-critical metadata, as defined by The Cancer Imaging
Archive (TCIA). The challenge employed a large, diverse, multi-center, and
multi-modality set of real de-identified radiology images with synthetic
PHI/PII inserted.
  The MIDI-B Challenge consisted of three phases: training, validation, and
test. Eighty individuals registered for the challenge. In the training phase,
we encouraged participants to tune their algorithms using their in-house or
public data. The validation and test phases utilized the DICOM images
containing synthetic identifiers (of 216 and 322 subjects, respectively). Ten
teams successfully completed the test phase of the challenge. To measure
success of a rule-based approach to image deID, scores were computed as the
percentage of correct actions from the total number of required actions. The
scores ranged from 97.91% to 99.93%. Participants employed a variety of
open-source and proprietary tools with customized configurations, large
language models, and optical character recognition (OCR). In this paper we
provide a comprehensive report on the MIDI-B Challenge's design,
implementation, results, and lessons learned.

Abstract: This study demonstrates that incorporating a consistency heuristic into the
point-matching algorithm \cite{yerebakan2023hierarchical} improves robustness
in matching anatomical locations across pairs of medical images. We validated
our approach on diverse longitudinal internal and public datasets spanning CT
and MRI modalities. Notably, it surpasses state-of-the-art results on the Deep
Lesion Tracking dataset. Additionally, we show that the method effectively
addresses landmark localization. The algorithm operates efficiently on standard

TL;DR: DivControl提出了一种可分解的预训练框架，通过知识分散和多条件训练实现统一可控生成和高效适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在图像到图像生成中要么为每个条件训练单独模型，要么依赖纠缠表示的统一架构，导致泛化能力差和适应成本高。

Method: DivControl通过SVD分解ControlNet为基本组件，利用动态门实现知识分散，并通过表示对齐损失提升条件保真度和训练效率。

Result: DivControl在可控性上达到SOTA，训练成本降低36.4倍，同时在未见条件上表现出强大的零样本和小样本性能。

Conclusion: DivControl展示了卓越的可扩展性、模块化和迁移能力。

Abstract: Diffusion models have advanced from text-to-image (T2I) to image-to-image
(I2I) generation by incorporating structured inputs such as depth maps,
enabling fine-grained spatial control. However, existing methods either train
separate models for each condition or rely on unified architectures with
entangled representations, resulting in poor generalization and high adaptation
costs for novel conditions. To this end, we propose DivControl, a decomposable
pretraining framework for unified controllable generation and efficient
adaptation. DivControl factorizes ControlNet via SVD into basic
components-pairs of singular vectors-which are disentangled into
condition-agnostic learngenes and condition-specific tailors through knowledge
diversion during multi-condition training. Knowledge diversion is implemented
via a dynamic gate that performs soft routing over tailors based on the
semantics of condition instructions, enabling zero-shot generalization and
parameter-efficient adaptation to novel conditions. To further improve
condition fidelity and training efficiency, we introduce a representation
alignment loss that aligns condition embeddings with early diffusion features.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DivControl achieves state-of-the-art
controllability with 36.4$\times$ less training cost, while simultaneously
improving average performance on basic conditions. It also delivers strong
zero-shot and few-shot performance on unseen conditions, demonstrating superior
scalability, modularity, and transferability.

Motivation: 当前SOTA方法在小物体处理上表现不佳，且现有评估设置浪费了昂贵的标注数据。

Method: 提出EMAT，包含内存高效掩码注意力机制、可学习下采样策略和参数效率增强。

Result: 在PASCAL-5$^i$和COCO-20$^i$数据集上表现优于现有方法，参数减少4倍。

Conclusion: EMAT显著提升Few-shot分类与分割性能，并引入更实用的评估设置。

Abstract: Few-shot classification and segmentation (FS-CS) focuses on jointly
performing multi-label classification and multi-class segmentation using few
annotated examples. Although the current state of the art (SOTA) achieves high
accuracy in both tasks, it struggles with small objects. To overcome this, we
propose the Efficient Masked Attention Transformer (EMAT), which improves
classification and segmentation accuracy, especially for small objects. EMAT
introduces three modifications: a novel memory-efficient masked attention
mechanism, a learnable downscaling strategy, and parameter-efficiency
enhancements. EMAT outperforms all FS-CS methods on the PASCAL-5$^i$ and
COCO-20$^i$ datasets, using at least four times fewer trainable parameters.
Moreover, as the current FS-CS evaluation setting discards available
annotations, despite their costly collection, we introduce two novel evaluation
settings that consider these annotations to better reflect practical scenarios.

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低了计算复杂度和资源消耗，为高效训练SNNs提供了新思路。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a biologically plausible framework for
energy-efficient neuromorphic computing. However, it is a challenge to train
SNNs due to their non-differentiability, efficiently. Existing gradient
approximation approaches frequently sacrifice accuracy and face deployment
limitations on edge devices due to the substantial computational requirements
of backpropagation. To address these challenges, we propose a Forward-Forward
(FF) based gradient approximation-free training framework for Spiking Neural
Networks, which treats spiking activations as black-box modules, thereby
eliminating the need for gradient approximation while significantly reducing
computational complexity. Furthermore, we introduce a class-aware complexity
adaptation mechanism that dynamically optimizes the loss function based on
inter-class difficulty metrics, enabling efficient allocation of network
resources across different categories. Experimental results demonstrate that
our proposed training framework achieves test accuracies of 99.58%, 92.13%, and
75.64% on the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets, respectively,
surpassing all existing FF-based SNN approaches. Additionally, our proposed
method exhibits significant advantages in terms of memory access and
computational power consumption.

Abstract: Medical image annotation is constrained by privacy concerns and
labor-intensive labeling, significantly limiting the performance and
generalization of segmentation models. While mask-controllable diffusion models
excel in synthesis, they struggle with precise lesion-mask alignment. We
propose \textbf{Adaptively Distilled ControlNet}, a task-agnostic framework
that accelerates training and optimization through dual-model distillation.
Specifically, during training, a teacher model, conditioned on mask-image
pairs, regularizes a mask-only student model via predicted noise alignment in
parameter space, further enhanced by adaptive regularization based on
lesion-background ratios. During sampling, only the student model is used,
enabling privacy-preserving medical image generation. Comprehensive evaluations
on two distinct medical datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance:
TransUNet improves mDice/mIoU by 2.4%/4.2% on KiTS19, while SANet achieves
2.6%/3.5% gains on Polyps, highlighting its effectiveness and superiority. Code

Result: OmniTraj在零样本迁移中减少70%预测误差，微调后在多个数据集上达到SOTA。

Conclusion: 显式时间条件化是解决零样本迁移问题的有效方法，OmniTraj展示了其优越性。

Abstract: While large-scale pre-training has advanced human trajectory prediction, a
critical challenge remains: zero-shot transfer to unseen dataset with varying
temporal dynamics. State-of-the-art pre-trained models often require
fine-tuning to adapt to new datasets with different frame rates or observation
horizons, limiting their scalability and practical utility. In this work, we
systematically investigate this limitation and propose a robust solution. We
first demonstrate that existing data-aware discrete models struggle when
transferred to new scenarios with shifted temporal setups. We then isolate the
temporal generalization from dataset shift, revealing that a simple, explicit
conditioning mechanism for temporal metadata is a highly effective solution.
Based on this insight, we present OmniTraj, a Transformer-based model
pre-trained on a large-scale, heterogeneous dataset. Our experiments show that
explicitly conditioning on the frame rate enables OmniTraj to achieve
state-of-the-art zero-shot transfer performance, reducing prediction error by
over 70\% in challenging cross-setup scenarios. After fine-tuning, OmniTraj
achieves state-of-the-art results on four datasets, including NBA, JTA,
WorldPose, and ETH-UCY. The code is publicly available:

Conclusion: I2V-GS是首个实现基础设施-车辆视图转换的框架，为自动驾驶数据生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Vast and high-quality data are essential for end-to-end autonomous driving
systems. However, current driving data is mainly collected by vehicles, which
is expensive and inefficient. A potential solution lies in synthesizing data
from real-world images. Recent advancements in 3D reconstruction demonstrate
photorealistic novel view synthesis, highlighting the potential of generating
driving data from images captured on the road. This paper introduces a novel
method, I2V-GS, to transfer the Infrastructure view To the Vehicle view with
Gaussian Splatting. Reconstruction from sparse infrastructure viewpoints and
rendering under large view transformations is a challenging problem. We adopt
the adaptive depth warp to generate dense training views. To further expand the
range of views, we employ a cascade strategy to inpaint warped images, which
also ensures inpainting content is consistent across views. To further ensure
the reliability of the diffusion model, we utilize the cross-view information
to perform a confidenceguided optimization. Moreover, we introduce RoadSight, a
multi-modality, multi-view dataset from real scenarios in infrastructure views.
To our knowledge, I2V-GS is the first framework to generate autonomous driving
datasets with infrastructure-vehicle view transformation. Experimental results
demonstrate that I2V-GS significantly improves synthesis quality under vehicle
view, outperforming StreetGaussian in NTA-Iou, NTL-Iou, and FID by 45.7%,
34.2%, and 14.9%, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高保真3D视频重建对VR/AR中动态场景的实时渲染至关重要，但现有方法在复杂运动和尺度变化下表现不佳。

Method: FlowGaussian-VR包含两个核心组件：基于光流的优化管道（VFR）和流辅助的自适应密集化策略（FAD）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多视角动态重建和新视角合成中显著提升了视觉质量（PSNR增益超过2.5 dB），并减少了动态纹理的模糊伪影。

Conclusion: FlowGaussian-VR通过流增强的速度场建模，实现了更优的动态场景重建效果。

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D video reconstruction is essential for enabling real-time
rendering of dynamic scenes with realistic motion in virtual and augmented
reality (VR/AR). The deformation field paradigm of 3D Gaussian splatting has
achieved near-photorealistic results in video reconstruction due to the great
representation capability of deep deformation networks. However, in videos with
complex motion and significant scale variations, deformation networks often
overfit to irregular Gaussian trajectories, leading to suboptimal visual
quality. Moreover, the gradient-based densification strategy designed for
static scene reconstruction proves inadequate to address the absence of dynamic
content. In light of these challenges, we propose a flow-empowered velocity
field modeling scheme tailored for Gaussian video reconstruction, dubbed
FlowGaussian-VR. It consists of two core components: a velocity field rendering
(VFR) pipeline which enables optical flow-based optimization, and a
flow-assisted adaptive densification (FAD) strategy that adjusts the number and
size of Gaussians in dynamic regions. We validate our model's effectiveness on
multi-view dynamic reconstruction and novel view synthesis with multiple
real-world datasets containing challenging motion scenarios, demonstrating not
only notable visual improvements (over 2.5 dB gain in PSNR) and less blurry
artifacts in dynamic textures, but also regularized and trackable per-Gaussian
trajectories.

Abstract: The deployment of Machine Learning models intraoperatively for tissue
characterisation can assist decision making and guide safe tumour resections.
For image classification models, pixel attribution methods are popular to infer
explainability. However, overconfidence in deep learning model's predictions
translates to overconfidence in pixel attribution. In this paper, we propose
the first approach which incorporates risk estimation into a pixel attribution
method for improved image classification explainability. The proposed method
iteratively applies a classification model with a pixel attribution method to
create a volume of PA maps. This volume is used for the first time, to generate
a pixel-wise distribution of PA values. We introduce a method to generate an
enhanced PA map by estimating the expectation values of the pixel-wise
distributions. In addition, the coefficient of variation (CV) is used to
estimate pixel-wise risk of this enhanced PA map. Hence, the proposed method
not only provides an improved PA map but also produces an estimation of risk on
the output PA values. Performance evaluation on probe-based Confocal Laser
Endomicroscopy (pCLE) data and ImageNet verifies that our improved
explainability method outperforms the state-of-the-art.

in this area restrict the learning aspect only to the feature functions and
still rely on axiomatic modeling for formulating the training loss or for
functional map regularization inside the networks. This limits both the
accuracy and the applicability of the resulting approaches only to scenarios
where assumptions of the axiomatic models hold. In this work, we show, for the
first time, that both in-network regularization and functional map training can
be replaced with data-driven methods. For this, we first train a generative
model of functional maps in the spectral domain using score-based generative
modeling, built from a large collection of high-quality maps. We then exploit
the resulting model to promote the structural properties of ground truth
functional maps on new shape collections. Remarkably, we demonstrate that the
learned models are category-agnostic, and can fully replace commonly used
strategies such as enforcing Laplacian commutativity or orthogonality of
functional maps. Our key technical contribution is a novel distillation
strategy from diffusion models in the spectral domain. Experiments demonstrate
that our learned regularization leads to better results than axiomatic
approaches for zero-shot non-rigid shape matching. Our code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究缺乏基于推理的大规模affordance预测数据，限制了开放世界场景下的有效性。

Method: 构建了包含273k图像、180类别和26k推理指令的RAGNet基准，并提出AffordanceNet框架，结合预训练视觉语言模型和抓取网络。

Result: 在affordance分割基准和真实机器人任务中表现出强大的开放世界泛化能力。

Conclusion: RAGNet和AffordanceNet为开放世界抓取任务提供了有效的数据和方法支持。

Abstract: General robotic grasping systems require accurate object affordance
perception in diverse open-world scenarios following human instructions.
However, current studies suffer from the problem of lacking reasoning-based
large-scale affordance prediction data, leading to considerable concern about
open-world effectiveness. To address this limitation, we build a large-scale
grasping-oriented affordance segmentation benchmark with human-like
instructions, named RAGNet. It contains 273k images, 180 categories, and 26k
reasoning instructions. The images cover diverse embodied data domains, such as
wild, robot, ego-centric, and even simulation data. They are carefully
annotated with an affordance map, while the difficulty of language instructions
is largely increased by removing their category name and only providing
functional descriptions. Furthermore, we propose a comprehensive
affordance-based grasping framework, named AffordanceNet, which consists of a
VLM pre-trained on our massive affordance data and a grasping network that
conditions an affordance map to grasp the target. Extensive experiments on
affordance segmentation benchmarks and real-robot manipulation tasks show that
our model has a powerful open-world generalization ability. Our data and code

TL;DR: DIAS提出了一种改进的Slot Attention方法，通过重新初始化和自蒸馏减少冗余，提升对象表示效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Slot Attention方法存在冗余和分割错误问题，且监督信号仅来自输入重建，忽略了内部信息。

Method: DIAS通过重新初始化减少冗余槽位，并通过自蒸馏优化注意力图。

Result: DIAS在对象发现和识别任务中达到SOTA，同时提升视觉预测和推理能力。

Conclusion: DIAS通过改进Slot Attention机制，显著提升了对象中心学习的性能。

Abstract: Unlike popular solutions based on dense feature maps, Object-Centric Learning
(OCL) represents visual scenes as sub-symbolic object-level feature vectors,
termed slots, which are highly versatile for tasks involving visual modalities.
OCL typically aggregates object superpixels into slots by iteratively applying
competitive cross attention, known as Slot Attention, with the slots as the
query. However, once initialized, these slots are reused naively, causing
redundant slots to compete with informative ones for representing objects. This
often results in objects being erroneously segmented into parts. Additionally,
mainstream methods derive supervision signals solely from decoding slots into
the input's reconstruction, overlooking potential supervision based on internal
information. To address these issues, we propose Slot Attention with
re-Initialization and self-Distillation (DIAS): $\emph{i)}$ We reduce
redundancy in the aggregated slots and re-initialize extra aggregation to
update the remaining slots; $\emph{ii)}$ We drive the bad attention map at the
first aggregation iteration to approximate the good at the last iteration to
enable self-distillation. Experiments demonstrate that DIAS achieves
state-of-the-art on OCL tasks like object discovery and recognition, while also
improving advanced visual prediction and reasoning. Our code is available on

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的任务——Sequential 3D Gaussian Affordance Reasoning，并建立了SeqAffordSplat基准和SeqSplatNet框架，用于解决复杂场景中的长时程3D功能区域推理问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）的方法仅限于单对象、单步交互，无法满足复杂现实应用中的长时程、多对象任务需求。

Method: 提出SeqSplatNet框架，结合大语言模型和条件解码器，通过预训练策略和特征注入机制处理复杂场景几何和语义模糊。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在SeqAffordSplat基准上达到了新的最优性能，成功将功能区域推理扩展到复杂场景级别。

Conclusion: SeqSplatNet有效推动了从单步交互到复杂长时程任务的3D功能区域推理研究。

Abstract: 3D affordance reasoning, the task of associating human instructions with the
functional regions of 3D objects, is a critical capability for embodied agents.
Current methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) are fundamentally limited
to single-object, single-step interactions, a paradigm that falls short of
addressing the long-horizon, multi-object tasks required for complex real-world
applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce the novel task of Sequential 3D
Gaussian Affordance Reasoning and establish SeqAffordSplat, a large-scale
benchmark featuring 1800+ scenes to support research on long-horizon affordance
understanding in complex 3DGS environments. We then propose SeqSplatNet, an
end-to-end framework that directly maps an instruction to a sequence of 3D
affordance masks. SeqSplatNet employs a large language model that
autoregressively generates text interleaved with special segmentation tokens,
guiding a conditional decoder to produce the corresponding 3D mask. To handle
complex scene geometry, we introduce a pre-training strategy, Conditional
Geometric Reconstruction, where the model learns to reconstruct complete
affordance region masks from known geometric observations, thereby building a
robust geometric prior. Furthermore, to resolve semantic ambiguities, we design
a feature injection mechanism that lifts rich semantic features from 2D Vision
Foundation Models (VFM) and fuses them into the 3D decoder at multiple scales.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method sets a new state-of-the-art
on our challenging benchmark, effectively advancing affordance reasoning from
single-step interactions to complex, sequential tasks at the scene level.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种将SMPL-X模型嵌入动态物理交互的方法，通过“半物理”机制实现实时、无学习的物理交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前3D人体模型（如SMPL-X）因运动学特性无法与环境物理交互的问题，如穿透和不真实的物体动态。

Method: 采用“半物理”机制，将运动学动作转化为物理模拟，保持对SMPL-X姿态的运动学控制，同时确保物理交互的合理性。

Result: 有效消除穿透和不真实物体动态，实时运行且无需训练，适用于任意体型和动作。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持运动学动作保真度的同时，无缝集成了物理交互，优于基于强化学习的方法。

Abstract: While current general-purpose 3D human models (e.g., SMPL-X) efficiently
represent accurate human shape and pose, they lacks the ability to physically
interact with the environment due to the kinematic nature. As a result,
kinematic-based interaction models often suffer from issues such as
interpenetration and unrealistic object dynamics. To address this limitation,
we introduce a novel approach that embeds SMPL-X into a tangible entity capable
of dynamic physical interactions with its surroundings. Specifically, we
propose a "half-physics" mechanism that transforms 3D kinematic motion into a
physics simulation. Our approach maintains kinematic control over inherent
SMPL-X poses while ensuring physically plausible interactions with scenes and
objects, effectively eliminating penetration and unrealistic object dynamics.
Unlike reinforcement learning-based methods, which demand extensive and complex
training, our half-physics method is learning-free and generalizes to any body
shape and motion; meanwhile, it operates in real time. Moreover, it preserves
the fidelity of the original kinematic motion while seamlessly integrating
physical interactions

Motivation: GUI接地是计算机使用代理（CUAs）执行实际动作的核心组件，但现有端到端接地模型在挑战性基准测试中准确率不足65%，亟需改进。

Method: 通过实证研究，从数据收集到模型训练详细分析了接地模型的训练细节，开发了Phi-Ground模型家族。

Result: Phi-Ground在5个接地基准测试中表现最佳，在端到端模型设置下，ScreenSpot-pro和UI-Vision得分分别为43.2和27.2。

Conclusion: 论文不仅阐明了接地模型的构建细节，还为其他感知任务提供了借鉴，Phi-Ground的成功展示了其潜力。

Abstract: With the development of multimodal reasoning models, Computer Use Agents
(CUAs), akin to Jarvis from \textit{"Iron Man"}, are becoming a reality. GUI
grounding is a core component for CUAs to execute actual actions, similar to
mechanical control in robotics, and it directly leads to the success or failure
of the system. It determines actions such as clicking and typing, as well as
related parameters like the coordinates for clicks. Current end-to-end
grounding models still achieve less than 65\% accuracy on challenging
benchmarks like ScreenSpot-pro and UI-Vision, indicating they are far from
being ready for deployment. % , as a single misclick can result in unacceptable
consequences. In this work, we conduct an empirical study on the training of
grounding models, examining details from data collection to model training.
Ultimately, we developed the \textbf{Phi-Ground} model family, which achieves
state-of-the-art performance across all five grounding benchmarks for models
under $10B$ parameters in agent settings. In the end-to-end model setting, our
model still achieves SOTA results with scores of \textit{\textbf{43.2}} on
ScreenSpot-pro and \textit{\textbf{27.2}} on UI-Vision. We believe that the
various details discussed in this paper, along with our successes and failures,
not only clarify the construction of grounding models but also benefit other
perception tasks. Project homepage:

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种从稀疏视角视频中重建动态场景的方法，解决了传统多视角密集重建方法在稀疏视角下效果不佳的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要大量校准相机（如Panoptic Studio），成本高且难以应用于野外场景。本文旨在从少量稀疏视角相机中重建动态人类行为。

Method: 通过独立单目重建每个相机的数据，并精心对齐以生成时间和视角一致的动态场景重建。

Result: 在PanopticStudio和Ego-Exo4D数据集上的实验表明，该方法在渲染新视角时优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法在稀疏视角下实现了高质量的动态场景重建，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: We address the problem of dynamic scene reconstruction from sparse-view
videos. Prior work often requires dense multi-view captures with hundreds of
calibrated cameras (e.g. Panoptic Studio). Such multi-view setups are
prohibitively expensive to build and cannot capture diverse scenes in-the-wild.
In contrast, we aim to reconstruct dynamic human behaviors, such as repairing a
bike or dancing, from a small set of sparse-view cameras with complete scene
coverage (e.g. four equidistant inward-facing static cameras). We find that
dense multi-view reconstruction methods struggle to adapt to this sparse-view
setup due to limited overlap between viewpoints. To address these limitations,
we carefully align independent monocular reconstructions of each camera to
produce time- and view-consistent dynamic scene reconstructions. Extensive
experiments on PanopticStudio and Ego-Exo4D demonstrate that our method
achieves higher quality reconstructions than prior art, particularly when
rendering novel views. Code, data, and data-processing scripts are available on

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) and other concept-based interpretable models
show great promise for making AI applications more transparent, which is
essential in fields like medicine. Despite their success, we demonstrate that
CBMs struggle to reliably identify the correct concepts under distribution
shifts. To assess the robustness of CBMs to concept variations, we introduce
SUB: a fine-grained image and concept benchmark containing 38,400 synthetic
images based on the CUB dataset. To create SUB, we select a CUB subset of 33
bird classes and 45 concepts to generate images which substitute a specific
concept, such as wing color or belly pattern. We introduce a novel Tied
Diffusion Guidance (TDG) method to precisely control generated images, where
noise sharing for two parallel denoising processes ensures that both the
correct bird class and the correct attribute are generated. This novel
benchmark enables rigorous evaluation of CBMs and similar interpretable models,
contributing to the development of more robust methods. Our code is available

Result: 在Objaverse数据集上训练，生成质量优于现有方法，并能泛化到真实视频输入。

Conclusion: 为生成高质量动画3D内容提供了新途径。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel framework for video-to-4D generation that
creates high-quality dynamic 3D content from single video inputs. Direct 4D
diffusion modeling is extremely challenging due to costly data construction and
the high-dimensional nature of jointly representing 3D shape, appearance, and
motion. We address these challenges by introducing a Direct 4DMesh-to-GS
Variation Field VAE that directly encodes canonical Gaussian Splats (GS) and
their temporal variations from 3D animation data without per-instance fitting,
and compresses high-dimensional animations into a compact latent space.
Building upon this efficient representation, we train a Gaussian Variation
Field diffusion model with temporal-aware Diffusion Transformer conditioned on
input videos and canonical GS. Trained on carefully-curated animatable 3D
objects from the Objaverse dataset, our model demonstrates superior generation
quality compared to existing methods. It also exhibits remarkable
generalization to in-the-wild video inputs despite being trained exclusively on
synthetic data, paving the way for generating high-quality animated 3D content.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI分割方法针对单个结构，导致模型碎片化且性能不一，缺乏全面的训练数据。CADS旨在通过系统整合数据解决这些问题。

Method: CADS通过整合22,022个CT扫描的大规模数据集（标注167个解剖结构），并基于现有架构开发模型，实现全身CT分割。

Conclusion: CADS通过开源数据集、模型和工具，推动了放射学中稳健AI解决方案的发展，并为临床和研究提供了全面的解剖分析工具。

Abstract: Accurate delineation of anatomical structures in volumetric CT scans is
crucial for diagnosis and treatment planning. While AI has advanced automated
segmentation, current approaches typically target individual structures,
creating a fragmented landscape of incompatible models with varying performance
and disparate evaluation protocols. Foundational segmentation models address
these limitations by providing a holistic anatomical view through a single
model. Yet, robust clinical deployment demands comprehensive training data,
which is lacking in existing whole-body approaches, both in terms of data
heterogeneity and, more importantly, anatomical coverage. In this work, rather
than pursuing incremental optimizations in model architecture, we present CADS,
an open-source framework that prioritizes the systematic integration,
standardization, and labeling of heterogeneous data sources for whole-body CT
segmentation. At its core is a large-scale dataset of 22,022 CT volumes with
complete annotations for 167 anatomical structures, representing a significant
advancement in both scale and coverage, with 18 times more scans than existing
collections and 60% more distinct anatomical targets. Building on this diverse
dataset, we develop the CADS-model using established architectures for
accessible and automated full-body CT segmentation. Through comprehensive
evaluation across 18 public datasets and an independent real-world hospital
cohort, we demonstrate advantages over SoTA approaches. Notably, thorough
testing of the model's performance in segmentation tasks from radiation
oncology validates its direct utility for clinical interventions. By making our
large-scale dataset, our segmentation models, and our clinical software tool
publicly available, we aim to advance robust AI solutions in radiology and make
comprehensive anatomical analysis accessible to clinicians and researchers
alike.

Motivation: 皮肤病分类的深度学习模型需要大规模、多样化且标注良好的数据集，但隐私问题、标注成本高和人口代表性不足限制了数据可用性。

Method: LesionGen利用结构化、概念丰富的皮肤病描述（来自专家标注和伪生成报告）微调预训练扩散模型，生成基于皮肤病学描述的图像。

Result: 仅使用合成数据训练的模型在分类准确率上与真实数据训练的模型相当，且在少数子群表现上有显著提升。

Conclusion: LesionGen为皮肤病图像合成提供了有效解决方案，弥补了数据稀缺问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Deep learning models for skin disease classification require large, diverse,
and well-annotated datasets. However, such resources are often limited due to
privacy concerns, high annotation costs, and insufficient demographic
representation. While text-to-image diffusion probabilistic models (T2I-DPMs)
offer promise for medical data synthesis, their use in dermatology remains
underexplored, largely due to the scarcity of rich textual descriptions in
existing skin image datasets. In this work, we introduce LesionGen, a
clinically informed T2I-DPM framework for dermatology image synthesis. Unlike
prior methods that rely on simplistic disease labels, LesionGen is trained on
structured, concept-rich dermatological captions derived from expert
annotations and pseudo-generated, concept-guided reports. By fine-tuning a
pretrained diffusion model on these high-quality image-caption pairs, we enable
the generation of realistic and diverse skin lesion images conditioned on
meaningful dermatological descriptions. Our results demonstrate that models
trained solely on our synthetic dataset achieve classification accuracy
comparable to those trained on real images, with notable gains in worst-case
subgroup performance. Code and data are available here.

Result: 在激进采样条件下，方法显著提升了收敛性和重建质量，优于传统优化流程。

Conclusion: 该方法将生成建模与逆问题求解结合，为高维数据恢复提供了更准确和稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: Recovering high-dimensional statistical structure from limited measurements
is a fundamental challenge in hyperspectral imaging, where capturing
full-resolution data is often infeasible due to sensor, bandwidth, or
acquisition constraints. A common workaround is to partition measurements and
estimate local statistics-such as the covariance matrix-using only partial
observations. However, this strategy introduces noise in the optimization
gradients, especially when each partition contains few samples. In this work,
we reinterpret this accumulation of gradient noise as a diffusion process,
where successive partitions inject increasing uncertainty into the learning
signal. Building on this insight, we propose a novel framework that leverages
denoising diffusion models to learn a reverse process in gradient space. The
model is trained to map noisy gradient estimates toward clean, well-conditioned
updates, effectively preconditioning the optimization. Our approach bridges
generative modeling and inverse problem solving, improving convergence and
reconstruction quality under aggressive sampling regimes. We validate our
method on hyperspectral recovery tasks, demonstrating significant gains in
accuracy and stability over traditional optimization pipelines.

offers a library of composable operators, proximable functionals, and
optimization algorithms, including a unified Fourier operator for all common
trajectories and an extended phase graph simulation for quantitative MR. These
components are used to create ready-to-use implementations of key
reconstruction algorithms. Third, for deep learning, MRpro includes essential
building blocks such as data consistency layers, differentiable optimization
layers, and state-of-the-art backbone networks and integrates public datasets
to facilitate reproducibility. MRpro is developed as a collaborative project
supported by automated quality control. We demonstrate the versatility of MRpro
across multiple applications, including Cartesian, radial, and spiral
acquisitions; motion-corrected reconstruction; cardiac MR fingerprinting;
learned spatially adaptive regularization weights; model-based learned image

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于学习的方法在sRGB域下采样时存在模糊和伪影问题，而RAW图像缺乏专门的下采样框架。

Method: 使用小波变换的无信息损失特性，提出低频任意尺度下采样模块（LASDM）和高频预测模块（HFPM），结合能量最大化损失。

Result: 在非整数和整数尺度下均优于现有方法，定量和视觉评估均表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法在RAW图像下采样中表现出色，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: Image downscaling is critical for efficient storage and transmission of
high-resolution (HR) images. Existing learning-based methods focus on
performing downscaling within the sRGB domain, which typically suffers from
blurred details and unexpected artifacts. RAW images, with their unprocessed
photonic information, offer greater flexibility but lack specialized
downscaling frameworks. In this paper, we propose a wavelet-based recurrent
reconstruction framework that leverages the information lossless attribute of
wavelet transformation to fulfill the arbitrary-scale RAW image downscaling in
a coarse-to-fine manner, in which the Low-Frequency Arbitrary-Scale Downscaling
Module (LASDM) and the High-Frequency Prediction Module (HFPM) are proposed to
preserve structural and textural integrity of the reconstructed low-resolution
(LR) RAW images, alongside an energy-maximization loss to align high-frequency
energy between HR and LR domain. Furthermore, we introduce the Realistic
Non-Integer RAW Downscaling (Real-NIRD) dataset, featuring a non-integer
downscaling factor of 1.3$\times$, and incorporate it with publicly available
datasets with integer factors (2$\times$, 3$\times$, 4$\times$) for
comprehensive benchmarking arbitrary-scale image downscaling purposes.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
state-of-the-art competitors both quantitatively and visually. The code and

Method: EMORe在EM框架中结合自适应校正和异常值拒绝，通过E步和M步交替优化。

Result: 在模拟和实际数据中，EMORe显著提升图像质量、边缘锐度和运动伪影减少。

Conclusion: EMORe虽增加计算复杂度，但显著提升5D心脏MRI的临床适用性和诊断信心。

Abstract: We propose EMORe, an adaptive reconstruction method designed to enhance
motion robustness in free-running, free-breathing self-gated 5D cardiac
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Traditional self-gating-based motion binning
for 5D MRI often results in residual motion artifacts due to inaccuracies in
cardiac and respiratory signal extraction and sporadic bulk motion,
compromising clinical utility. EMORe addresses these issues by integrating
adaptive inter-bin correction and explicit outlier rejection within an
expectation-maximization (EM) framework, whereby the E-step and M-step are
executed alternately until convergence. In the E-step, probabilistic (soft) bin
assignments are refined by correcting misassignment of valid data and rejecting
motion-corrupted data to a dedicated outlier bin. In the M-step, the image
estimate is improved using the refined soft bin assignments. Validation in a
simulated 5D MRXCAT phantom demonstrated EMORe's superior performance compared
to standard compressed sensing reconstruction, showing significant improvements
in peak signal-to-noise ratio, structural similarity index, edge sharpness, and
bin assignment accuracy across varying levels of simulated bulk motion. In vivo
validation in 13 volunteers further confirmed EMORe's robustness, significantly
enhancing blood-myocardium edge sharpness and reducing motion artifacts
compared to compressed sensing, particularly in scenarios with controlled
coughing-induced motion. Although EMORe incurs a modest increase in
computational complexity, its adaptability and robust handling of bulk motion
artifacts significantly enhance the clinical applicability and diagnostic
confidence of 5D cardiac MRI.

Motivation: 当前MRI手动分割方法耗时且依赖专家，资源匮乏地区尤其受影响。BraTS-Lighthouse 2025挑战旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 基于MedNeXt V2，引入更大的感兴趣区域、改进的nnU-Net v2架构骨架和稳健的模型集成系统。

Result: 在隐藏验证集上，平均LesionWise DSC为0.897，NSD在0.5 mm和1.0 mm容忍度下分别为0.541和0.84。

Conclusion: EMedNeXt在资源受限环境下表现出色，为脑肿瘤分割提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Brain cancer affects millions worldwide, and in nearly every clinical
setting, doctors rely on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to diagnose and
monitor gliomas. However, the current standard for tumor quantification through
manual segmentation of multi-parametric MRI is time-consuming, requires expert
radiologists, and is often infeasible in under-resourced healthcare systems.
This problem is especially pronounced in low-income regions, where MRI scanners
are of lower quality and radiology expertise is scarce, leading to incorrect
segmentation and quantification. In addition, the number of acquired MRI scans
in Africa is typically small. To address these challenges, the BraTS-Lighthouse
2025 Challenge focuses on robust tumor segmentation in sub-Saharan Africa
(SSA), where resource constraints and image quality degradation introduce
significant shifts. In this study, we present EMedNeXt -- an enhanced brain
tumor segmentation framework based on MedNeXt V2 with deep supervision and
optimized post-processing pipelines tailored for SSA. EMedNeXt introduces three
key contributions: a larger region of interest, an improved nnU-Net v2-based
architectural skeleton, and a robust model ensembling system. Evaluated on the
hidden validation set, our solution achieved an average LesionWise DSC of 0.897
with an average LesionWise NSD of 0.541 and 0.84 at a tolerance of 0.5 mm and
1.0 mm, respectively.

Abstract: Automatic segmentation of neuronal topology is critical for handling large
scale neuroimaging data, as it can greatly accelerate neuron annotation and
analysis. However, the intricate morphology of neuronal branches and the
occlusions among fibers pose significant challenges for deep learning based
segmentation. To address these issues, we propose an improved framework: First,
we introduce a deep network that outputs pixel level embedding vectors and
design a corresponding loss function, enabling the learned features to
effectively distinguish different neuronal connections within occluded regions.
Second, building on this model, we develop an end to end pipeline that directly
maps raw neuronal images to SWC formatted neuron structure trees. Finally,
recognizing that existing evaluation metrics fail to fully capture segmentation
accuracy, we propose a novel topological assessment metric to more
appropriately quantify the quality of neuron segmentation and reconstruction.
Experiments on our fMOST imaging dataset demonstrate that, compared to several
classical methods, our approach significantly reduces the error rate in
neuronal topology reconstruction.

Motivation: 传统深度神经网络在资源受限的边缘设备上运行困难，且RGB图像转换消耗额外能量。

Result: 分类准确率达93.06%，每张图像仅需5.31μJ能量。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了视频胶囊内窥镜的能效，延长了电池寿命。

Abstract: For many real-world applications involving low-power sensor edge devices deep
neural networks used for image classification might not be suitable. This is
due to their typically large model size and require- ment of operations often
exceeding the capabilities of such resource lim- ited devices. Furthermore,
camera sensors usually capture images with a Bayer color filter applied, which
are subsequently converted to RGB images that are commonly used for neural
network training. However, on resource-constrained devices, such conversions
demands their share of energy and optimally should be skipped if possible. This
work ad- dresses the need for hardware-suitable AI targeting sensor edge
devices by means of the Video Capsule Endoscopy, an important medical proce-
dure for the investigation of the small intestine, which is strongly limited by
its battery lifetime. Accurate organ classification is performed with a final
accuracy of 93.06% evaluated directly on Bayer images involv- ing a CNN with
only 63,000 parameters and time-series analysis in the form of Viterbi
decoding. Finally, the process of capturing images with a camera and raw image
processing is demonstrated with a customized PULPissimo System-on-Chip with a
RISC-V core and an ultra-low power hardware accelerator providing an
energy-efficient AI-based image clas- sification approach requiring just 5.31
{\mu}J per image. As a result, it is possible to save an average of 89.9% of
energy before entering the small intestine compared to classic video capsules.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in learning-based lossy compression algorithms,
standardizing codecs remains a critical challenge. In this paper, we present
the JPEG Processing Neural Operator (JPNeO), a next-generation JPEG algorithm
that maintains full backward compatibility with the current JPEG format. Our
JPNeO improves chroma component preservation and enhances reconstruction
fidelity compared to existing artifact removal methods by incorporating neural
operators in both the encoding and decoding stages. JPNeO achieves practical
benefits in terms of reduced memory usage and parameter count. We further
validate our hypothesis about the existence of a space with high mutual
information through empirical evidence. In summary, the JPNeO functions as a
high-performance out-of-the-box image compression pipeline without changing

Result: 结果表明，持续学习（尤其是基于记忆的方法）能显著提升模型性能。

Conclusion: 持续学习有望支持开发可部署的疟疾CAD工具。

Abstract: Malaria remains a major global health challenge, particularly in low-resource
settings where access to expert microscopy may be limited. Deep learning-based
computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have been developed and demonstrate
promising performance on thin blood smear images. However, their clinical
deployment may be hindered by limited generalization across sites with varying
conditions. Yet very few practical solutions have been proposed. In this work,
we investigate continual learning (CL) as a strategy to enhance the robustness
of malaria CAD models to domain shifts. We frame the problem as a
domain-incremental learning scenario, where a YOLO-based object detector must
adapt to new acquisition sites while retaining performance on previously seen
domains. We evaluate four CL strategies, two rehearsal-based and two
regularization-based methods, on real-life conditions thanks to a multi-site
clinical dataset of thin blood smear images. Our results suggest that CL, and
rehearsal-based methods in particular, can significantly improve performance.
These findings highlight the potential of continual learning to support the
development of deployable, field-ready CAD tools for malaria.

Motivation: 传统医学图像分割方法在拓扑约束下表现不佳，现有拓扑感知方法计算复杂度高，难以应用于高维数据。

Method: 通过欧拉特性快速计算拓扑误差，生成拓扑违规图，并利用拓扑感知校正网络优化分割结果。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在2D和3D数据集上显著提高了拓扑正确性，同时保持了像素级分割精度。

Conclusion: 该方法为拓扑敏感的医学图像分割提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning-based medical image segmentation techniques have shown
promising results when evaluated based on conventional metrics such as the Dice
score or Intersection-over-Union. However, these fully automatic methods often
fail to meet clinically acceptable accuracy, especially when topological
constraints should be observed, e.g., continuous boundaries or closed surfaces.
In medical image segmentation, the correctness of a segmentation in terms of
the required topological genus sometimes is even more important than the
pixel-wise accuracy. Existing topology-aware approaches commonly estimate and
constrain the topological structure via the concept of persistent homology
(PH). However, these methods are difficult to implement for high dimensional
data due to their polynomial computational complexity. To overcome this
problem, we propose a novel and fast approach for topology-aware segmentation
based on the Euler Characteristic ($\chi$). First, we propose a fast
formulation for $\chi$ computation in both 2D and 3D. The scalar $\chi$ error
between the prediction and ground-truth serves as the topological evaluation
metric. Then we estimate the spatial topology correctness of any segmentation
network via a so-called topological violation map, i.e., a detailed map that
highlights regions with $\chi$ errors. Finally, the segmentation results from
the arbitrary network are refined based on the topological violation maps by a
topology-aware correction network. Our experiments are conducted on both 2D and
3D datasets and show that our method can significantly improve topological
correctness while preserving pixel-wise segmentation accuracy.

Motivation: 现有领域泛化基准主要关注跨中心变化，而忽略了序列间的显著差异。胰腺分割由于器官小、对比度低等问题，在现有方法中表现不佳，且公共数据集中代表性不足。

Method: 提出PancreasDG数据集，包含563个MRI扫描，来自6个机构，涵盖不同序列。通过双盲双次协议生成精确标注，并提出一种利用解剖不变性的半监督方法。

Conclusion: PancreasDG为医学影像领域泛化设定了新基准，数据集和代码将公开。

Abstract: Clinical magnetic-resonance (MR) protocols generate many T1 and T2 sequences
whose appearance differs more than the acquisition sites that produce them.
Existing domain-generalization benchmarks focus almost on cross-center shifts
and overlook this dominant source of variability. Pancreas segmentation remains
a major challenge in abdominal imaging: the gland is small, irregularly,
surrounded by organs and fat, and often suffers from low T1 contrast.
State-of-the-art deep networks that already achieve >90% Dice on the liver or
kidneys still miss 20-30% of the pancreas. The organ is also systematically
under-represented in public cross-domain benchmarks, despite its clinical
importance in early cancer detection, surgery, and diabetes research. To close
this gap, we present PancreasDG, a large-scale multi-center 3D MRI pancreas
segmentation dataset for investigating domain generalization in medical
imaging. The dataset comprises 563 MRI scans from six institutions, spanning
both venous phase and out-of-phase sequences, enabling study of both
cross-center and cross-sequence variations with pixel-accurate pancreas masks
created by a double-blind, two-pass protocol. Through comprehensive analysis,
we reveal three insights: (i) limited sampling introduces significant variance
that may be mistaken for distribution shifts, (ii) cross-center performance
correlates with source domain performance for identical sequences, and (iii)
cross-sequence shifts require specialized solutions. We also propose a
semi-supervised approach that leverages anatomical invariances, significantly
outperforming state-of-the-art domain generalization techniques with 61.63%
Dice score improvements and 87.00% on two test centers for cross-sequence
segmentation. PancreasDG sets a new benchmark for domain generalization in
medical imaging. Dataset, code, and models will be available at

Abstract: High-resolution satellite imagery is essential for geospatial analysis, yet
differences in spatial resolution across satellite sensors present challenges
for data fusion and downstream applications. Super-resolution techniques can
help bridge this gap, but existing methods rely on artificially downscaled

work, we develop a preliminary framework to align and Harmonized Landsat
Sentinel 30m(HLS 30) imagery using Harmonized Landsat Sentinel 10m(HLS10) as a
reference from the HLS dataset. Our approach aims to bridge the resolution gap
between these sensors and improve the quality of super-resolved Landsat
imagery. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness
of our method, showing its potential for enhancing satellite-based sensing
applications. This study provides insights into the feasibility of
heterogeneous satellite image super-resolution and highlights key
considerations for future advancements in the field.

Method: 通过在场景光照中嵌入噪声调制，为视频添加时间水印，该水印记录了未篡改场景的图像信息。

Result: 即使攻击者知道该方法，伪造具有可信编码的视频仍需解决更困难的对抗性问题，从而有效保护高价值场景。

Conclusion: 该方法为控制光照但无法控制摄像头的场景（如公共活动）提供了一种有前景的视频防伪解决方案。

Abstract: The proliferation of advanced tools for manipulating video has led to an arms
race, pitting those who wish to sow disinformation against those who want to
detect and expose it. Unfortunately, time favors the ill-intentioned in this
race, with fake videos growing increasingly difficult to distinguish from real
ones. At the root of this trend is a fundamental advantage held by those
manipulating media: equal access to a distribution of what we consider
authentic (i.e., "natural") video. In this paper, we show how coding very
subtle, noise-like modulations into the illumination of a scene can help combat
this advantage by creating an information asymmetry that favors verification.
Our approach effectively adds a temporal watermark to any video recorded under
coded illumination. However, rather than encoding a specific message, this
watermark encodes an image of the unmanipulated scene as it would appear lit
only by the coded illumination. We show that even when an adversary knows that
our technique is being used, creating a plausible coded fake video amounts to
solving a second, more difficult version of the original adversarial content
creation problem at an information disadvantage. This is a promising avenue for
protecting high-stakes settings like public events and interviews, where the
content on display is a likely target for manipulation, and while the
illumination can be controlled, the cameras capturing video cannot.

Conclusion: XSpecMesh是一种高效且质量保持的加速方案。

Abstract: Current auto-regressive models can generate high-quality, topologically
precise meshes; however, they necessitate thousands-or even tens of
thousands-of next-token predictions during inference, resulting in substantial
latency. We introduce XSpecMesh, a quality-preserving acceleration method for
auto-regressive mesh generation models. XSpecMesh employs a lightweight,
multi-head speculative decoding scheme to predict multiple tokens in parallel
within a single forward pass, thereby accelerating inference. We further
propose a verification and resampling strategy: the backbone model verifies
each predicted token and resamples any tokens that do not meet the quality
criteria. In addition, we propose a distillation strategy that trains the
lightweight decoding heads by distilling from the backbone model, encouraging
their prediction distributions to align and improving the success rate of
speculative predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
achieves a 1.7x speedup without sacrificing generation quality. Our code will
be released.

Motivation: 传统雷达干涉绝对相位的定义基于理想化的距离差，无法适用于复杂动态目标，因此需要一种更通用的观测定义。

Method: 提出通过时间解缠相位的方法定义绝对相位，并分析绝对相位奇点对多频率技术和多维干涉图解缠的影响。

Result: 绝对相位在点目标中与距离差成正比，但在循环变化的目标中可能非零且无法解释为距离差。绝对相位奇点会导致相位重建困难。

Conclusion: 通用绝对相位定义和数学分析为InSAR处理链提供了全面评估，并支持在低相干性导致相位奇点时的观测解释。

Abstract: The radar interferometric absolute phase is essential for estimating
topography and displacements. However, its conventional definition based on the
range difference is idealized in that it cannot be applied to complex, dynamic
targets. Here, a universal observational definition is proposed, which is
easiest to describe for differential interferometry: The absolute phase is
determined by temporally unwrapping the phase while continuously varying the
intermediate acquisition time between primary and secondary acquisitions. This
absolute phase is typically not directly observable because a continuous series
of observations is required. The absolute phase of a point target is
proportional to the range difference, matching the conventional definition. For
general targets undergoing a cyclic change, the absolute phase may be nonzero
and then cannot be interpreted as a range difference. When a phase singularity
(vanishing coherence) occurs at an intermediate time, the absolute phase
becomes undefined, a situation termed an absolute phase singularity. Absolute
phase singularities complicate absolute phase reconstruction through
multifrequency techniques and through unwrapping multidimensional
interferograms. They leave no trace in an interferogram, but unwrapping paths
need to avoid those across which the absolute phase jumps by nonzero integer
multiples of $2 \pi$. Mathematical analyses identify conditions for
unwrapping-based reconstruction up to a constant, accounting for absolute phase
singularities, undersampling and noise. The general definition of the absolute
phase and the mathematical analyses enable a comprehensive appraisal of InSAR
processing chains and support the interpretation of observations whenever low
coherence engenders phase and absolute phase singularities.

Conclusion: 该方法为地球内部成像提供了更可靠的工具，并揭示了Kilauea岩浆系统的详细结构。

Abstract: Images of the Earth's interior can provide us with insight into the
underlying properties of the Earth, such as how seismic activity might emerge
and the interplay between seismic and volcanic activity. Understanding these
systems requires reliable high-resolution images to understand mechanisms and
estimate physical quantities. However, reliable images are often difficult to
obtain due to the non-linear nature of seismic wave propagation and the
ill-posedness of the related inverse problem. Reconstructions rely on good
initial estimates as well as hand-crafted priors, which can ultimately bias
solutions. In our work, we present a 3D reconstruction of Kilauea's magmatic
system at a previously unattained resolution. Our eikonal tomography procedure
improves upon prior imaging results of Kilauea through increased resolution and
per-pixel uncertainties estimated through variational inference. In particular,
solving eikonal imaging using variational inference with stochastic gradient
descent enables stable inversion and uncertainty quantification in the absence
of strong prior knowledge of the velocity structure. Our work makes two key
contributions: developing a stochastic eikonal tomography scheme with
uncertainty quantification and illuminating the structure and melt quantity of
the magmatic system that underlies Kilauea.

Result: 实验表明，该框架显著减少了幻觉，提高了模型的准确性、可解释性和可靠性。

Conclusion: EH-Benchmark 为 MLLMs 在眼科诊断中的幻觉问题提供了有效的评估和解决方案。

Abstract: Medical Large Language Models (MLLMs) play a crucial role in ophthalmic
diagnosis, holding significant potential to address vision-threatening
diseases. However, their accuracy is constrained by hallucinations stemming
from limited ophthalmic knowledge, insufficient visual localization and
reasoning capabilities, and a scarcity of multimodal ophthalmic data, which
collectively impede precise lesion detection and disease diagnosis.
Furthermore, existing medical benchmarks fail to effectively evaluate various
types of hallucinations or provide actionable solutions to mitigate them. To
address the above challenges, we introduce EH-Benchmark, a novel ophthalmology
benchmark designed to evaluate hallucinations in MLLMs. We categorize MLLMs'
hallucinations based on specific tasks and error types into two primary
classes: Visual Understanding and Logical Composition, each comprising multiple
subclasses. Given that MLLMs predominantly rely on language-based reasoning
rather than visual processing, we propose an agent-centric, three-phase
framework, including the Knowledge-Level Retrieval stage, the Task-Level Case
Studies stage, and the Result-Level Validation stage. Experimental results show
that our multi-agent framework significantly mitigates both types of
hallucinations, enhancing accuracy, interpretability, and reliability. Our

Motivation: 当前基准无法直接评估多模态真实世界规划能力，且缺乏跨模态约束，MPCC旨在解决这些问题。

Method: MPCC设计了三个真实任务（航班、日历、会议规划），引入复杂约束（预算、时间、空间）和难度分级。

Result: 实验显示，闭源模型仅21.3%生成可行计划，开源模型平均低于11%，且模型对约束复杂度敏感。

Conclusion: MPCC为多模态约束规划提供了严格评估框架，凸显了约束感知推理在MLLM应用中的重要性。

Abstract: Multimodal planning capabilities refer to the ability to predict, reason, and
design steps for task execution with multimodal context, which is essential for
complex reasoning and decision-making across multiple steps. However, current
benchmarks face two key challenges: (1) they cannot directly assess multimodal
real-world planning capabilities, and (2) they lack constraints or implicit
constraints across modalities. To address these issues, we introduce Multimodal
Planning with Complex Constraints (MPCC), the first benchmark to systematically
evaluate MLLMs' ability to handle multimodal constraints in planning. To
address the first challenge, MPCC focuses on three real-world tasks: Flight
Planning, Calendar Planning, and Meeting Planning. To solve the second
challenge, we introduce complex constraints (e.g. budget, temporal, and
spatial) in these tasks, with graded difficulty levels (EASY, MEDIUM, HARD) to
separate constraint complexity from search space expansion. Experiments on 13
advanced MLLMs reveal significant challenges: closed-source models achieve only
21.3% feasible plans, while open-source models average below 11%. Additionally,
we observe that MLLMs are highly sensitive to constraint complexity and that
traditional multimodal prompting strategies fail in multi-constraint scenarios.
Our work formalizes multimodal constraints in planning, provides a rigorous
evaluation framework, and highlights the need for advancements in
constraint-aware reasoning for real-world MLLM applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展CAD范式，引入复数控制点和权重，以利用复数射影变换简化曲线设计并降低曲线次数。

Method: 通过复数控制多边形和权重描述曲线，利用复数射影变换（如几何反演）和多项式结式验证曲线降阶。

Result: 复数框架允许曲线降阶，并提供判断有理三次曲线是否为圆锥曲线的简单公式。

Conclusion: 复数贝塞尔曲线框架为曲线设计提供了更灵活的工具，尤其在降阶和变换方面具有优势。

Abstract: In this paper we develop the formalism of rational complex Bezier curves.
This framework is a simple extension of the CAD paradigm, since it describes
arc of curves in terms of control polygons and weights, which are extended to
complex values. One of the major advantages of this extension is that we may
make use of two different groups of projective transformations. Besides the
group of projective transformations of the real plane, we have the group of
complex projective transformations. This allows us to apply useful
transformations like the geometric inversion to curves in design. In addition
to this, the use of the complex formulation allows to lower the degree of the
curves in some cases. This can be checked using the resultant of two
polynomials and provides a simple formula for determining whether a rational
cubic curve is a conic or not. Examples of application of the formalism to
classical curves are included.

*Jaeseok Park,Chanoh Park,Minsu Kim,Soohwan Kim*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GSFusion是一种结合LiDAR、惯性和视觉的在线映射系统，通过全局位姿图优化和高效高斯初始化策略，解决了3D高斯溅射（3DGS）在稀疏数据和全局对齐上的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于相机传感器的3DGS方法存在计算负载高、在低纹理或光照差环境中失效以及操作范围短的问题，而LiDAR的引入带来了新的挑战，如全局对齐需求高和优化时间长。

Method: 提出了GSFusion系统，采用全局位姿图优化中的面元到面元约束确保高精度地图一致性，并利用像素感知高斯初始化策略和有界Sigmoid约束处理稀疏数据。

Result: 在公开和自有数据集上的实验表明，该系统在渲染质量和地图构建效率上优于现有3DGS SLAM系统。

Conclusion: GSFusion通过融合LiDAR、惯性和视觉数据，有效解决了3DGS在稀疏数据和全局对齐上的问题，提升了渲染质量和效率。

Abstract: While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has revolutionized photorealistic mapping,
conventional approaches based on camera sensor, even RGB-D, suffer from
fundamental limitations such as high computational load, failure in
environments with poor texture or illumination, and short operational ranges.
LiDAR emerges as a robust alternative, but its integration with 3DGS introduces
new challenges, such as the need for exceptional global alignment for
photorealistic quality and prolonged optimization times caused by sparse data.
To address these challenges, we propose GSFusion, an online
LiDAR-Inertial-Visual mapping system that ensures high-precision map
consistency through a surfel-to-surfel constraint in the global pose-graph
optimization. To handle sparse data, our system employs a pixel-aware Gaussian
initialization strategy for efficient representation and a bounded sigmoid
constraint to prevent uncontrolled Gaussian growth. Experiments on public and
our datasets demonstrate our system outperforms existing 3DGS SLAM systems in
terms of rendering quality and map-building efficiency.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人模仿学习中大规模高质量数据稀缺的问题，利用人类操作视频的丰富行为先验。

Method: 两阶段训练：预训练于人类操作数据，跨具身微调于机器人数据；基于扩散变换器架构，使用流匹配建模复杂动作分布。

Result: 在仿真和现实实验中分别比从头训练提升13.9%和40.5%，优于现有方法Pi0和RDT。

Conclusion: 人类操作数据可作为学习机器人双手机器人操作策略的强大基础。

Abstract: Imitation learning for robotic manipulation faces a fundamental challenge:
the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality robot demonstration data. Recent
robotic foundation models often pre-train on cross-embodiment robot datasets to
increase data scale, while they face significant limitations as the diverse
morphologies and action spaces across different robot embodiments make unified
training challenging. In this paper, we present H-RDT (Human to Robotics
Diffusion Transformer), a novel approach that leverages human manipulation data
to enhance robot manipulation capabilities. Our key insight is that large-scale
egocentric human manipulation videos with paired 3D hand pose annotations
provide rich behavioral priors that capture natural manipulation strategies and
can benefit robotic policy learning. We introduce a two-stage training
paradigm: (1) pre-training on large-scale egocentric human manipulation data,
and (2) cross-embodiment fine-tuning on robot-specific data with modular action
encoders and decoders. Built on a diffusion transformer architecture with 2B
parameters, H-RDT uses flow matching to model complex action distributions.
Extensive evaluations encompassing both simulation and real-world experiments,
single-task and multitask scenarios, as well as few-shot learning and
robustness assessments, demonstrate that H-RDT outperforms training from
scratch and existing state-of-the-art methods, including Pi0 and RDT, achieving
significant improvements of 13.9% and 40.5% over training from scratch in
simulation and real-world experiments, respectively. The results validate our
core hypothesis that human manipulation data can serve as a powerful foundation
for learning bimanual robotic manipulation policies.

Conclusion: 语言增强的认知框架有望提升自动驾驶系统的安全性、可解释性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems face significant challenges in achieving
human-like adaptability, robustness, and interpretability in complex,
open-world environments. These challenges stem from fragmented architectures,
limited generalization to novel scenarios, and insufficient semantic extraction
from perception. To address these limitations, we propose a unified
Perception-Language-Action (PLA) framework that integrates multi-sensor fusion
(cameras, LiDAR, radar) with a large language model (LLM)-augmented
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) architecture, specifically a GPT-4.1-powered
reasoning core. This framework unifies low-level sensory processing with
high-level contextual reasoning, tightly coupling perception with natural
language-based semantic understanding and decision-making to enable
context-aware, explainable, and safety-bounded autonomous driving. Evaluations
on an urban intersection scenario with a construction zone demonstrate superior
performance in trajectory tracking, speed prediction, and adaptive planning.
The results highlight the potential of language-augmented cognitive frameworks
for advancing the safety, interpretability, and scalability of autonomous
driving systems.

Motivation: 社会机器人需根据用户状态调整行为，准确评估用户体验（UX）是实现这一目标的关键。现有方法多关注单一维度，缺乏全面性。

Method: 构建UX数据集，开发基于Transformer的模型，结合面部表情和语音信号，利用多实例学习框架捕捉短期和长期交互模式。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在UX估计上优于第三方人工评估。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能更全面地捕捉用户体验的时空动态，为HRI中的适应性行为提供支持。

Abstract: In recent years, the demand for social robots has grown, requiring them to
adapt their behaviors based on users' states. Accurately assessing user
experience (UX) in human-robot interaction (HRI) is crucial for achieving this
adaptability. UX is a multi-faceted measure encompassing aspects such as
sentiment and engagement, yet existing methods often focus on these
individually. This study proposes a UX estimation method for HRI by leveraging
multimodal social signals. We construct a UX dataset and develop a
Transformer-based model that utilizes facial expressions and voice for
estimation. Unlike conventional models that rely on momentary observations, our
approach captures both short- and long-term interaction patterns using a
multi-instance learning framework. This enables the model to capture temporal
dynamics in UX, providing a more holistic representation. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms third-party human evaluators in UX
estimation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标签放置对地图设计的清晰性和可解释性至关重要，但现有自动化系统难以整合制图惯例或适应上下文。

Method: 将标签放置任务视为数据编辑问题，利用检索增强生成（RAG）获取相关标注指南，并通过指令调优的LLMs生成理想标签坐标。

Result: 在MAPLE数据集上评估了四种开源LLMs，结果显示LLMs在结构化提示和领域特定检索的引导下，能生成符合专家制图标准的标签。

Conclusion: 研究为AI辅助地图完成提供了可扩展框架，并展示了基础模型在结构化数据编辑任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Label placement is a critical aspect of map design, serving as a form of
spatial annotation that directly impacts clarity and interpretability. Despite
its importance, label placement remains largely manual and difficult to scale,
as existing automated systems struggle to integrate cartographic conventions,
adapt to context, or interpret labeling instructions. In this work, we
introduce a new paradigm for automatic label placement (ALP) that formulates
the task as a data editing problem and leverages large language models (LLMs)
for context-aware spatial annotation. To support this direction, we curate
MAPLE, the first known benchmarking dataset for evaluating ALP on real-world
maps, encompassing diverse landmark types and label placement annotations from
open-source data. Our method retrieves labeling guidelines relevant to each
landmark type leveraging retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), integrates them
into prompts, and employs instruction-tuned LLMs to generate ideal label
coordinates. We evaluate four open-source LLMs on MAPLE, analyzing both overall
performance and generalization across different types of landmarks. This
includes both zero-shot and instruction-tuned performance. Our results
demonstrate that LLMs, when guided by structured prompts and domain-specific
retrieval, can learn to perform accurate spatial edits, aligning the generated
outputs with expert cartographic standards. Overall, our work presents a
scalable framework for AI-assisted map finishing and demonstrates the potential
of foundation models in structured data editing tasks. The code and data can be

Abstract: Assessing the accessibility of unfamiliar built environments is critical for
people with disabilities. However, manual assessments, performed by users or
their personal health professionals, are laborious and unscalable, while
automatic machine learning methods often neglect an individual user's unique
needs. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) enable novel approaches
to this problem, balancing personalization with scalability to enable more
adaptive and context-aware assessments of accessibility. We present
Accessibility Scout, an LLM-based accessibility scanning system that identifies
accessibility concerns from photos of built environments. With use,
Accessibility Scout becomes an increasingly capable "accessibility scout",
tailoring accessibility scans to an individual's mobility level, preferences,
and specific environmental interests through collaborative Human-AI
assessments. We present findings from three studies: a formative study with six
participants to inform the design of Accessibility Scout, a technical
evaluation of 500 images of built environments, and a user study with 10
participants of varying mobility. Results from our technical evaluation and
user study show that Accessibility Scout can generate personalized
accessibility scans that extend beyond traditional ADA considerations. Finally,
we conclude with a discussion on the implications of our work and future steps
for building more scalable and personalized accessibility assessments of the
physical world.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于生成扩散模型的环境感知跨基站CKM推断方法BS-1-to-N，通过BS位置嵌入和注意力机制实现高效推断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在分布式节点架构中构建CKM成本高昂，而BS-1-to-N方法通过挖掘无线环境中的隐含相关性，实现高效推断。

Method: 设计了BS位置嵌入方法，并利用交叉和自注意力机制学习基站间关系，基于源基站CKM推断目标基站CKM。

Result: BS-1-to-N模型能够高效推断任意位置目标基站的CKM，优于基准方案。

Conclusion: 该方法为基站部署优化提供了实用工具，展现了环境感知通信的潜力。

Abstract: Channel knowledge map (CKM) inference across base stations (BSs) is the key
to achieving efficient environmentaware communications. This paper proposes an
environmentaware cross-BS CKM inference method called BS-1-to-N based on the
generative diffusion model. To this end, we first design the BS location
embedding (BSLE) method tailored for cross-BS CKM inference to embed BS
location information in the feature vector of CKM. Further, we utilize the
cross- and self-attention mechanism for the proposed BS-1-to-N model to
respectively learn the relationships between source and target BSs, as well as
that among target BSs. Therefore, given the locations of the source and target
BSs, together with the source CKMs as control conditions, cross-BS CKM
inference can be performed for an arbitrary number of source and target BSs.
Specifically, in architectures with massive distributed nodes like cell-free
networks, traditional methods of sequentially traversing each BS for CKM
construction are prohibitively costly. By contrast, the proposed BS-1-to-N
model is able to achieve efficient CKM inference for a target BS at any
potential location based on the CKMs of source BSs. This is achieved by
exploiting the fact that within a given area, different BSs share the same
wireless environment that leads to their respective CKMs. Therefore, similar to
multi-view synthesis, CKMs of different BSs are representations of the same
wireless environment from different BS locations. By mining the implicit
correlation between CKM and BS location based on the wireless environment, the
proposed BS-1-to-N method achieves efficient CKM inference across BSs. We
provide extensive comparisons of CKM inference between the proposed BS-1-to-N
generative model versus benchmarking schemes, and provide one use case study to
demonstrate its practical application for the optimization of BS deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究主要集中在主动检测恶意软件，而忽略了利用感染截图等反应性分析手段。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过LLM分析感染截图，提取URL、文件和感染主题，并关联数据以识别恶意活动和传播方法。

Result: 从1000张截图中提取了337个可操作URL和246个相关文件，识别了三种不同的恶意活动。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的分析为威胁情报提供了可扩展的方法，能够早期干预恶意活动。

Abstract: Infostealers exfiltrate credentials, session cookies, and sensitive data from
infected systems. With over 29 million stealer logs reported in 2024, manual
analysis and mitigation at scale are virtually unfeasible/unpractical. While
most research focuses on proactive malware detection, a significant gap remains
in leveraging reactive analysis of stealer logs and their associated artifacts.
Specifically, infection artifacts such as screenshots, image captured at the
point of compromise, are largely overlooked by the current literature. This
paper introduces a novel approach leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), more
specifically gpt-4o-mini, to analyze infection screenshots to extract potential
Indicators of Compromise (IoCs), map infection vectors, and track campaigns.
Focusing on the Aurora infostealer, we demonstrate how LLMs can process
screenshots to identify infection vectors, such as malicious URLs, installer
files, and exploited software themes. Our method extracted 337 actionable URLs
and 246 relevant files from 1000 screenshots, revealing key malware
distribution methods and social engineering tactics. By correlating extracted
filenames, URLs, and infection themes, we identified three distinct malware
campaigns, demonstrating the potential of LLM-driven analysis for uncovering
infection workflows and enhancing threat intelligence. By shifting malware
analysis from traditional log-based detection methods to a reactive,
artifact-driven approach that leverages infection screenshots, this research
presents a scalable method for identifying infection vectors and enabling early
intervention.

Result: 实验证明不同模型在充分性、对比性和完整性上表现不同，算法高效且完全黑盒。

Conclusion: 因果解释兼具形式化严谨性和实用性，适用于图像分类器。

Abstract: Existing algorithms for explaining the outputs of image classifiers are based
on a variety of approaches and produce explanations that lack formal rigor. On
the other hand, logic-based explanations are formally and rigorously defined
but their computability relies on strict assumptions about the model that do
not hold on image classifiers.
  In this paper, we show that causal explanations, in addition to being
formally and rigorously defined, enjoy the same formal properties as
logic-based ones, while still lending themselves to black-box algorithms and
being a natural fit for image classifiers. We prove formal properties of causal
explanations and introduce contrastive causal explanations for image
classifiers. Moreover, we augment the definition of explanation with confidence
awareness and introduce complete causal explanations: explanations that are
classified with exactly the same confidence as the original image.
  We implement our definitions, and our experimental results demonstrate that
different models have different patterns of sufficiency, contrastiveness, and
completeness. Our algorithms are efficiently computable, taking on average 6s
per image on a ResNet50 model to compute all types of explanations, and are
totally black-box, needing no knowledge of the model, no access to model
internals, no access to gradient, nor requiring any properties, such as
monotonicity, of the model.

Result: 模型在多种材料和任务中表现优异，泛化能力强，数据需求低。

Conclusion: 统一断裂预测模型架构，提供可扩展的替代方案。

Abstract: Accurately predicting when and how materials fail is critical to designing
safe, reliable structures, mechanical systems, and engineered components that
operate under stress. Yet, fracture behavior remains difficult to model across
the diversity of materials, geometries, and loading conditions in real-world
applications. While machine learning (ML) methods show promise, most models are
trained on narrow datasets, lack robustness, and struggle to generalize.
Meanwhile, physics-based simulators offer high-fidelity predictions but are
fragmented across specialized methods and require substantial high-performance
computing resources to explore the input space. To address these limitations,
we present a data-driven foundation model for fracture prediction, a
transformer-based architecture that operates across simulators, a wide range of
materials (including plastic-bonded explosives, steel, aluminum, shale, and
tungsten), and diverse loading conditions. The model supports both structured
and unstructured meshes, combining them with large language model embeddings of
textual input decks specifying material properties, boundary conditions, and
solver settings. This multimodal input design enables flexible adaptation
across simulation scenarios without changes to the model architecture. The
trained model can be fine-tuned with minimal data on diverse downstream tasks,
including time-to-failure estimation, modeling fracture evolution, and adapting
to combined finite-discrete element method simulations. It also generalizes to
unseen materials such as titanium and concrete, requiring as few as a single
sample, dramatically reducing data needs compared to standard ML. Our results
show that fracture prediction can be unified under a single model architecture,
offering a scalable, extensible alternative to simulator-specific workflows.

Conclusion: NeuroAR能够高保真地模拟个体特异性脑老化轨迹，显著优于其他关键模型。

Abstract: Brain aging synthesis is a critical task with broad applications in clinical
and computational neuroscience. The ability to predict the future structural
evolution of a subject's brain from an earlier MRI scan provides valuable
insights into aging trajectories. Yet, the high-dimensionality of data, subtle
changes of structure across ages, and subject-specific patterns constitute
challenges in the synthesis of the aging brain. To overcome these challenges,
we propose NeuroAR, a novel brain aging simulation model based on generative
autoregressive transformers. NeuroAR synthesizes the aging brain by
autoregressively estimating the discrete token maps of a future scan from a
convenient space of concatenated token embeddings of a previous and future
scan. To guide the generation, it concatenates into each scale the subject's
previous scan, and uses its acquisition age and the target age at each block
via cross-attention. We evaluate our approach on both the elderly population
and adolescent subjects, demonstrating superior performance over
state-of-the-art generative models, including latent diffusion models (LDM) and
generative adversarial networks, in terms of image fidelity. Furthermore, we
employ a pre-trained age predictor to further validate the consistency and
realism of the synthesized images with respect to expected aging patterns.
NeuroAR significantly outperforms key models, including LDM, demonstrating its
ability to model subject-specific brain aging trajectories with high fidelity.

*Shengao Yi,Xiaojiang Li,Wei Tu,Tianhong Zhao*

TL;DR: GSM-UTCI是一种多模态深度学习框架，用于预测城市尺度的热应力，具有高精度和高效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市因气候变化和城市化面临极端热事件加剧的挑战，传统物理模型计算成本高，难以扩展。

Method: 提出GSM-UTCI框架，融合地表形态、土地覆盖数据和气象条件，使用FiLM架构动态调整空间特征。

Result: 模型在R2和MAE上表现优异，计算时间大幅缩短，应用于费城绿化策略模拟显示显著降温效果。

Conclusion: GSM-UTCI为城市气候适应提供了可扩展的精细决策工具，支持多样化绿化策略评估。

Abstract: As extreme heat events intensify due to climate change and urbanization,
cities face increasing challenges in mitigating outdoor heat stress. While
traditional physical models such as SOLWEIG and ENVI-met provide detailed
assessments of human-perceived heat exposure, their computational demands limit
scalability for city-wide planning. In this study, we propose GSM-UTCI, a
multimodal deep learning framework designed to predict daytime average
Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) at 1-meter hyperlocal resolution. The
model fuses surface morphology (nDSM), high-resolution land cover data, and
hourly meteorological conditions using a feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM)
architecture that dynamically conditions spatial features on atmospheric
context. Trained on SOLWEIG-derived UTCI maps, GSM-UTCI achieves near-physical
accuracy, with an R2 of 0.9151 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.41{\deg}C,
while reducing inference time from hours to under five minutes for an entire
city. To demonstrate its planning relevance, we apply GSM-UTCI to simulate
systematic landscape transformation scenarios in Philadelphia, replacing bare
earth, grass, and impervious surfaces with tree canopy. Results show spatially
heterogeneous but consistently strong cooling effects, with impervious-to-tree
conversion producing the highest aggregated benefit (-4.18{\deg}C average
change in UTCI across 270.7 km2). Tract-level bivariate analysis further
reveals strong alignment between thermal reduction potential and land cover
proportions. These findings underscore the utility of GSM-UTCI as a scalable,
fine-grained decision support tool for urban climate adaptation, enabling
scenario-based evaluation of greening strategies across diverse urban
environments.

Motivation: 探索多模态潜在空间在逆向任务中的潜力，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 提出基于优化的框架，应用于文本-图像和文本-音频模态的双向推断。

Result: 实验表明，逆向映射的感知质量混乱且语义不可解释。

Conclusion: 多模态潜在空间缺乏稳健且可解释的逆向结构，需进一步研究。

Abstract: This paper investigates the inverse capabilities and broader utility of
multimodal latent spaces within task-specific AI (Artificial Intelligence)
models. While these models excel at their designed forward tasks (e.g.,
text-to-image generation, audio-to-text transcription), their potential for
inverse mappings remains largely unexplored. We propose an optimization-based
framework to infer input characteristics from desired outputs, applying it
bidirectionally across Text-Image (BLIP, Flux.1-dev) and Text-Audio
(Whisper-Large-V3, Chatterbox-TTS) modalities.
  Our central hypothesis posits that while optimization can guide models
towards inverse tasks, their multimodal latent spaces will not consistently
support semantically meaningful and perceptually coherent inverse mappings.
Experimental results consistently validate this hypothesis. We demonstrate that
while optimization can force models to produce outputs that align textually
with targets (e.g., a text-to-image model generating an image that an image
captioning model describes correctly, or an ASR model transcribing optimized
audio accurately), the perceptual quality of these inversions is chaotic and
incoherent. Furthermore, when attempting to infer the original semantic input
from generative models, the reconstructed latent space embeddings frequently
lack semantic interpretability, aligning with nonsensical vocabulary tokens.
  These findings highlight a critical limitation. multimodal latent spaces,
primarily optimized for specific forward tasks, do not inherently possess the
structure required for robust and interpretable inverse mappings. Our work
underscores the need for further research into developing truly semantically
rich and invertible multimodal latent spaces.

TL;DR: FuseTen是一种生成框架，通过融合Sentinel-2、Landsat 8和Terra MODIS的数据，生成10米空间分辨率的每日地表温度（LST）观测数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决卫星数据在空间和时间分辨率之间的权衡问题，以更准确地研究城市热浪、干旱和土地退化等问题。

Method: 使用生成架构，结合注意力机制和归一化模块，采用基于物理原理的监督策略，并利用PatchGAN判别器增强真实性。

Result: 实验表明，FuseTen在定量指标上平均提升32.06%，视觉保真度提升31.42%，优于线性基线方法。

Conclusion: FuseTen是首个能够在如此精细空间分辨率下生成每日LST估计的非线性方法。

Abstract: Urban heatwaves, droughts, and land degradation are pressing and growing
challenges in the context of climate change. A valuable approach to studying
them requires accurate spatio-temporal information on land surface conditions.
One of the most important variables for assessing and understanding these
phenomena is Land Surface Temperature (LST), which is derived from satellites
and provides essential information about the thermal state of the Earth's
surface. However, satellite platforms inherently face a trade-off between
spatial and temporal resolutions. To bridge this gap, we propose FuseTen, a
novel generative framework that produces daily LST observations at a fine 10 m
spatial resolution by fusing spatio-temporal observations derived from
Sentinel-2, Landsat 8, and Terra MODIS. FuseTen employs a generative
architecture trained using an averaging-based supervision strategy grounded in
physical principles. It incorporates attention and normalization modules within
the fusion process and uses a PatchGAN discriminator to enforce realism.
Experiments across multiple dates show that FuseTen outperforms linear
baselines, with an average 32.06% improvement in quantitative metrics and
31.42% in visual fidelity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
non-linear method to generate daily LST estimates at such fine spatial
resolution.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Experience Blending的新方法，通过结合存储的关键样本和合成的边界数据（SBD）来缓解持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续学习（CL）中，灾难性遗忘是一个主要挑战。尽管经验回放（experience replay）有一定效果，但其稀疏分布的关键样本限制了决策边界的稳定性。因此，研究希望通过引入合成的边界数据（SBD）来改善这一问题。

Method: 提出了Experience Blending框架，包含两个核心组件：(1) 多变量差分隐私（DP）噪声机制，用于生成SBD；(2) 结合存储关键样本和SBD的端到端训练策略。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和Tiny ImageNet上的实验表明，该方法优于9种基线方法，准确率分别提高了10%、6%和13%。

Conclusion: 通过引入合成的边界数据（SBD）并结合存储的关键样本，Experience Blending有效缓解了灾难性遗忘，显著提升了持续学习模型的性能。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to address catastrophic forgetting in models
trained sequentially on multiple tasks. While experience replay has shown
promise, its effectiveness is often limited by the sparse distribution of
stored key samples, leading to overly simplified decision boundaries. We
hypothesize that introducing synthetic data near the decision boundary
(Synthetic Boundary Data, or SBD) during training serves as an implicit
regularizer, improving boundary stability and mitigating forgetting. To
validate this hypothesis, we propose a novel training framework, {\bf
Experience Blending}, which integrates knowledge from both stored key samples
and synthetic, boundary-adjacent data. Experience blending consists of two core
components: (1) a multivariate Differential Privacy (DP) noise mechanism that
injects batch-wise noise into low-dimensional feature representations,
generating SBD; and (2) an end-to-end training strategy that jointly leverages
both stored key samples and SBD. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
and Tiny ImageNet demonstrate that our method outperforms nine CL baselines,
achieving accuracy improvements of 10%, 6%, and 13%, respectively.

TL;DR: DepMicroDiff是一种结合扩散模型和依赖感知Transformer的新方法，用于微生物组数据插补，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微生物组数据的稀疏性和噪声对准确插补构成挑战，现有方法未能充分捕捉微生物间的复杂依赖关系或利用上下文元数据。

Method: DepMicroDiff结合扩散生成模型和依赖感知Transformer，通过VAE预训练和LLM编码患者元数据增强。

Result: 在TCGA数据集上，DepMicroDiff在Pearson相关性、余弦相似性和误差指标上显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: DepMicroDiff在微生物组数据插补中表现出鲁棒性和泛化能力，为下游任务提供了更准确的数据支持。

Abstract: Microbiome data analysis is essential for understanding host health and
disease, yet its inherent sparsity and noise pose major challenges for accurate
imputation, hindering downstream tasks such as biomarker discovery. Existing
imputation methods, including recent diffusion-based models, often fail to
capture the complex interdependencies between microbial taxa and overlook
contextual metadata that can inform imputation. We introduce DepMicroDiff, a
novel framework that combines diffusion-based generative modeling with a
Dependency-Aware Transformer (DAT) to explicitly capture both mutual pairwise
dependencies and autoregressive relationships. DepMicroDiff is further enhanced
by VAE-based pretraining across diverse cancer datasets and conditioning on
patient metadata encoded via a large language model (LLM). Experiments on TCGA
microbiome datasets show that DepMicroDiff substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher Pearson correlation (up to 0.712),
cosine similarity (up to 0.812), and lower RMSE and MAE across multiple cancer
types, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability for microbiome
imputation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型选择需要大量标注验证数据，成本高且耗时。CODA旨在通过主动学习减少标注需求。

Conclusion: CODA是一种高效的主动模型选择方法，能大幅降低标注成本并快速找到最佳模型。

Abstract: The widespread availability of off-the-shelf machine learning models poses a
challenge: which model, of the many available candidates, should be chosen for
a given data analysis task? This question of model selection is traditionally
answered by collecting and annotating a validation dataset -- a costly and
time-intensive process. We propose a method for active model selection, using
predictions from candidate models to prioritize the labeling of test data
points that efficiently differentiate the best candidate. Our method, CODA,
performs consensus-driven active model selection by modeling relationships
between classifiers, categories, and data points within a probabilistic
framework. The framework uses the consensus and disagreement between models in
the candidate pool to guide the label acquisition process, and Bayesian
inference to update beliefs about which model is best as more information is
collected. We validate our approach by curating a collection of 26 benchmark
tasks capturing a range of model selection scenarios. CODA outperforms existing
methods for active model selection significantly, reducing the annotation
effort required to discover the best model by upwards of 70% compared to the
previous state-of-the-art. Code and data are available at
https://github.com/justinkay/coda.
