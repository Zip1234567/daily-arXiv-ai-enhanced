### [1] [Runtime Failure Hunting for Physics Engine Based Software Systems: How Far Can We Go?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22099)
*Shuqing Li,Qiang Chen,Xiaoxue Ren,Michael R. Lyu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文首次大规模实证研究物理引擎（PE）中的物理故障，提出分类法、评估检测方法并提供开发者见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物理引擎的物理故障可能影响软件可靠性和用户体验，现有测试方法不足。

Method: 研究通过三个研究问题分析物理故障表现、检测技术效果及开发者对检测实践的看法。

Result: 提出物理故障分类法，评估深度学习和多模态模型等检测方法，并分享开发者反馈。

Conclusion: 研究为改进物理故障检测提供基础，并发布PhysiXFails支持未来研究。

Abstract: Physics Engines (PEs) are fundamental software frameworks that simulate
physical interactions in applications ranging from entertainment to
safety-critical systems. Despite their importance, PEs suffer from physics
failures, deviations from expected physical behaviors that can compromise
software reliability, degrade user experience, and potentially cause critical
failures in autonomous vehicles or medical robotics. Current testing approaches
for PE-based software are inadequate, typically requiring white-box access and
focusing on crash detection rather than semantically complex physics failures.
This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study characterizing
physics failures in PE-based software. We investigate three research questions
addressing the manifestations of physics failures, the effectiveness of
detection techniques, and developer perceptions of current detection practices.
Our contributions include: (1) a taxonomy of physics failure manifestations;
(2) a comprehensive evaluation of detection methods including deep learning,
prompt-based techniques, and large multimodal models; and (3) actionable
insights from developer experiences for improving detection approaches. To
support future research, we release PhysiXFails, code, and other materials at
https://sites.google.com/view/physics-failure-detection.

TL;DR: TRIG-Bench是一个多维度评估图像生成模型性能的数据集和工具，涵盖10个维度，并提出TRIGScore和DTM方法以分析模型间的权衡关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究缺乏对图像生成模型在多维度（如质量、对齐、多样性等）间复杂权衡的深入探索，主要由于数据集和评估方法的不足。

Method: 引入TRIG-Bench数据集和TRIGScore评估指标，开发Relation Recognition System生成Dimension Trade-off Map（DTM），分析14个模型的性能权衡。

Result: 实验表明DTM能全面展示模型在不同维度间的权衡关系，并通过微调提升模型性能。

Conclusion: TRIG-Bench和DTM为图像生成模型的性能评估和改进提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Model performance in text-to-image (T2I) and image-to-image (I2I) generation
often depends on multiple aspects, including quality, alignment, diversity, and
robustness. However, models' complex trade-offs among these dimensions have
rarely been explored due to (1) the lack of datasets that allow fine-grained
quantification of these trade-offs, and (2) the use of a single metric for
multiple dimensions. To bridge this gap, we introduce TRIG-Bench (Trade-offs in
Image Generation), which spans 10 dimensions (Realism, Originality, Aesthetics,
Content, Relation, Style, Knowledge, Ambiguity, Toxicity, and Bias), contains
40,200 samples, and covers 132 pairwise dimensional subsets. Furthermore, we
develop TRIGScore, a VLM-as-judge metric that automatically adapts to various
dimensions. Based on TRIG-Bench and TRIGScore, we evaluate 14 models across T2I
and I2I tasks. In addition, we propose the Relation Recognition System to
generate the Dimension Trade-off Map (DTM) that visualizes the trade-offs among
model-specific capabilities. Our experiments demonstrate that DTM consistently
provides a comprehensive understanding of the trade-offs between dimensions for
each type of generative model. Notably, we show that the model's
dimension-specific weaknesses can be mitigated through fine-tuning on DTM to
enhance overall performance. Code is available at:

Abstract: Crops, fisheries and livestock form the backbone of global food production,
essential to feed the ever-growing global population. However, these sectors
face considerable challenges, including climate variability, resource
limitations, and the need for sustainable management. Addressing these issues
requires efficient, accurate, and scalable technological solutions,
highlighting the importance of artificial intelligence (AI). This survey
presents a systematic and thorough review of more than 200 research works
covering conventional machine learning approaches, advanced deep learning
techniques (e.g., vision transformers), and recent vision-language foundation
models (e.g., CLIP) in the agriculture domain, focusing on diverse tasks such
as crop disease detection, livestock health management, and aquatic species
monitoring. We further cover major implementation challenges such as data
variability and experimental aspects: datasets, performance evaluation metrics,
and geographical focus. We finish the survey by discussing potential open
research directions emphasizing the need for multimodal data integration,
efficient edge-device deployment, and domain-adaptable AI models for diverse
farming environments. Rapid growth of evolving developments in this field can

### [4] [Color as the Impetus: Transforming Few-Shot Learner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22136)
*Chaofei Qi,Zhitai Liu,Jianbin Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种受人类颜色感知启发的元学习框架ColorSense Learner，通过颜色通道交互和知识蒸馏提升少样本分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类颜色感知能力对元学习有启发作用，但传统方法忽视了颜色信息的重要性。

Method: 提出ColorSense Learner框架，利用颜色通道特征提取和交互学习，并结合知识蒸馏的ColorSense Distiller。

Result: 在11个少样本基准测试中表现出强大的泛化能力、鲁棒性和迁移性。

Conclusion: 通过模拟人类颜色感知机制，显著提升了少样本分类的性能。

Abstract: Humans possess innate meta-learning capabilities, partly attributable to
their exceptional color perception. In this paper, we pioneer an innovative
viewpoint on few-shot learning by simulating human color perception mechanisms.
We propose the ColorSense Learner, a bio-inspired meta-learning framework that
capitalizes on inter-channel feature extraction and interactive learning. By
strategically emphasizing distinct color information across different channels,
our approach effectively filters irrelevant features while capturing
discriminative characteristics. Color information represents the most intuitive
visual feature, yet conventional meta-learning methods have predominantly
neglected this aspect, focusing instead on abstract feature differentiation
across categories. Our framework bridges the gap via synergistic color-channel
interactions, enabling better intra-class commonality extraction and larger
inter-class differences. Furthermore, we introduce a meta-distiller based on
knowledge distillation, ColorSense Distiller, which incorporates prior teacher
knowledge to augment the student network's meta-learning capacity. We've
conducted comprehensive coarse/fine-grained and cross-domain experiments on
eleven few-shot benchmarks for validation. Numerous experiments reveal that our
methods have extremely strong generalization ability, robustness, and
transferability, and effortless handle few-shot classification from the
perspective of color perception.

### [5] [Enhancing efficiency in paediatric brain tumour segmentation using a pathologically diverse single-center clinical dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22152)
*A. Piffer,J. A. Buchner,A. G. Gennari,P. Grehten,S. Sirin,E. Ross,I. Ezhov,M. Rosier,J. C. Peeken,M. Piraud,B. Menze,A. Guerreiro Stücklin,A. Jakab,F. Kofler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DL-based segmentation for paediatric brain tumours shows promise for whole tumour and T2-hyperintensity delineation, with challenges in enhancing tumour and cystic component segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address diagnostic and therapeutic challenges in diverse paediatric brain tumours by evaluating DL-based segmentation performance across heterogeneous subtypes and MRI protocols.

Method: Used a 3D nnU-Net model on a retrospective cohort of 174 patients with various PBTs, assessing segmentation performance via Dice similarity coefficient compared to human variability.

Result: Model achieved robust performance for whole tumour and T2-hyperintensity (DSC ~0.85), comparable to human annotators, but struggled with enhancing tumour (DSC ~0.75) and cystic component.

Conclusion: DL is feasible for PBT segmentation, supporting protocol simplification and workflow automation, though further refinement is needed for certain tumour subregions.

Abstract: Background Brain tumours are the most common solid malignancies in children,
encompassing diverse histological, molecular subtypes and imaging features and
outcomes. Paediatric brain tumours (PBTs), including high- and low-grade
gliomas (HGG, LGG), medulloblastomas (MB), ependymomas, and rarer forms, pose
diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Deep learning (DL)-based segmentation
offers promising tools for tumour delineation, yet its performance across
heterogeneous PBT subtypes and MRI protocols remains uncertain. Methods A
retrospective single-centre cohort of 174 paediatric patients with HGG, LGG,
medulloblastomas (MB), ependymomas, and other rarer subtypes was used. MRI
sequences included T1, T1 post-contrast (T1-C), T2, and FLAIR. Manual
annotations were provided for four tumour subregions: whole tumour (WT),
T2-hyperintensity (T2H), enhancing tumour (ET), and cystic component (CC). A 3D
nnU-Net model was trained and tested (121/53 split), with segmentation
performance assessed using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and compared
against intra- and inter-rater variability. Results The model achieved robust
performance for WT and T2H (mean DSC: 0.85), comparable to human annotator
variability (mean DSC: 0.86). ET segmentation was moderately accurate (mean
DSC: 0.75), while CC performance was poor. Segmentation accuracy varied by
tumour type, MRI sequence combination, and location. Notably, T1, T1-C, and T2
alone produced results nearly equivalent to the full protocol. Conclusions DL
is feasible for PBTs, particularly for T2H and WT. Challenges remain for ET and
CC segmentation, highlighting the need for further refinement. These findings
support the potential for protocol simplification and automation to enhance
volumetric assessment and streamline paediatric neuro-oncology workflows.

### [6] [Temporally Consistent Unsupervised Segmentation for Mobile Robot Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22194)
*Christian Ellis,Maggie Wigness,Craig Lennon,Lance Fiondella*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Frontier-Seg的方法，用于在无监督条件下从移动机器人视频流中实现时间一致的语义分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖昂贵的数据标注，且在未预演的无结构环境中表现不佳，缺乏时间一致性。

Method: 利用DINOv2提取超像素级特征，并通过聚类和时间一致性约束识别地形边界。

Result: 在RUGD和RELLIS-3D等数据集上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: Frontier-Seg在无监督条件下实现了时间一致的语义分割，适用于无结构环境。

Abstract: Rapid progress in terrain-aware autonomous ground navigation has been driven
by advances in supervised semantic segmentation. However, these methods rely on
costly data collection and labor-intensive ground truth labeling to train deep
models. Furthermore, autonomous systems are increasingly deployed in
unrehearsed, unstructured environments where no labeled data exists and
semantic categories may be ambiguous or domain-specific. Recent zero-shot
approaches to unsupervised segmentation have shown promise in such settings but
typically operate on individual frames, lacking temporal consistency-a critical
property for robust perception in unstructured environments. To address this
gap we introduce Frontier-Seg, a method for temporally consistent unsupervised
segmentation of terrain from mobile robot video streams. Frontier-Seg clusters
superpixel-level features extracted from foundation model
backbones-specifically DINOv2-and enforces temporal consistency across frames
to identify persistent terrain boundaries or frontiers without human
supervision. We evaluate Frontier-Seg on a diverse set of benchmark
datasets-including RUGD and RELLIS-3D-demonstrating its ability to perform
unsupervised segmentation across unstructured off-road environments.

### [7] [SmartCLIP: Modular Vision-language Alignment with Identification Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22264)
*Shaoan Xie,Lingjing Kong,Yujia Zheng,Yu Yao,Zeyu Tang,Eric P. Xing,Guangyi Chen,Kun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SmartCLIP的新方法，解决了CLIP模型在图像-文本对齐中的信息错位和表示纠缠问题，通过模块化方式实现多粒度对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP模型在图像-文本对齐中存在信息错位和表示纠缠问题，限制了其在短提示下游任务中的泛化能力。

Method: 提出理论条件，支持多粒度文本-视觉表示对齐，并引入SmartCLIP方法，模块化对齐最相关的视觉和文本表示。

Result: SmartCLIP在多种任务中表现优异，验证了其处理信息错位的能力。

Conclusion: SmartCLIP通过模块化对齐解决了CLIP的局限性，提升了多粒度对齐能力。

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)~\citep{radford2021learning}
has emerged as a pivotal model in computer vision and multimodal learning,
achieving state-of-the-art performance at aligning visual and textual
representations through contrastive learning. However, CLIP struggles with
potential information misalignment in many image-text datasets and suffers from
entangled representation. On the one hand, short captions for a single image in
datasets like MSCOCO may describe disjoint regions in the image, leaving the
model uncertain about which visual features to retain or disregard. On the
other hand, directly aligning long captions with images can lead to the
retention of entangled details, preventing the model from learning
disentangled, atomic concepts -- ultimately limiting its generalization on
certain downstream tasks involving short prompts.
  In this paper, we establish theoretical conditions that enable flexible
alignment between textual and visual representations across varying levels of
granularity. Specifically, our framework ensures that a model can not only
\emph{preserve} cross-modal semantic information in its entirety but also
\emph{disentangle} visual representations to capture fine-grained textual
concepts. Building on this foundation, we introduce \ours, a novel approach
that identifies and aligns the most relevant visual and textual representations
in a modular manner. Superior performance across various tasks demonstrates its
capability to handle information misalignment and supports our identification
theory. The code is available at https://github.com/Mid-Push/SmartCLIP.

### [8] [HOG-CNN: Integrating Histogram of Oriented Gradients with Convolutional Neural Networks for Retinal Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22274)
*Faisal Ahmed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于HOG-CNN的自动临床决策支持框架，用于视网膜疾病的早期检测，结合手工特征与深度学习，在多个数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视网膜疾病诊断依赖人工，耗时耗力，需自动化且可解释的解决方案。

Method: 融合HOG手工特征与CNN深度特征，构建HOG-CNN模型。

Result: 在APTOS 2019、ORIGA和IC-AMD数据集上表现优异，如DR分类准确率98.5%，AMD诊断准确率92.8%。

Conclusion: HOG-CNN是一种轻量级、可解释且高效的视网膜疾病筛查工具。

Abstract: The analysis of fundus images is critical for the early detection and
diagnosis of retinal diseases such as Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), Glaucoma, and
Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD). Traditional diagnostic workflows,
however, often depend on manual interpretation and are both time- and
resource-intensive. To address these limitations, we propose an automated and
interpretable clinical decision support framework based on a hybrid feature
extraction model called HOG-CNN. Our key contribution lies in the integration
of handcrafted Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features with deep
convolutional neural network (CNN) representations. This fusion enables our
model to capture both local texture patterns and high-level semantic features
from retinal fundus images. We evaluated our model on three public benchmark
datasets: APTOS 2019 (for binary and multiclass DR classification), ORIGA (for
Glaucoma detection), and IC-AMD (for AMD diagnosis); HOG-CNN demonstrates
consistently high performance. It achieves 98.5\% accuracy and 99.2 AUC for
binary DR classification, and 94.2 AUC for five-class DR classification. On the
IC-AMD dataset, it attains 92.8\% accuracy, 94.8\% precision, and 94.5 AUC,
outperforming several state-of-the-art models. For Glaucoma detection on ORIGA,
our model achieves 83.9\% accuracy and 87.2 AUC, showing competitive
performance despite dataset limitations. We show, through comprehensive
appendix studies, the complementary strength of combining HOG and CNN features.
The model's lightweight and interpretable design makes it particularly suitable
for deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments. These results
position HOG-CNN as a robust and scalable tool for automated retinal disease
screening.

TL;DR: AlphaEarth Foundations提出了一种通用的地理空间表示模型，能够高效生成高质量地图和监测系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地球观测数据量大但高质量标签稀缺，需要一种通用模型来提升地图生成效率。

Method: 采用嵌入场模型，整合空间、时间和测量上下文的多源数据。

Result: 生成的嵌入在所有测试中均优于现有特征化方法，无需重新训练。

Conclusion: AlphaEarth Foundations为全球地图和监测系统提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Unprecedented volumes of Earth observation data are continually collected
around the world, but high-quality labels remain scarce given the effort
required to make physical measurements and observations. This has led to
considerable investment in bespoke modeling efforts translating sparse labels
into maps. Here we introduce AlphaEarth Foundations, an embedding field model
yielding a highly general, geospatial representation that assimilates spatial,
temporal, and measurement contexts across multiple sources, enabling accurate
and efficient production of maps and monitoring systems from local to global
scales. The embeddings generated by AlphaEarth Foundations are the only to
consistently outperform all previous featurization approaches tested on a
diverse set of mapping evaluations without re-training. We will release a
dataset of global, annual, analysis-ready embedding field layers from 2017
through 2024.

*Chi Ding,Qingchao Zhang,Ge Wang,Xiaojing Ye,Yunmei Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种可学习的变分模型（LAMA），用于图像重建，结合了图像和测量域的特征，并通过收敛性证明和实验验证了其稳定性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图像重建中非凸非光滑优化问题，同时提供收敛性证明和提升网络性能。

Method: 引入学习交替最小化算法（LAMA），结合残差学习和近端交替框架，并扩展为LAMA-Net/iLAMA-Net。

Result: LAMA-Net表现出优异的稳定性和鲁棒性，iLAMA-Net进一步提升了性能。

Conclusion: LAMA及其衍生网络在稀疏视图CT重建中优于现有方法，具有理论和实践价值。

Abstract: We propose a learnable variational model that learns the features and
leverages complementary information from both image and measurement domains for
image reconstruction. In particular, we introduce a learned alternating
minimization algorithm (LAMA) from our prior work, which tackles two-block
nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization problems by incorporating a residual
learning architecture in a proximal alternating framework. In this work, our
goal is to provide a complete and rigorous convergence proof of LAMA and show
that all accumulation points of a specified subsequence of LAMA must be Clarke
stationary points of the problem. LAMA directly yields a highly interpretable
neural network architecture called LAMA-Net. Notably, in addition to the
results shown in our prior work, we demonstrate that the convergence property
of LAMA yields outstanding stability and robustness of LAMA-Net in this work.
We also show that the performance of LAMA-Net can be further improved by
integrating a properly designed network that generates suitable initials, which
we call iLAMA-Net. To evaluate LAMA-Net/iLAMA-Net, we conduct several
experiments and compare them with several state-of-the-art methods on popular
benchmark datasets for Sparse-View Computed Tomography.

*Yuzhen Gao,Qianqian Wang,Yongheng Sun,Cui Wang,Yongquan Liang,Mingxia Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种协作域适应（CDA）框架，结合Vision Transformer和CNN，用于通过T1加权MRI检测晚年抑郁症（LLD），解决了样本量小和域异质性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 晚年抑郁症（LLD）的准确识别对疾病监测和干预至关重要，但现有方法受限于小样本量和域异质性。

Method: CDA框架分三阶段：源数据监督训练、目标特征自监督适应和协作训练。结合ViT和CNN，通过最小化分类器差异和增强数据一致性提升泛化能力。

Result: 在多站点T1加权MRI数据上的实验表明，CDA优于现有无监督域适应方法。

Conclusion: CDA框架有效解决了LLD检测中的小样本和域适应问题，具有更好的泛化性能。

Abstract: Accurate identification of late-life depression (LLD) using structural brain
MRI is essential for monitoring disease progression and facilitating timely
intervention. However, existing learning-based approaches for LLD detection are
often constrained by limited sample sizes (e.g., tens), which poses significant
challenges for reliable model training and generalization. Although
incorporating auxiliary datasets can expand the training set, substantial
domain heterogeneity, such as differences in imaging protocols, scanner
hardware, and population demographics, often undermines cross-domain
transferability. To address this issue, we propose a Collaborative Domain
Adaptation (CDA) framework for LLD detection using T1-weighted MRIs. The CDA
leverages a Vision Transformer (ViT) to capture global anatomical context and a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract local structural features, with
each branch comprising an encoder and a classifier. The CDA framework consists
of three stages: (a) supervised training on labeled source data, (b)
self-supervised target feature adaptation and (c) collaborative training on
unlabeled target data. We first train ViT and CNN on source data, followed by
self-supervised target feature adaptation by minimizing the discrepancy between
classifier outputs from two branches to make the categorical boundary clearer.
The collaborative training stage employs pseudo-labeled and augmented
target-domain MRIs, enforcing prediction consistency under strong and weak
augmentation to enhance domain robustness and generalization. Extensive
experiments conducted on multi-site T1-weighted MRI data demonstrate that the
CDA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation
methods.

*Yuki Fujimura,Takahiro Kushida,Kazuya Kitano,Takuya Funatomi,Yasuhiro Mukaigawa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需姿态信息的3D高斯泼溅框架，用于处理不利视角输入，通过低秩适应层和几何一致性增强模块提升模型适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖有利视角训练，限制了在未知相机姿态场景中的应用。

Method: 结合低秩适应层（LoRA）和高斯适配模块，利用有利图像训练模型处理不利视角。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了模型在不利视角下的表现，扩展了应用范围。

Abstract: This paper presents a pose-free, feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
framework designed to handle unfavorable input views. A common rendering setup
for training feed-forward approaches places a 3D object at the world origin and
renders it from cameras pointed toward the origin -- i.e., from favorable
views, limiting the applicability of these models to real-world scenarios
involving varying and unknown camera poses. To overcome this limitation, we
introduce a novel adaptation framework that enables pretrained pose-free
feed-forward 3DGS models to handle unfavorable views. We leverage priors
learned from favorable images by feeding recentered images into a pretrained
model augmented with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) layers. We further propose a
Gaussian adapter module to enhance the geometric consistency of the Gaussians
derived from the recentered inputs, along with a Gaussian alignment method to
render accurate target views for training. Additionally, we introduce a new
training strategy that utilizes an off-the-shelf dataset composed solely of
favorable images. Experimental results on both synthetic images from the Google
Scanned Objects dataset and real images from the OmniObject3D dataset validate
the effectiveness of our method in handling unfavorable input views.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合变化检测和视觉问答的新范式RSICA，并构建了大规模数据集ChangeChat-105k，开发了DeltaVLM模型，用于交互式遥感图像变化分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅提供一次性变化掩码或静态描述，无法支持交互式查询驱动分析。

Method: 提出了DeltaVLM模型，包括优化的双时相视觉编码器、视觉差异感知模块和指令引导的Q-former。

Result: DeltaVLM在单轮描述和多轮交互变化分析中表现最优。

Conclusion: DeltaVLM为遥感图像变化分析提供了高效、交互式的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of land-cover changes in multi-temporal satellite
imagery is critical for real-world scenarios. However, existing methods
typically provide only one-shot change masks or static captions, limiting their
ability to support interactive, query-driven analysis. In this work, we
introduce remote sensing image change analysis (RSICA) as a new paradigm that
combines the strengths of change detection and visual question answering to
enable multi-turn, instruction-guided exploration of changes in bi-temporal
remote sensing images. To support this task, we construct ChangeChat-105k, a
large-scale instruction-following dataset, generated through a hybrid
rule-based and GPT-assisted process, covering six interaction types: change
captioning, classification, quantification, localization, open-ended question
answering, and multi-turn dialogues. Building on this dataset, we propose
DeltaVLM, an end-to-end architecture tailored for interactive RSICA. DeltaVLM
features three innovations: (1) a fine-tuned bi-temporal vision encoder to
capture temporal differences; (2) a visual difference perception module with a
cross-semantic relation measuring (CSRM) mechanism to interpret changes; and
(3) an instruction-guided Q-former to effectively extract query-relevant
difference information from visual changes, aligning them with textual
instructions. We train DeltaVLM on ChangeChat-105k using a frozen large
language model, adapting only the vision and alignment modules to optimize
efficiency. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that
DeltaVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on both single-turn captioning
and multi-turn interactive change analysis, outperforming existing multimodal
large language models and remote sensing vision-language models. Code, dataset
and pre-trained weights are available at https://github.com/hanlinwu/DeltaVLM.

introduces generalized face discovery (GFD), a novel open-world face
recognition task that unifies traditional face identification with generalized
category discovery (GCD). GFD requires recognizing both labeled and unlabeled
known identities (IDs) while simultaneously discovering new, previously unseen
IDs. Unlike typical GCD settings, GFD poses unique challenges due to the high
cardinality and fine-grained nature of face IDs, rendering existing GCD
approaches ineffective. To tackle this problem, we propose FaceGCD, a method
that dynamically constructs instance-specific feature extractors using
lightweight, layer-wise prefixes. These prefixes are generated on the fly by a
HyperNetwork, which adaptively outputs a set of prefix generators conditioned
on each input image. This dynamic design enables FaceGCD to capture subtle
identity-specific cues without relying on high-capacity static models.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that FaceGCD significantly outperforms
existing GCD methods and a strong face recognition baseline, ArcFace, achieving
state-of-the-art results on the GFD task and advancing toward open-world face
recognition.

TL;DR: MZNet是一种U型网络，通过多尺度双注意力块、多形状大核卷积块和特征融合跳跃连接，有效去除图像中的摩尔纹，在高低分辨率数据集上均表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 摩尔纹因频率混叠在摄影和工业检测中造成问题，现有CNN方法因受限的感知域难以处理其多样性和复杂性。

Method: 提出MZNet，结合MSDAB、MSLKB和特征融合跳跃连接，优化多尺度特征提取和摩尔纹结构捕捉。

Result: 在基准数据集上，MZNet在高分辨率数据集上达到最优性能，低分辨率数据集上表现竞争性，且计算成本低。

Conclusion: MZNet是高效实用的摩尔纹去除解决方案，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Moir\'e patterns, caused by frequency aliasing between fine repetitive
structures and a camera sensor's sampling process, have been a significant
obstacle in various real-world applications, such as consumer photography and
industrial defect inspection. With the advancements in deep learning
algorithms, numerous studies-predominantly based on convolutional neural
networks-have suggested various solutions to address this issue. Despite these
efforts, existing approaches still struggle to effectively eliminate artifacts
due to the diverse scales, orientations, and color shifts of moir\'e patterns,
primarily because the constrained receptive field of CNN-based architectures
limits their ability to capture the complex characteristics of moir\'e
patterns. In this paper, we propose MZNet, a U-shaped network designed to bring
images closer to a 'Moire-Zero' state by effectively removing moir\'e patterns.
It integrates three specialized components: Multi-Scale Dual Attention Block
(MSDAB) for extracting and refining multi-scale features, Multi-Shape Large
Kernel Convolution Block (MSLKB) for capturing diverse moir\'e structures, and
Feature Fusion-Based Skip Connection for enhancing information flow. Together,
these components enhance local texture restoration and large-scale artifact
suppression. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that MZNet achieves
state-of-the-art performance on high-resolution datasets and delivers
competitive results on lower-resolution dataset, while maintaining a low
computational cost, suggesting that it is an efficient and practical solution
for real-world applications. Project page:

Abstract: To address the larger computation and storage requirements associated with
large video datasets, video dataset distillation aims to capture spatial and
temporal information in a significantly smaller dataset, such that training on
the distilled data has comparable performance to training on all of the data.
We propose GVD: Guiding Video Diffusion, the first diffusion-based video
distillation method. GVD jointly distills spatial and temporal features,
ensuring high-fidelity video generation across diverse actions while capturing
essential motion information. Our method's diverse yet representative
distillations significantly outperform previous state-of-the-art approaches on
the MiniUCF and HMDB51 datasets across 5, 10, and 20 Instances Per Class (IPC).
Specifically, our method achieves 78.29 percent of the original dataset's
performance using only 1.98 percent of the total number of frames in MiniUCF.
Additionally, it reaches 73.83 percent of the performance with just 3.30
percent of the frames in HMDB51. Experimental results across benchmark video
datasets demonstrate that GVD not only achieves state-of-the-art performance
but can also generate higher resolution videos and higher IPC without
significantly increasing computational cost.

Abstract: LiDAR scene generation is critical for mitigating real-world LiDAR data
collection costs and enhancing the robustness of downstream perception tasks in
autonomous driving. However, existing methods commonly struggle to capture
geometric realism and global topological consistency. Recent LiDAR Diffusion
Models (LiDMs) predominantly embed LiDAR points into the latent space for
improved generation efficiency, which limits their interpretable ability to
model detailed geometric structures and preserve global topological
consistency. To address these challenges, we propose TopoLiDM, a novel
framework that integrates graph neural networks (GNNs) with diffusion models
under topological regularization for high-fidelity LiDAR generation. Our
approach first trains a topological-preserving VAE to extract latent graph
representations by graph construction and multiple graph convolutional layers.
Then we freeze the VAE and generate novel latent topological graphs through the
latent diffusion models. We also introduce 0-dimensional persistent homology
(PH) constraints, ensuring the generated LiDAR scenes adhere to real-world
global topological structures. Extensive experiments on the KITTI-360 dataset
demonstrate TopoLiDM's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, achieving
improvements of 22.6% lower Frechet Range Image Distance (FRID) and 9.2% lower
Minimum Matching Distance (MMD). Notably, our model also enables fast
generation speed with an average inference time of 1.68 samples/s, showcasing
its scalability for real-world applications. We will release the related codes

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于条件扩散模型的自适应水下图像增强方法，通过预测退化分数指导恢复网络，结合物理先验和混合损失函数，显著提升图像质量。


<details>

Motivation: 水下图像因散射和吸收等光学效应导致色彩失真、能见度低和结构模糊，现有方法难以自适应处理多样退化条件且未能有效利用水下物理先验。

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过自适应噪声调度和分层特征细化，有效结合物理先验，为水下图像增强提供了鲁棒且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Underwater images typically suffer from severe colour distortions, low
visibility, and reduced structural clarity due to complex optical effects such
as scattering and absorption, which greatly degrade their visual quality and
limit the performance of downstream visual perception tasks. Existing
enhancement methods often struggle to adaptively handle diverse degradation
conditions and fail to leverage underwater-specific physical priors
effectively. In this paper, we propose a degradation-aware conditional
diffusion model to enhance underwater images adaptively and robustly. Given a
degraded underwater image as input, we first predict its degradation level
using a lightweight dual-stream convolutional network, generating a continuous
degradation score as semantic guidance. Based on this score, we introduce a
novel conditional diffusion-based restoration network with a Swin UNet
backbone, enabling adaptive noise scheduling and hierarchical feature
refinement. To incorporate underwater-specific physical priors, we further
propose a degradation-guided adaptive feature fusion module and a hybrid loss
function that combines perceptual consistency, histogram matching, and
feature-level contrast. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method effectively restores underwater images with
superior colour fidelity, perceptual quality, and structural details. Compared
with SOTA approaches, our framework achieves significant improvements in both
quantitative metrics and qualitative visual assessments.

Motivation: 理解个体、群体和事件级情绪及上下文信息对分析多人社交场景至关重要，现有基准主要关注原子交互和群体级情绪感知。

Method: 采用多模态Swin-Transformer和S3Attention架构，处理输入场景、群体成员和上下文信息，生成联合预测。

Conclusion: GEMS框架为个体、群体和情境情绪响应的综合分析提供了新方向，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Understanding individual, group and event level emotions along with
contextual information is crucial for analyzing a multi-person social
situation. To achieve this, we frame emotion comprehension as the task of
predicting fine-grained individual emotion to coarse grained group and event
level emotion. We introduce GEMS that leverages a multimodal swin-transformer
and S3Attention based architecture, which processes an input scene, group
members, and context information to generate joint predictions. Existing
multi-person emotion related benchmarks mainly focus on atomic interactions
primarily based on emotion perception over time and group level. To this end,
we extend and propose VGAF-GEMS to provide more fine grained and holistic
analysis on top of existing group level annotation of VGAF dataset. GEMS aims
to predict basic discrete and continuous emotions (including valence and
arousal) as well as individual, group and event level perceived emotions. Our
benchmarking effort links individual, group and situational emotional responses
holistically. The quantitative and qualitative comparisons with adapted
state-of-the-art models demonstrate the effectiveness of GEMS framework on
VGAF-GEMS benchmarking. We believe that it will pave the way of further
research. The code and data is available at:

Motivation: 探索VLMs在频率域扰动下的表现，揭示其在真实性和图像描述任务中的不可靠性。

Method: 设计频率域的目标图像变换，测试五种先进VLMs在十种数据集上的表现。

Result: VLMs对频率扰动敏感，输出与语义内容不完全一致，且在黑盒条件下表现脆弱。

Conclusion: VLMs的可靠性受到挑战，需开发更鲁棒的多模态感知系统。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly used as perceptual modules for
visual content reasoning, including through captioning and DeepFake detection.
In this work, we expose a critical vulnerability of VLMs when exposed to
subtle, structured perturbations in the frequency domain. Specifically, we
highlight how these feature transformations undermine authenticity/DeepFake
detection and automated image captioning tasks. We design targeted image
transformations, operating in the frequency domain to systematically adjust VLM
outputs when exposed to frequency-perturbed real and synthetic images. We
demonstrate that the perturbation injection method generalizes across five
state-of-the-art VLMs which includes different-parameter Qwen2/2.5 and BLIP
models. Experimenting across ten real and generated image datasets reveals that
VLM judgments are sensitive to frequency-based cues and may not wholly align
with semantic content. Crucially, we show that visually-imperceptible spatial
frequency transformations expose the fragility of VLMs deployed for automated
image captioning and authenticity detection tasks. Our findings under
realistic, black-box constraints challenge the reliability of VLMs,
underscoring the need for robust multimodal perception systems.

Motivation: 解决MAE在掩码策略依赖性和分布外数据性能下降的问题。

Result: MINR在域内和域外场景均优于MAE，同时降低模型复杂度。

Conclusion: MINR是现有框架的鲁棒高效替代，适用于多种自监督学习任务。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning methods like masked autoencoders (MAE) have shown
significant promise in learning robust feature representations, particularly in
image reconstruction-based pretraining task. However, their performance is
often strongly dependent on the masking strategies used during training and can
degrade when applied to out-of-distribution data. To address these limitations,
we introduce the masked implicit neural representations (MINR) framework that
synergizes implicit neural representations with masked image modeling. MINR
learns a continuous function to represent images, enabling more robust and
generalizable reconstructions irrespective of masking strategies. Our
experiments demonstrate that MINR not only outperforms MAE in in-domain
scenarios but also in out-of-distribution settings, while reducing model
complexity. The versatility of MINR extends to various self-supervised learning
applications, confirming its utility as a robust and efficient alternative to
existing frameworks.

Conclusion: UAVScenes填补了多模态无人机感知的空白，为高级场景理解任务提供了基准。

Abstract: Multi-modal perception is essential for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
operations, as it enables a comprehensive understanding of the UAVs'
surrounding environment. However, most existing multi-modal UAV datasets are
primarily biased toward localization and 3D reconstruction tasks, or only
support map-level semantic segmentation due to the lack of frame-wise
annotations for both camera images and LiDAR point clouds. This limitation
prevents them from being used for high-level scene understanding tasks. To
address this gap and advance multi-modal UAV perception, we introduce
UAVScenes, a large-scale dataset designed to benchmark various tasks across
both 2D and 3D modalities. Our benchmark dataset is built upon the
well-calibrated multi-modal UAV dataset MARS-LVIG, originally developed only
for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). We enhance this dataset by
providing manually labeled semantic annotations for both frame-wise images and
LiDAR point clouds, along with accurate 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) poses.
These additions enable a wide range of UAV perception tasks, including
segmentation, depth estimation, 6-DoF localization, place recognition, and
novel view synthesis (NVS). Our dataset is available at

Conclusion: 条件流匹配方法能有效捕捉分割不确定性，提供更可靠的量化结果。

Abstract: Quantifying aleatoric uncertainty in medical image segmentation is critical
since it is a reflection of the natural variability observed among expert
annotators. A conventional approach is to model the segmentation distribution
using the generative model, but current methods limit the expression ability of
generative models. While current diffusion-based approaches have demonstrated
impressive performance in approximating the data distribution, their inherent
stochastic sampling process and inability to model exact densities limit their
effectiveness in accurately capturing uncertainty. In contrast, our proposed
method leverages conditional flow matching, a simulation-free flow-based
generative model that learns an exact density, to produce highly accurate
segmentation results. By guiding the flow model on the input image and sampling
multiple data points, our approach synthesizes segmentation samples whose
pixel-wise variance reliably reflects the underlying data distribution. This
sampling strategy captures uncertainties in regions with ambiguous boundaries,
offering robust quantification that mirrors inter-annotator differences.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only achieves competitive
segmentation accuracy but also generates uncertainty maps that provide deeper
insights into the reliability of the segmentation outcomes. The code for this

Conclusion: 通过LVLM优化数据质量和训练范式，实现了视觉语言模型的持续改进，展示了自我增强循环的潜力。

Abstract: Large-scale but noisy image-text pair data have paved the way for the success
of Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP). As the foundation vision
encoder, CLIP in turn serves as the cornerstone for most large vision-language
models (LVLMs). This interdependence naturally raises an interesting question:
Can we reciprocally leverage LVLMs to enhance the quality of image-text pair
data, thereby opening the possibility of a self-reinforcing cycle for
continuous improvement? In this work, we take a significant step toward this
vision by introducing an LVLM-driven data refinement pipeline. Our framework
leverages LVLMs to process images and their raw alt-text, generating four
complementary textual formulas: long positive descriptions, long negative
descriptions, short positive tags, and short negative tags. Applying this
pipeline to the curated DFN-Large dataset yields VLM-150M, a refined dataset
enriched with multi-grained annotations. Based on this dataset, we further
propose a training paradigm that extends conventional contrastive learning by
incorporating negative descriptions and short tags as additional supervised
signals. The resulting model, namely HQ-CLIP, demonstrates remarkable
improvements across diverse benchmarks. Within a comparable training data
scale, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot
classification, cross-modal retrieval, and fine-grained visual understanding
tasks. In retrieval benchmarks, HQ-CLIP even surpasses standard CLIP models
trained on the DFN-2B dataset, which contains 10$\times$ more training data
than ours. All code, data, and models are available at

Conclusion: 事件相机为真实世界运动模糊环境中的域适应提供了可扩展且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Human pose estimation is critical for applications such as rehabilitation,
sports analytics, and AR/VR systems. However, rapid motion and low-light
conditions often introduce motion blur, significantly degrading pose estimation
due to the domain gap between sharp and blurred images. Most datasets assume
stable conditions, making models trained on sharp images struggle in blurred
environments. To address this, we introduce a novel domain adaptation approach
that leverages event cameras, which capture high temporal resolution motion
data and are inherently robust to motion blur. Using event-based augmentation,
we generate motion-aware blurred images, effectively bridging the domain gap
between sharp and blurred domains without requiring paired annotations.
Additionally, we develop a student-teacher framework that iteratively refines
pseudo-labels, leveraging mutual uncertainty masking to eliminate incorrect
labels and enable more effective learning. Experimental results demonstrate
that our approach outperforms conventional domain-adaptive human pose
estimation methods, achieving robust pose estimation under motion blur without
requiring annotations in the target domain. Our findings highlight the
potential of event cameras as a scalable and effective solution for domain
adaptation in real-world motion blur environments. Our project codes are

Result: EDTR显著提升了多复杂退化场景下的任务性能和视觉质量。

Conclusion: EDTR有效利用扩散先验，为任务驱动图像恢复提供了新思路。

Abstract: Task-driven image restoration (TDIR) has recently emerged to address
performance drops in high-level vision tasks caused by low-quality (LQ) inputs.
Previous TDIR methods struggle to handle practical scenarios in which images
are degraded by multiple complex factors, leaving minimal clues for
restoration. This motivates us to leverage the diffusion prior, one of the most
powerful natural image priors. However, while the diffusion prior can help
generate visually plausible results, using it to restore task-relevant details
remains challenging, even when combined with recent TDIR methods. To address
this, we propose EDTR, which effectively harnesses the power of diffusion prior
to restore task-relevant details. Specifically, we propose directly leveraging
useful clues from LQ images in the diffusion process by generating from
pixel-error-based pre-restored LQ images with mild noise added. Moreover, we
employ a small number of denoising steps to prevent the generation of redundant
details that dilute crucial task-related information. We demonstrate that our
method effectively utilizes diffusion prior for TDIR, significantly enhancing
task performance and visual quality across diverse tasks with multiple complex
degradations.

Abstract: Unsupervised Video Object Segmentation (UVOS) aims to predict pixel-level
masks for the most salient objects in videos without any prior annotations.
While memory mechanisms have been proven critical in various video segmentation
paradigms, their application in UVOS yield only marginal performance gains
despite sophisticated design. Our analysis reveals a simple but fundamental
flaw in existing methods: over-reliance on memorizing high-level semantic
features. UVOS inherently suffers from the deficiency of lacking fine-grained
information due to the absence of pixel-level prior knowledge. Consequently,
memory design relying solely on high-level features, which predominantly
capture abstract semantic cues, is insufficient to generate precise
predictions. To resolve this fundamental issue, we propose a novel hierarchical
memory architecture to incorporate both shallow- and high-level features for
memory, which leverages the complementary benefits of pixel and semantic
information. Furthermore, to balance the simultaneous utilization of the pixel
and semantic memory features, we propose a heterogeneous interaction mechanism
to perform pixel-semantic mutual interactions, which explicitly considers their
inherent feature discrepancies. Through the design of Pixel-guided Local
Alignment Module (PLAM) and Semantic-guided Global Integration Module (SGIM),
we achieve delicate integration of the fine-grained details in shallow-level
memory and the semantic representations in high-level memory. Our Hierarchical
Memory with Heterogeneous Interaction Network (HMHI-Net) consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance across all UVOS and video saliency detection
benchmarks. Moreover, HMHI-Net consistently exhibits high performance across
different backbones, further demonstrating its superiority and robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度伪造检测方法仅依赖图像域分类器，缺乏辅助任务增强鲁棒性，而VLM的零样本能力为解决这一问题提供了新思路。

Method: 利用VLM进行图像分类，并在高质量深度伪造数据集（60,000张图像）上评估零样本性能，同时比较InstructBLIP在DFDC-P数据集上的表现。

Result: 零样本模型表现优于现有方法，VLM在零样本和微调场景下均优于传统分类器。

Conclusion: VLM在深度伪造检测中展现出显著优势，为零样本任务提供了新方向。

Abstract: The contemporary phenomenon of deepfakes, utilizing GAN or diffusion models
for face swapping, presents a substantial and evolving threat in digital media,
identity verification, and a multitude of other systems. The majority of
existing methods for detecting deepfakes rely on training specialized
classifiers to distinguish between genuine and manipulated images, focusing
only on the image domain without incorporating any auxiliary tasks that could
enhance robustness. In this paper, inspired by the zero-shot capabilities of
Vision Language Models, we propose a novel VLM-based approach to image
classification and then evaluate it for deepfake detection. Specifically, we
utilize a new high-quality deepfake dataset comprising 60,000 images, on which
our zero-shot models demonstrate superior performance to almost all existing
methods. Subsequently, we compare the performance of the best-performing
architecture, InstructBLIP, on the popular deepfake dataset DFDC-P against
traditional methods in two scenarios: zero-shot and in-domain fine-tuning. Our
results demonstrate the superiority of VLMs over traditional classifiers.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多模态裂缝分割任务中缺乏自适应感知和高效交互融合跨模态特征的能力。

Method: LIDAR由LacaVSS和LD3CF模块组成，分别通过EDG-SS策略和AFDP感知器实现自适应线索建模和多模态特征融合。

Result: 在三个数据集上表现优于现有方法，其中在光场深度数据集上F1为0.8204，mIoU为0.8465，参数仅5.35M。

Conclusion: LIDAR通过轻量化设计和高效特征融合，显著提升了裂缝分割的性能和效率。

Abstract: Achieving pixel-level segmentation with low computational cost using
multimodal data remains a key challenge in crack segmentation tasks. Existing
methods lack the capability for adaptive perception and efficient interactive
fusion of cross-modal features. To address these challenges, we propose a
Lightweight Adaptive Cue-Aware Vision Mamba network (LIDAR), which efficiently
perceives and integrates morphological and textural cues from different
modalities under multimodal crack scenarios, generating clear pixel-level crack
segmentation maps. Specifically, LIDAR is composed of a Lightweight Adaptive
Cue-Aware Visual State Space module (LacaVSS) and a Lightweight Dual Domain
Dynamic Collaborative Fusion module (LD3CF). LacaVSS adaptively models crack
cues through the proposed mask-guided Efficient Dynamic Guided Scanning
Strategy (EDG-SS), while LD3CF leverages an Adaptive Frequency Domain
Perceptron (AFDP) and a dual-pooling fusion strategy to effectively capture
spatial and frequency-domain cues across modalities. Moreover, we design a
Lightweight Dynamically Modulated Multi-Kernel convolution (LDMK) to perceive
complex morphological structures with minimal computational overhead, replacing
most convolutional operations in LIDAR. Experiments on three datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.
On the light-field depth dataset, our method achieves 0.8204 in F1 and 0.8465
in mIoU with only 5.35M parameters. Code and datasets are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如基于单应性或网格流的技术）在复杂非平面场景中表现不佳，无法捕捉复杂运动模式。

Method: CamFlow结合物理基（相机几何）和随机基（复杂场景），使用基于拉普拉斯分布的混合概率损失函数进行训练。

Conclusion: CamFlow通过混合运动基和概率损失函数，显著提升了2D相机运动估计的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Estimating 2D camera motion is a fundamental computer vision task that models
the projection of 3D camera movements onto the 2D image plane. Current methods
rely on either homography-based approaches, limited to planar scenes, or
meshflow techniques that use grid-based local homographies but struggle with
complex non-linear transformations. A key insight of our work is that combining
flow fields from different homographies creates motion patterns that cannot be
represented by any single homography. We introduce CamFlow, a novel framework
that represents camera motion using hybrid motion bases: physical bases derived
from camera geometry and stochastic bases for complex scenarios. Our approach
includes a hybrid probabilistic loss function based on the Laplace distribution
that enhances training robustness. For evaluation, we create a new benchmark by
masking dynamic objects in existing optical flow datasets to isolate pure
camera motion. Experiments show CamFlow outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across diverse scenarios, demonstrating superior robustness and generalization
in zero-shot settings. Code and datasets are available at our project page:

Motivation: 现有All-in-One模型难以捕捉多样化和局部化的天气退化模式，需要更有效的方法。

Result: 实验证明SSGformer在多样复杂天气退化处理中表现优越。

Conclusion: SSGformer通过频谱和空间分组注意力机制，有效解决了多天气图像恢复问题。

Abstract: Adverse weather conditions cause diverse and complex degradation patterns,
driving the development of All-in-One (AiO) models. However, recent AiO
solutions still struggle to capture diverse degradations, since global
filtering methods like direct operations on the frequency domain fail to handle
highly variable and localized distortions. To address these issue, we propose
Spectral-based Spatial Grouping Transformer (SSGformer), a novel approach that
leverages spectral decomposition and group-wise attention for multi-weather
image restoration. SSGformer decomposes images into high-frequency edge
features using conventional edge detection and low-frequency information via
Singular Value Decomposition. We utilize multi-head linear attention to
effectively model the relationship between these features. The fused features
are integrated with the input to generate a grouping-mask that clusters regions
based on the spatial similarity and image texture. To fully leverage this mask,
we introduce a group-wise attention mechanism, enabling robust adverse weather
removal and ensuring consistent performance across diverse weather conditions.
We also propose a Spatial Grouping Transformer Block that uses both channel
attention and spatial attention, effectively balancing feature-wise
relationships and spatial dependencies. Extensive experiments show the
superiority of our approach, validating its effectiveness in handling the
varied and intricate adverse weather degradations.

Method: 提出ACTIVE数据集（30类动作，80名参与者，46,868视频实例）和ACTIVE-PC方法（多级邻域采样、分层识别器等）。

Result: ACTIVE-PC在长距离动作识别中表现有效。

Conclusion: ACTIVE和ACTIVE-PC为N-HRI研究提供了全面且具有挑战性的基准和方法。

Abstract: Natural Human-Robot Interaction (N-HRI) requires robots to recognize human
actions at varying distances and states, regardless of whether the robot itself
is in motion or stationary. This setup is more flexible and practical than
conventional human action recognition tasks. However, existing benchmarks
designed for traditional action recognition fail to address the unique
complexities in N-HRI due to limited data, modalities, task categories, and
diversity of subjects and environments. To address these challenges, we
introduce ACTIVE (Action from Robotic View), a large-scale dataset tailored
specifically for perception-centric robotic views prevalent in mobile service
robots. ACTIVE comprises 30 composite action categories, 80 participants, and
46,868 annotated video instances, covering both RGB and point cloud modalities.
Participants performed various human actions in diverse environments at
distances ranging from 3m to 50m, while the camera platform was also mobile,
simulating real-world scenarios of robot perception with varying camera heights
due to uneven ground. This comprehensive and challenging benchmark aims to
advance action and attribute recognition research in N-HRI. Furthermore, we
propose ACTIVE-PC, a method that accurately perceives human actions at long
distances using Multilevel Neighborhood Sampling, Layered Recognizers, Elastic
Ellipse Query, and precise decoupling of kinematic interference from human
actions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of ACTIVE-PC. Our

Abstract: The segmentation of the hepatic vasculature in surgical videos holds
substantial clinical significance in the context of hepatectomy procedures.
However, owing to the dearth of an appropriate dataset and the inherently
complex task characteristics, few researches have been reported in this domain.
To address this issue, we first introduce a high quality frame-by-frame
annotated hepatic vasculature dataset containing 35 long hepatectomy videos and
11442 high-resolution frames. On this basis, we propose a novel high-resolution
video vasculature segmentation network, dubbed as HRVVS. We innovatively embed
a pretrained visual autoregressive modeling (VAR) model into different layers
of the hierarchical encoder as prior information to reduce the information
degradation generated during the downsampling process. In addition, we designed
a dynamic memory decoder on a multi-view segmentation network to minimize the
transmission of redundant information while preserving more details between
frames. Extensive experiments on surgical video datasets demonstrate that our
proposed HRVVS significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. The
source code and dataset will be publicly available at

Conclusion: 该方法通过动态演化提示表示，显著提升了持续学习的性能，为复杂任务需求提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Prompt-based continual learning provides a rehearsal-free solution by tuning
small sets of parameters while keeping pre-trained models frozen. To meet the
complex demands of sequential tasks, it is crucial to integrate task-specific
knowledge within prompts effectively. However, existing works rely on either
fixed learned prompts (i.e., prompts whose representations remain unchanged
during new task learning) or on prompts generated from an entangled task-shared
space, limiting the representational diversity of the integrated prompt. To
address this issue, we propose a novel prompt-evolving mechanism to adaptively
aggregate base prompts (i.e., task-specific prompts) into a unified prompt
while ensuring diversity. By transforming and aligning base prompts, both
previously learned and newly introduced, our approach continuously evolves
accumulated knowledge to facilitate learning new tasks. We further introduce a
learnable probabilistic gate that adaptively determines which layers to
activate during the evolution process. We validate our method on image
classification and video action recognition tasks in class-incremental
learning, achieving average gains of 9.07% and 7.40% over existing methods
across all scenarios.

Abstract: Accurate identification of breast lesion subtypes can facilitate personalized
treatment and interventions. Ultrasound (US), as a safe and accessible imaging
modality, is extensively employed in breast abnormality screening and
diagnosis. However, the incidence of different subtypes exhibits a skewed
long-tailed distribution, posing significant challenges for automated
recognition. Generative augmentation provides a promising solution to rectify
data distribution. Inspired by this, we propose a dual-phase framework for
long-tailed classification that mitigates distributional bias through
high-fidelity data synthesis while avoiding overuse that corrupts holistic
performance. The framework incorporates a reinforcement learning-driven
adaptive sampler, dynamically calibrating synthetic-real data ratios by
training a strategic multi-agent to compensate for scarcities of real data
while ensuring stable discriminative capability. Furthermore, our
class-controllable synthetic network integrates a sketch-grounded perception
branch that harnesses anatomical priors to maintain distinctive class features
while enabling annotation-free inference. Extensive experiments on an in-house
long-tailed and a public imbalanced breast US datasets demonstrate that our
method achieves promising performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Motivation: 解决OOD检测性能受限于单一分类器能力的问题，通过集成不同分类器提升鲁棒性。

Method: 创建异构集成（COOkeD），结合封闭世界分类器、零样本CLIP分类器和线性探测分类器。

Result: 在CIFAR100和ImageNet等基准测试中，COOkeD实现了SOTA性能，并在多种挑战性场景下表现出更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: COOkeD通过简单但有效的异构集成方法，显著提升了OOD检测性能，且具有模块化和后处理优势。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is an important building block in
trustworthy image recognition systems as unknown classes may arise at
test-time. OOD detection methods typically revolve around a single classifier,
leading to a split in the research field between the classical supervised
setting (e.g. ResNet18 classifier trained on CIFAR100) vs. the zero-shot
setting (class names fed as prompts to CLIP). In both cases, an overarching
challenge is that the OOD detection performance is implicitly constrained by
the classifier's capabilities on in-distribution (ID) data. In this work, we
show that given a little open-mindedness from both ends, remarkable OOD
detection can be achieved by instead creating a heterogeneous ensemble - COOkeD
combines the predictions of a closed-world classifier trained end-to-end on a
specific dataset, a zero-shot CLIP classifier, and a linear probe classifier
trained on CLIP image features. While bulky at first sight, this approach is
modular, post-hoc and leverages the availability of pre-trained VLMs, thus
introduces little overhead compared to training a single standard classifier.
We evaluate COOkeD on popular CIFAR100 and ImageNet benchmarks, but also
consider more challenging, realistic settings ranging from training-time label
noise, to test-time covariate shift, to zero-shot shift which has been
previously overlooked. Despite its simplicity, COOkeD achieves state-of-the-art
performance and greater robustness compared to both classical and CLIP-based
OOD detection methods. Code is available at https://github.com/glhr/COOkeD

Abstract: In this paper, we present a deepfake detection algorithm specifically
designed for electronic Know Your Customer (eKYC) systems. To ensure the
reliability of eKYC systems against deepfake attacks, it is essential to
develop a robust deepfake detector capable of identifying both face swapping
and face reenactment, while also being robust to image degradation. We address
these challenges through three key contributions: (1)~Our approach evaluates
the video's authenticity by detecting temporal inconsistencies in identity
vectors extracted by face recognition models, leading to comprehensive
detection of both face swapping and face reenactment. (2)~In addition to
processing video input, the algorithm utilizes a registered image (assumed to
be genuine) to calculate identity discrepancies between the input video and the
registered image, significantly improving detection accuracy. (3)~We find that
employing a face feature extractor trained on a larger dataset enhances both
detection performance and robustness against image degradation. Our
experimental results show that our proposed method accurately detects both face
swapping and face reenactment comprehensively and is robust against various
forms of unseen image degradation. Our source code is publicly available

Abstract: Backpropagation-based approaches aim to align diffusion models with reward
functions through end-to-end backpropagation of the reward gradient within the
denoising chain, offering a promising perspective. However, due to the
computational costs and the risk of gradient explosion associated with the
lengthy denoising chain, existing approaches struggle to achieve complete
gradient backpropagation, leading to suboptimal results. In this paper, we
introduce Shortcut-based Fine-Tuning (ShortFT), an efficient fine-tuning
strategy that utilizes the shorter denoising chain. More specifically, we
employ the recently researched trajectory-preserving few-step diffusion model,
which enables a shortcut over the original denoising chain, and construct a
shortcut-based denoising chain of shorter length. The optimization on this
chain notably enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of fine-tuning the
foundational model. Our method has been rigorously tested and can be
effectively applied to various reward functions, significantly improving
alignment performance and surpassing state-of-the-art alternatives.

Conclusion: PCuRL框架有效提升了多模态推理模型的性能和稳定性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has proven its effectiveness in enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of large language models. Recent research efforts have
progressively extended this paradigm to multimodal reasoning tasks. Due to the
inherent complexity and diversity of multimodal tasks, especially in semantic
content and problem formulations, existing models often exhibit unstable
performance across various domains and difficulty levels. To address these
limitations, we propose VL-Cogito, an advanced multimodal reasoning model
trained via a novel multi-stage Progressive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning
(PCuRL) framework. PCuRL systematically guides the model through tasks of
gradually increasing difficulty, substantially improving its reasoning
abilities across diverse multimodal contexts. The framework introduces two key
innovations: (1) an online difficulty soft weighting mechanism, dynamically
adjusting training difficulty across successive RL training stages; and (2) a
dynamic length reward mechanism, which encourages the model to adaptively
regulate its reasoning path length according to task complexity, thus balancing
reasoning efficiency with correctness. Experimental evaluations demonstrate
that VL-Cogito consistently matches or surpasses existing reasoning-oriented
models across mainstream multimodal benchmarks spanning mathematics, science,

TL;DR: 提出GALTraj方法，通过生成式主动学习改进轨迹预测训练过程，提升长尾场景性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决数据驱动轨迹预测在罕见长尾场景中的性能不足问题，避免修改模型结构。

Method: 引入GALTraj，结合可控扩散模型主动识别并增强训练中失败样本，生成多样且符合交通规则的轨迹。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型上验证，显著提升长尾和头部样本的预测性能。

Conclusion: GALTraj首次成功将生成式主动学习应用于轨迹预测，为长尾学习提供新思路。

Abstract: While data-driven trajectory prediction has enhanced the reliability of
autonomous driving systems, it still struggles with rarely observed long-tail
scenarios. Prior works addressed this by modifying model architectures, such as
using hypernetworks. In contrast, we propose refining the training process to
unlock each model's potential without altering its structure. We introduce
Generative Active Learning for Trajectory prediction (GALTraj), the first
method to successfully deploy generative active learning into trajectory
prediction. It actively identifies rare tail samples where the model fails and
augments these samples with a controllable diffusion model during training. In
our framework, generating scenarios that are diverse, realistic, and preserve
tail-case characteristics is paramount. Accordingly, we design a tail-aware
generation method that applies tailored diffusion guidance to generate
trajectories that both capture rare behaviors and respect traffic rules. Unlike
prior simulation methods focused solely on scenario diversity, GALTraj is the
first to show how simulator-driven augmentation benefits long-tail learning in
trajectory prediction. Experiments on multiple trajectory datasets (WOMD,
Argoverse2) with popular backbones (QCNet, MTR) confirm that our method
significantly boosts performance on tail samples and also enhances accuracy on
head samples.

Abstract: Accurate and reliable brain tumor segmentation, particularly when dealing
with missing modalities, remains a critical challenge in medical image
analysis. Previous studies have not fully resolved the challenges of tumor
boundary segmentation insensitivity and feature transfer in the absence of key
imaging modalities. In this study, we introduce MST-KDNet, aimed at addressing
these critical issues. Our model features Multi-Scale Transformer Knowledge
Distillation to effectively capture attention weights at various resolutions,
Dual-Mode Logit Distillation to improve the transfer of knowledge, and a Global
Style Matching Module that integrates feature matching with adversarial
learning. Comprehensive experiments conducted on the BraTS and FeTS 2024
datasets demonstrate that MST-KDNet surpasses current leading methods in both
Dice and HD95 scores, particularly in conditions with substantial modality
loss. Our approach shows exceptional robustness and generalization potential,
making it a promising candidate for real-world clinical applications. Our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时尚设计需要结合视觉和文本表达，现有方法难以同时处理全局描述和局部细节。

Method: LOTS采用模块化对中心表示和扩散对引导策略，将草图和文本编码到共享潜在空间，并通过注意力引导扩散模型。

Result: LOTS在全局和局部指标上均达到最优性能，并展示了前所未有的设计定制能力。

Conclusion: LOTS为时尚图像生成提供了高效且灵活的解决方案，支持高度定制化设计。

Abstract: Fashion design is a complex creative process that blends visual and textual
expressions. Designers convey ideas through sketches, which define spatial
structure and design elements, and textual descriptions, capturing material,
texture, and stylistic details. In this paper, we present LOcalized Text and
Sketch for fashion image generation (LOTS), an approach for compositional
sketch-text based generation of complete fashion outlooks. LOTS leverages a
global description with paired localized sketch + text information for
conditioning and introduces a novel step-based merging strategy for diffusion
adaptation. First, a Modularized Pair-Centric representation encodes sketches
and text into a shared latent space while preserving independent localized
features; then, a Diffusion Pair Guidance phase integrates both local and
global conditioning via attention-based guidance within the diffusion model's
multi-step denoising process. To validate our method, we build on Fashionpedia
to release Sketchy, the first fashion dataset where multiple text-sketch pairs
are provided per image. Quantitative results show LOTS achieves
state-of-the-art image generation performance on both global and localized
metrics, while qualitative examples and a human evaluation study highlight its
unprecedented level of design customization.

Abstract: The proliferation of drones in civilian airspace has raised urgent security
concerns, necessitating robust real-time surveillance systems. In response to
the 2025 VIP Cup challenge tasks - drone detection, tracking, and payload
identification - we propose a dual-stream drone monitoring framework. Our
approach deploys independent You Only Look Once v11-nano (YOLOv11n) object
detectors on parallel infrared (thermal) and visible (RGB) data streams,
deliberately avoiding early fusion. This separation allows each model to be
specifically optimized for the distinct characteristics of its input modality,
addressing the unique challenges posed by small aerial objects in diverse
environmental conditions. We customize data preprocessing and augmentation
strategies per domain - such as limiting color jitter for IR imagery - and
fine-tune training hyperparameters to enhance detection performance under
conditions of heavy noise, low light, and motion blur. The resulting
lightweight YOLOv11n models demonstrate high accuracy in distinguishing drones
from birds and in classifying payload types, all while maintaining real-time
performance. This report details the rationale for a dual-modality design, the
specialized training pipelines, and the architectural optimizations that
collectively enable efficient and accurate drone surveillance across RGB and IR
channels.

Conclusion: 全局结构依赖的考虑能有效提升数据增强的真实性和分割任务的表现。

Abstract: 3D point cloud segmentation aims to assign semantic labels to individual
points in a scene for fine-grained spatial understanding. Existing methods
typically adopt data augmentation to alleviate the burden of large-scale
annotation. However, most augmentation strategies only focus on local
transformations or semantic recomposition, lacking the consideration of global
structural dependencies within scenes. To address this limitation, we propose a
graph-guided data augmentation framework with dual-level constraints for
realistic 3D scene synthesis. Our method learns object relationship statistics
from real-world data to construct guiding graphs for scene generation.
Local-level constraints enforce geometric plausibility and semantic consistency
between objects, while global-level constraints maintain the topological
structure of the scene by aligning the generated layout with the guiding graph.
Extensive experiments on indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate that our
framework generates diverse and high-quality augmented scenes, leading to
consistent improvements in point cloud segmentation performance across various
models.

Conclusion: 扩散模型在异常检测中表现出强大潜力，未来有望成为基础工具。

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs is pivotal for deploying safe
vision systems in open-world environments. We revisit diffusion models, not as
generators, but as universal perceptual templates for OOD detection. This
research explores the use of score-based generative models as foundational
tools for semantic anomaly detection across unseen datasets. Specifically, we
leverage the denoising trajectories of Denoising Diffusion Models (DDMs) as a
rich source of texture and semantic information. By analyzing Stein score
errors, amplified through the Structural Similarity Index Metric (SSIM), we
introduce a novel method for identifying anomalous samples without requiring
re-training on each target dataset. Our approach improves over state-of-the-art
and relies on training a single model on one dataset -- CelebA -- which we find
to be an effective base distribution, even outperforming more commonly used
datasets like ImageNet in several settings. Experimental results show
near-perfect performance on some benchmarks, with notable headroom on others,
highlighting both the strength and future potential of generative foundation
models in anomaly detection.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SfT方法依赖点对应关系，在严重遮挡时性能下降；现代方法虽无需对应关系，但需要大量监督数据。本文旨在开发一种无需监督且高效的方法。

Method: 结合图像观测（颜色、梯度、轮廓）和网格不可延伸性约束，采用无监督方式重建3D形状。

Result: 方法比现有最佳无监督SfT快400倍，且在细节生成和遮挡处理上表现更优。

Conclusion: 提出的无监督SfT方法高效且鲁棒，适用于复杂场景。

Abstract: Shape-from-Template (SfT) refers to the class of methods that reconstruct the
3D shape of a deforming object from images/videos using a 3D template.
Traditional SfT methods require point correspondences between images and the
texture of the 3D template in order to reconstruct 3D shapes from images/videos
in real time. Their performance severely degrades when encountered with severe
occlusions in the images because of the unavailability of correspondences. In
contrast, modern SfT methods use a correspondence-free approach by
incorporating deep neural networks to reconstruct 3D objects, thus requiring
huge amounts of data for supervision. Recent advances use a fully unsupervised
or self-supervised approach by combining differentiable physics and graphics to
deform 3D template to match input images. In this paper, we propose an
unsupervised SfT which uses only image observations: color features, gradients
and silhouettes along with a mesh inextensibility constraint to reconstruct at
a $400\times$ faster pace than (best-performing) unsupervised SfT. Moreover,
when it comes to generating finer details and severe occlusions, our method
outperforms the existing methodologies by a large margin. Code is available at

Abstract: Structure and continuous motion estimation from point correspondences is a
fundamental problem in computer vision that has been powered by well-known
algorithms such as the familiar 5-point or 8-point algorithm. However, despite
their acclaim, these algorithms are limited to processing point correspondences
originating from a pair of views each one representing an instantaneous capture
of the scene. Yet, in the case of rolling shutter cameras, or more recently,
event cameras, this synchronization breaks down. In this work, we present a
unified approach for structure and linear motion estimation from 2D point
correspondences with arbitrary timestamps, from an arbitrary set of views. By
formulating the problem in terms of first-order dynamics and leveraging a
constant velocity motion model, we derive a novel, linear point incidence
relation allowing for the efficient recovery of both linear velocity and 3D
points with predictable degeneracies and solution multiplicities. Owing to its
general formulation, it can handle correspondences from a wide range of sensing
modalities such as global shutter, rolling shutter, and event cameras, and can
even combine correspondences from different collocated sensors. We validate the
effectiveness of our solver on both simulated and real-world data, where we
show consistent improvement across all modalities when compared to recent
approaches. We believe our work opens the door to efficient structure and
motion estimation from asynchronous data. Code can be found at

Abstract: Accurate human trajectory prediction is one of the most crucial tasks for
autonomous driving, ensuring its safety. Yet, existing models often fail to
fully leverage the visual cues that humans subconsciously communicate when
navigating the space. In this work, we study the benefits of predicting human
trajectories using human body poses instead of solely their Cartesian space
locations in time. We propose `Social-pose', an attention-based pose encoder
that effectively captures the poses of all humans in a scene and their social
relations. Our method can be integrated into various trajectory prediction
architectures. We have conducted extensive experiments on state-of-the-art
models (based on LSTM, GAN, MLP, and Transformer), and showed improvements over
all of them on synthetic (Joint Track Auto) and real (Human3.6M, Pedestrians
and Cyclists in Road Traffic, and JRDB) datasets. We also explored the
advantages of using 2D versus 3D poses, as well as the effect of noisy poses
and the application of our pose-based predictor in robot navigation scenarios.

Abstract: Feature matching is a cornerstone task in computer vision, essential for
applications such as image retrieval, stereo matching, 3D reconstruction, and
SLAM. This survey comprehensively reviews modality-based feature matching,
exploring traditional handcrafted methods and emphasizing contemporary deep
learning approaches across various modalities, including RGB images, depth
images, 3D point clouds, LiDAR scans, medical images, and vision-language
interactions. Traditional methods, leveraging detectors like Harris corners and

intra-modality variations but struggle with significant modality gaps.
Contemporary deep learning-based methods, exemplified by detector-free
strategies like CNN-based SuperPoint and transformer-based LoFTR, substantially
improve robustness and adaptability across modalities. We highlight
modality-aware advancements, such as geometric and depth-specific descriptors
for depth images, sparse and dense learning methods for 3D point clouds,
attention-enhanced neural networks for LiDAR scans, and specialized solutions
like the MIND descriptor for complex medical image matching. Cross-modal
applications, particularly in medical image registration and vision-language

Abstract: Video Object Segmentation and Tracking (VOST) presents a complex yet critical
challenge in computer vision, requiring robust integration of segmentation and
tracking across temporally dynamic frames. Traditional methods have struggled
with domain generalization, temporal consistency, and computational efficiency.
The emergence of foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and
its successor, SAM2, has introduced a paradigm shift, enabling prompt-driven
segmentation with strong generalization capabilities. Building upon these
advances, this survey provides a comprehensive review of SAM/SAM2-based methods
for VOST, structured along three temporal dimensions: past, present, and
future. We examine strategies for retaining and updating historical information
(past), approaches for extracting and optimizing discriminative features from
the current frame (present), and motion prediction and trajectory estimation
mechanisms for anticipating object dynamics in subsequent frames (future). In
doing so, we highlight the evolution from early memory-based architectures to
the streaming memory and real-time segmentation capabilities of SAM2. We also
discuss recent innovations such as motion-aware memory selection and
trajectory-guided prompting, which aim to enhance both accuracy and efficiency.
Finally, we identify remaining challenges including memory redundancy, error
accumulation, and prompt inefficiency, and suggest promising directions for
future research. This survey offers a timely and structured overview of the
field, aiming to guide researchers and practitioners in advancing the state of
VOST through the lens of foundation models.

Abstract: Accurate fetal biometric measurements, such as abdominal circumference, play
a vital role in prenatal care. However, obtaining high-quality ultrasound
images for these measurements heavily depends on the expertise of sonographers,
posing a significant challenge in low-income countries due to the scarcity of
trained personnel. To address this issue, we leverage FetalCLIP, a
vision-language model pretrained on a curated dataset of over 210,000 fetal
ultrasound image-caption pairs, to perform automated fetal ultrasound image
quality assessment (IQA) on blind-sweep ultrasound data. We introduce
FetalCLIP$_{CLS}$, an IQA model adapted from FetalCLIP using Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA), and evaluate it on the ACOUSLIC-AI dataset against six CNN
and Transformer baselines. FetalCLIP$_{CLS}$ achieves the highest F1 score of
0.757. Moreover, we show that an adapted segmentation model, when repurposed
for classification, further improves performance, achieving an F1 score of
0.771. Our work demonstrates how parameter-efficient fine-tuning of fetal
ultrasound foundation models can enable task-specific adaptations, advancing
prenatal care in resource-limited settings. The experimental code is available

*Yuqi Pang,Bowen Yang,Yun Cao,Fan Rong,Xiaoyu Li,Chen He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoCHA是一个新型视觉框架，通过整合多种视觉骨干网络和稀疏专家混合模块，动态提取互补视觉特征，并采用分层组注意力机制优化视觉信息利用，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉大语言模型（VLLMs）在训练和推理成本高、跨模态信息融合困难以及视觉细节提取不足等方面存在问题。

Method: MoCHA整合了CLIP、SigLIP、DINOv2和ConvNeXt四种视觉骨干网络，并设计了稀疏专家混合连接器（MoECs）和分层组注意力（HGA）模块。

Result: MoCHA在多个基准测试中表现优异，例如在POPE任务上提升3.25%，在MME任务上提升153分，超越了现有开源模型。

Conclusion: MoCHA通过MoECs和HGA模块有效提升了性能，证明了其在视觉任务中的高效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Vision large language models (VLLMs) are focusing primarily on handling
complex and fine-grained visual information by incorporating advanced vision
encoders and scaling up visual models. However, these approaches face high
training and inference costs, as well as challenges in extracting visual
details, effectively bridging across modalities. In this work, we propose a
novel visual framework, MoCHA, to address these issues. Our framework
integrates four vision backbones (i.e., CLIP, SigLIP, DINOv2 and ConvNeXt) to
extract complementary visual features and is equipped with a sparse Mixture of
Experts Connectors (MoECs) module to dynamically select experts tailored to
different visual dimensions. To mitigate redundant or insufficient use of the
visual information encoded by the MoECs module, we further design a
Hierarchical Group Attention (HGA) with intra- and inter-group operations and
an adaptive gating strategy for encoded visual features. We train MoCHA on two
mainstream LLMs (e.g., Phi2-2.7B and Vicuna-7B) and evaluate their performance
across various benchmarks. Notably, MoCHA outperforms state-of-the-art
open-weight models on various tasks. For example, compared to CuMo
(Mistral-7B), our MoCHA (Phi2-2.7B) presents outstanding abilities to mitigate
hallucination by showing improvements of 3.25% in POPE and to follow visual
instructions by raising 153 points on MME. Finally, ablation studies further
confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed MoECs and HGA in
improving the overall performance of MoCHA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种数据无关、零样本的触发器反演策略DISTIL，通过扩散生成器在受限搜索空间中高效重构恶意触发器，显著提升后门防御性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络易受后门攻击，现有触发器反演方法缺乏对触发器真实性的保证，且依赖强假设。

Method: 结合扩散生成器和目标分类器，通过迭代生成候选触发器，使其与模型内部恶意行为表征对齐。

Result: DISTIL在BackdoorBench数据集上准确率提升7.1%，在特洛伊目标检测模型扫描中提升9.4%。

Conclusion: DISTIL为无需大量数据或强假设的后门防御提供了新方向。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have demonstrated remarkable success across numerous
tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to Trojan (backdoor) attacks, raising serious
concerns about their safety in real-world mission-critical applications. A
common countermeasure is trigger inversion -- reconstructing malicious
"shortcut" patterns (triggers) inserted by an adversary during training.
Current trigger-inversion methods typically search the full pixel space under
specific assumptions but offer no assurances that the estimated trigger is more
than an adversarial perturbation that flips the model output. Here, we propose
a data-free, zero-shot trigger-inversion strategy that restricts the search
space while avoiding strong assumptions on trigger appearance. Specifically, we
incorporate a diffusion-based generator guided by the target classifier;
through iterative generation, we produce candidate triggers that align with the
internal representations the model relies on for malicious behavior. Empirical
evaluations, both quantitative and qualitative, show that our approach
reconstructs triggers that effectively distinguish clean versus Trojaned
models. DISTIL surpasses alternative methods by high margins, achieving up to
7.1% higher accuracy on the BackdoorBench dataset and a 9.4% improvement on
trojaned object detection model scanning, offering a promising new direction
for reliable backdoor defense without reliance on extensive data or strong
prior assumptions about triggers. The code is available at

*Patryk Rygiel,Julian Suk,Christoph Brune,Kak Khee Yeung,Jelmer M. Wolterink*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于几何深度学习的模型，用于快速估计腹主动脉瘤患者的血流动力学参数，并验证了其在实际临床场景中的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 腹主动脉瘤（AAA）破裂风险高，传统计算流体动力学（CFD）模拟耗时且计算量大，需要更高效的替代方法。

Method: 采用E(3)-等变深度学习模型，结合新颖的几何描述符和投影几何代数，利用100名AAA患者的CT扫描数据训练模型，预测瞬态壁面剪切应力（WSS）。

Result: 模型在分布内和外部测试集上均表现良好，能够适应几何重构和边界条件变化，且对网格分辨率不敏感。

Conclusion: 该模型具有高精度和强泛化能力，有望在临床实践中用于血流动力学参数估计。

Abstract: Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are pathologic dilatations of the abdominal
aorta posing a high fatality risk upon rupture. Studying AAA progression and
rupture risk often involves in-silico blood flow modelling with computational
fluid dynamics (CFD) and extraction of hemodynamic factors like time-averaged
wall shear stress (TAWSS) or oscillatory shear index (OSI). However, CFD
simulations are known to be computationally demanding. Hence, in recent years,
geometric deep learning methods, operating directly on 3D shapes, have been
proposed as compelling surrogates, estimating hemodynamic parameters in just a
few seconds. In this work, we propose a geometric deep learning approach to
estimating hemodynamics in AAA patients, and study its generalisability to
common factors of real-world variation. We propose an E(3)-equivariant deep
learning model utilising novel robust geometrical descriptors and projective
geometric algebra. Our model is trained to estimate transient WSS using a
dataset of CT scans of 100 AAA patients, from which lumen geometries are
extracted and reference CFD simulations with varying boundary conditions are
obtained. Results show that the model generalizes well within the distribution,
as well as to the external test set. Moreover, the model can accurately
estimate hemodynamics across geometry remodelling and changes in boundary
conditions. Furthermore, we find that a trained model can be applied to
different artery tree topologies, where new and unseen branches are added
during inference. Finally, we find that the model is to a large extent agnostic
to mesh resolution. These results show the accuracy and generalisation of the
proposed model, and highlight its potential to contribute to hemodynamic
parameter estimation in clinical practice.

*Mian Zou,Nan Zhong,Baosheng Yu,Yibing Zhan,Kede Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于双层优化的自监督方法，用于检测AI生成的人脸，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI生成人脸检测器依赖于特定生成器的合成图像，泛化能力有限。

Method: 通过内循环预训练视觉编码器，外循环优化任务权重，结合高斯混合模型或轻量级感知器进行检测。

Result: 在单类和二分类任务中表现优异，对未见过的生成器有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了AI生成人脸检测的泛化性和性能。

Abstract: AI-generated face detectors trained via supervised learning typically rely on
synthesized images from specific generators, limiting their generalization to
emerging generative techniques. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a
self-supervised method based on bi-level optimization. In the inner loop, we
pretrain a vision encoder only on photographic face images using a set of
linearly weighted pretext tasks: classification of categorical exchangeable
image file format (EXIF) tags, ranking of ordinal EXIF tags, and detection of
artificial face manipulations. The outer loop then optimizes the relative
weights of these pretext tasks to enhance the coarse-grained detection of
manipulated faces, serving as a proxy task for identifying AI-generated faces.
In doing so, it aligns self-supervised learning more closely with the ultimate
goal of AI-generated face detection. Once pretrained, the encoder remains
fixed, and AI-generated faces are detected either as anomalies under a Gaussian
mixture model fitted to photographic face features or by a lightweight
two-layer perceptron serving as a binary classifier. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our detectors significantly outperform existing approaches in
both one-class and binary classification settings, exhibiting strong
generalization to unseen generators.

*Qingcheng Zhao,Xiang Zhang,Haiyang Xu,Zeyuan Chen,Jianwen Xie,Yuan Gao,Zhuowen Tu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DepR是一种深度引导的单视角场景重建框架，通过实例级扩散和组合范式生成3D布局。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅利用深度信息进行对象布局估计，未能充分利用其几何信息，DepR旨在通过深度引导的训练和推理改进重建效果。

Method: DepR在训练和推理中均利用深度信息，通过深度引导条件化编码形状先验，并在推理中优化DDIM采样和布局。

Result: DepR在合成和真实数据集上均表现出色，实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DepR通过深度信息的全面利用，显著提升了单视角场景重建的效果和泛化能力。

Abstract: We propose DepR, a depth-guided single-view scene reconstruction framework
that integrates instance-level diffusion within a compositional paradigm.
Instead of reconstructing the entire scene holistically, DepR generates
individual objects and subsequently composes them into a coherent 3D layout.
Unlike previous methods that use depth solely for object layout estimation
during inference and therefore fail to fully exploit its rich geometric
information, DepR leverages depth throughout both training and inference.
Specifically, we introduce depth-guided conditioning to effectively encode
shape priors into diffusion models. During inference, depth further guides DDIM
sampling and layout optimization, enhancing alignment between the
reconstruction and the input image. Despite being trained on limited synthetic
data, DepR achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates strong
generalization in single-view scene reconstruction, as shown through
evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了一种模块化多智能体框架，通过三个阶段（接地、规划和生成）将UI设计自动转换为前端代码，显著提升了布局准确性和代码质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖自然语言提示，难以捕捉空间布局和视觉设计意图，而实际UI开发是多模态的，通常从视觉草图开始。

Method: 采用三阶段框架：接地代理检测并标记UI组件，规划代理构建层次布局，生成代理通过自适应提示合成HTML/CSS代码。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在布局准确性、结构一致性和代码正确性上达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: 该方法通过模块化设计和数据引擎扩展，显著提升了UI到代码生成的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Abstract: Automating the transformation of user interface (UI) designs into front-end
code holds significant promise for accelerating software development and
democratizing design workflows. While recent large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated progress in text-to-code generation, many existing approaches rely
solely on natural language prompts, limiting their effectiveness in capturing
spatial layout and visual design intent. In contrast, UI development in
practice is inherently multimodal, often starting from visual sketches or
mockups. To address this gap, we introduce a modular multi-agent framework that
performs UI-to-code generation in three interpretable stages: grounding,
planning, and generation. The grounding agent uses a vision-language model to
detect and label UI components, the planning agent constructs a hierarchical
layout using front-end engineering priors, and the generation agent produces
HTML/CSS code via adaptive prompt-based synthesis. This design improves
robustness, interpretability, and fidelity over end-to-end black-box methods.
Furthermore, we extend the framework into a scalable data engine that
automatically produces large-scale image-code pairs. Using these synthetic
examples, we fine-tune and reinforce an open-source VLM, yielding notable gains
in UI understanding and code quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in layout accuracy,
structural coherence, and code correctness. Our code is made publicly available
at https://github.com/leigest519/ScreenCoder.

### [65] [CapRecover: A Cross-Modality Feature Inversion Attack Framework on Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22828)
*Kedong Xiu,Saiqian Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CapRecover是一种跨模态反演框架，直接从中间特征恢复高级语义内容（如标签或描述），无需图像重建，解决了视觉语言模型中的语义信息泄漏问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型（VLMs）在分割DNN配置中的部署增加，中间特征的语义信息泄漏风险上升，现有方法重建的图像模糊且语义模糊。

Method: 提出CapRecover框架，通过跨模态反演直接从中间特征恢复语义内容，并引入随机噪声保护方法防止泄漏。

Result: CapRecover在CIFAR-10上达到92.71%的Top-1标签准确率，在COCO2017上生成流畅描述（ROUGE-L达0.52）。

Conclusion: CapRecover有效恢复语义信息，同时提出的噪声保护方法能低成本防止泄漏。

Abstract: As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in split-DNN
configurations--with visual encoders (e.g., ResNet, ViT) operating on user
devices and sending intermediate features to the cloud--there is a growing
privacy risk from semantic information leakage. Existing approaches to
reconstructing images from these intermediate features often result in blurry,
semantically ambiguous images. To directly address semantic leakage, we propose
CapRecover, a cross-modality inversion framework that recovers high-level
semantic content, such as labels or captions, directly from intermediate
features without image reconstruction.
  We evaluate CapRecover on multiple datasets and victim models, demonstrating
strong performance in semantic recovery. Specifically, CapRecover achieves up
to 92.71% Top-1 label accuracy on CIFAR-10 and generates fluent captions from
ResNet50 features on COCO2017 with ROUGE-L scores up to 0.52. Our analysis
further reveals that deeper convolutional layers encode significantly more
semantic information compared to shallow layers. To mitigate semantic leakage,
we introduce a simple yet effective protection method: adding random noise to
intermediate features at each layer and removing the noise in the next layer.
Experimental results show that this approach prevents semantic leakage without
additional training costs.

Result: 在FGVC和VTAB-1k基准测试中，性能分别超过全微调3.40%和10.35%。

Conclusion: TR-PTS通过任务驱动的参数和令牌选择，实现了高效且高性能的微调。

Abstract: Large pre-trained models achieve remarkable performance in vision tasks but
are impractical for fine-tuning due to high computational and storage costs.
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods mitigate this issue by updating
only a subset of parameters; however, most existing approaches are
task-agnostic, failing to fully exploit task-specific adaptations, which leads
to suboptimal efficiency and performance. To address this limitation, we
propose Task-Relevant Parameter and Token Selection (TR-PTS), a task-driven
framework that enhances both computational efficiency and accuracy.
Specifically, we introduce Task-Relevant Parameter Selection, which utilizes
the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) to identify and fine-tune only the most
informative parameters in a layer-wise manner, while keeping the remaining
parameters frozen. Simultaneously, Task-Relevant Token Selection dynamically
preserves the most informative tokens and merges redundant ones, reducing
computational overhead. By jointly optimizing parameters and tokens, TR-PTS
enables the model to concentrate on task-discriminative information. We
evaluate TR-PTS on benchmark, including FGVC and VTAB-1k, where it achieves
state-of-the-art performance, surpassing full fine-tuning by 3.40% and 10.35%,
respectively. The code are available at https://github.com/synbol/TR-PTS.

Result: LCS在五项指标上优于AMD的EASF和FSR1，具有更好的感知质量。

Conclusion: ESR模型在资源受限设备上具有巨大潜力，LCS为游戏渲染提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of content rendering in modern games has led to a
problematic growth in the workload of the GPU. In this paper, we propose an
AI-based low-complexity scaler (LCS) inspired by state-of-the-art efficient
super-resolution (ESR) models which could offload the workload on the GPU to a
low-power device such as a neural processing unit (NPU). The LCS is trained on
GameIR image pairs natively rendered at low and high resolution. We utilize
adversarial training to encourage reconstruction of perceptually important
details, and apply reparameterization and quantization techniques to reduce
model complexity and size. In our comparative analysis we evaluate the LCS
alongside the publicly available AMD hardware-based Edge Adaptive Scaling
Function (EASF) and AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 1 (FSR1) on five different
metrics, and find that the LCS achieves better perceptual quality,
demonstrating the potential of ESR models for upscaling on resource-constrained
devices.

Conclusion: OmniAVS和OISA为多模态音频-视觉分割提供了新基准和解决方案。

Abstract: Referring audio-visual segmentation (RAVS) has recently seen significant

boundaries of RAVS and facilitate future research in this field, we propose
Omnimodal Referring Audio-Visual Segmentation (OmniAVS), a new dataset
containing 2,098 videos and 59,458 multimodal referring expressions. OmniAVS
stands out with three key innovations: (1) 8 types of multimodal expressions
that flexibly combine text, speech, sound, and visual cues; (2) an emphasis on
understanding audio content beyond just detecting their presence; and (3) the
inclusion of complex reasoning and world knowledge in expressions. Furthermore,
we introduce Omnimodal Instructed Segmentation Assistant (OISA), to address the
challenges of multimodal reasoning and fine-grained understanding of

Abstract: This study proposes a deep learning-based framework for automated
segmentation of brain regions and classification of amyloid positivity using
positron emission tomography (PET) images alone, without the need for
structural MRI or CT. A 3D U-Net architecture with four layers of depth was
trained and validated on a dataset of 200 F18-florbetapir amyloid-PET scans,
with an 130/20/50 train/validation/test split. Segmentation performance was
evaluated using Dice similarity coefficients across 30 brain regions, with
scores ranging from 0.45 to 0.88, demonstrating high anatomical accuracy,
particularly in subcortical structures. Quantitative fidelity of PET uptake
within clinically relevant regions. Precuneus, prefrontal cortex, gyrus rectus,
and lateral temporal cortex was assessed using normalized root mean square
error, achieving values as low as 0.0011. Furthermore, the model achieved a
classification accuracy of 0.98 for amyloid positivity based on regional uptake
quantification, with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.99. These results
highlight the model's potential for integration into PET only diagnostic
pipelines, particularly in settings where structural imaging is not available.
This approach reduces dependence on coregistration and manual delineation,
enabling scalable, reliable, and reproducible analysis in clinical and research
applications. Future work will focus on clinical validation and extension to
diverse PET tracers including C11 PiB and other F18 labeled compounds.

Conclusion: 迁移学习是克服fMRI数据解码挑战的有效方法，展示了大规模数据的潜力。

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in neuroscience is to decode mental states from brain
activity. While functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) offers a
non-invasive approach to capture brain-wide neural dynamics with high spatial
precision, decoding from fMRI data -- particularly from task-evoked activity --
remains challenging due to its high dimensionality, low signal-to-noise ratio,
and limited within-subject data. Here, we leverage recent advances in computer
vision and propose STDA-SwiFT, a transformer-based model that learns
transferable representations from large-scale fMRI datasets via
spatial-temporal divided attention and self-supervised contrastive learning.
Using pretrained voxel-wise representations from 995 subjects in the Human
Connectome Project (HCP), we show that our model substantially improves
downstream decoding performance of task-evoked activity across multiple sensory
and cognitive domains, even with minimal data preprocessing. We demonstrate
performance gains from larger receptor fields afforded by our memory-efficient
attention mechanism, as well as the impact of functional relevance in
pretraining data when fine-tuning on small samples. Our work showcases transfer
learning as a viable approach to harness large-scale datasets to overcome
challenges in decoding brain activity from fMRI data.

Conclusion: 该方法提升了用户体验，扩展了应用场景，增强了多媒体系统的可靠性。

Abstract: Video signals are vulnerable in multimedia communication and storage systems,
as even slight bitstream-domain corruption can lead to significant pixel-domain
degradation. To recover faithful spatio-temporal content from corrupted inputs,
bitstream-corrupted video recovery has recently emerged as a challenging and
understudied task. However, existing methods require time-consuming and
labor-intensive annotation of corrupted regions for each corrupted video frame,
resulting in a large workload in practice. In addition, high-quality recovery
remains difficult as part of the local residual information in corrupted frames
may mislead feature completion and successive content recovery. In this paper,
we propose the first blind bitstream-corrupted video recovery framework that
integrates visual foundation models with a recovery model, which is adapted to
different types of corruption and bitstream-level prompts. Within the
framework, the proposed Detect Any Corruption (DAC) model leverages the rich
priors of the visual foundation model while incorporating bitstream and
corruption knowledge to enhance corruption localization and blind recovery.
Additionally, we introduce a novel Corruption-aware Feature Completion (CFC)
module, which adaptively processes residual contributions based on high-level
corruption understanding. With VFM-guided hierarchical feature augmentation and
high-level coordination in a mixture-of-residual-experts (MoRE) structure, our
method suppresses artifacts and enhances informative residuals. Comprehensive
evaluations show that the proposed method achieves outstanding performance in
bitstream-corrupted video recovery without requiring a manually labeled mask
sequence. The demonstrated effectiveness will help to realize improved user
experience, wider application scenarios, and more reliable multimedia
communication and storage systems.

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) designed imaging systems integrate coded optical designs
with decoding algorithms to enhance imaging fidelity for diverse visual tasks.
However, existing E2E designs encounter significant challenges in maintaining
high image fidelity at wide fields of view, due to high computational
complexity, as well as difficulties in modeling off-axis wave propagation while
accounting for off-axis aberrations. In particular, the common approach of
placing the encoding element into the aperture or pupil plane results in only a
global control of the wavefront. To overcome these limitations, this work
explores an additional design choice by positioning a DOE off-aperture,
enabling a spatial unmixing of the degrees of freedom and providing local
control over the wavefront over the image plane. Our approach further leverages
hybrid refractive-diffractive optical systems by linking differentiable ray and
wave optics modeling, thereby optimizing depth imaging quality and
demonstrating system versatility. Experimental results reveal that the
off-aperture DOE enhances the imaging quality by over 5 dB in PSNR at a FoV of
approximately $45^\circ$ when paired with a simple thin lens, outperforming
traditional on-aperture systems. Furthermore, we successfully recover color and
depth information at nearly $28^\circ$ FoV using off-aperture DOE
configurations with compound optics. Physical prototypes for both applications
validate the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed method.

TL;DR: trAIce3D是一种深度学习架构，用于精确分割微胶质细胞的胞体和分支，显著提高了分割精度和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 细胞形状包含其功能的重要信息，但现有分割方法难以处理重叠结构、噪声图像或需要繁琐的超参数调整，限制了临床研究。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：第一阶段使用3D U-Net和视觉变换器检测胞体；第二阶段通过交叉注意力块细化胞体和分支。训练分为自监督的胞体分割和基于提示的分支分割。

Result: 在41,230个微胶质细胞的数据集上，trAIce3D显著提高了分割精度和泛化能力。

Conclusion: trAIce3D不仅适用于微胶质细胞，还可扩展到其他复杂细胞类型，如神经元和星形胶质细胞，对神经生物学研究有广泛影响。

Abstract: The shape of a cell contains essential information about its function within
the biological system. Segmenting these structures from large-scale 3D
microscopy images is challenging, limiting clinical insights especially for
microglia, immune-associated cells involved in neurodegenerative diseases.
Existing segmentation methods mainly focus on cell bodies, struggle with
overlapping structures, perform poorly on noisy images, require hyperparameter
tuning for each new dataset, or rely on tedious semi-automated approaches. We
introduce trAIce3D, a deep-learning architecture designed for precise microglia
segmentation, capturing both somas and branches. It employs a two-stage
approach: first, a 3D U-Net with vision transformers in the encoder detects
somas using a sliding-window technique to cover the entire image. Then, the
same architecture, enhanced with cross-attention blocks in skip connections,
refines each soma and its branches by using soma coordinates as a prompt and a
3D window around the target cell as input. Training occurs in two phases:
self-supervised Soma Segmentation, followed by prompt-based Branch
Segmentation, leveraging pre-trained weights from the first phase. Trained and
evaluated on a dataset of 41,230 microglial cells, trAIce3D significantly
improves segmentation accuracy and generalization, enabling scalable analysis
of complex cellular morphologies. While optimized for microglia, its
architecture can extend to other intricate cell types, such as neurons and
astrocytes, broadening its impact on neurobiological research.

Abstract: Scoliosis is a prevalent condition that impacts both physical health and
appearance, with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) being the most common
form. Currently, the main AIS assessment tool, X-rays, poses significant
limitations, including radiation exposure and limited accessibility in poor and
remote areas. To address this problem, the current solutions are using RGB
images to analyze spine morphology. However, RGB images are highly susceptible
to environmental factors, such as lighting conditions, compromising model
stability and generalizability. Therefore, in this study, we propose a novel
pipeline to accurately estimate the depth information of the unclothed back,
compensating for the limitations of 2D information, and then estimate spine
morphology by integrating both depth and surface information. To capture the
subtle depth variations of the back surface with precision, we design an
adaptive multiscale feature learning network named Grid-Aware Multiscale
Adaptive Network (GAMA-Net). This model uses dual encoders to extract both
patch-level and global features, which are then interacted by the Patch-Based
Hybrid Attention (PBHA) module. The Adaptive Multiscale Feature Fusion (AMFF)
module is used to dynamically fuse information in the decoder. As a result, our
depth estimation model achieves remarkable accuracy across three different
evaluation metrics, with scores of nearly 78.2%, 93.6%, and 97.5%,
respectively. To further validate the effectiveness of the predicted depth, we
integrate both surface and depth information for spine morphology estimation.
This integrated approach enhances the accuracy of spine curve generation,
achieving an impressive performance of up to 97%.

Abstract: Purpose: To develop and optimize a federated learning (FL) framework across
multiple clients for biparametric MRI prostate segmentation and clinically
significant prostate cancer (csPCa) detection. Materials and Methods: A
retrospective study was conducted using Flower FL to train a nnU-Net-based
architecture for MRI prostate segmentation and csPCa detection, using data
collected from January 2010 to August 2021. Model development included training
and optimizing local epochs, federated rounds, and aggregation strategies for
FL-based prostate segmentation on T2-weighted MRIs (four clients, 1294
patients) and csPCa detection using biparametric MRIs (three clients, 1440
patients). Performance was evaluated on independent test sets using the Dice
score for segmentation and the Prostate Imaging: Cancer Artificial Intelligence
(PI-CAI) score, defined as the average of the area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve and average precision, for csPCa detection. P-values for
performance differences were calculated using permutation testing. Results: The
FL configurations were independently optimized for both tasks, showing improved
performance at 1 epoch 300 rounds using FedMedian for prostate segmentation and
5 epochs 200 rounds using FedAdagrad, for csPCa detection. Compared with the
average performance of the clients, the optimized FL model significantly
improved performance in prostate segmentation and csPCa detection on the
independent test set. The optimized FL model showed higher lesion detection
performance compared to the FL-baseline model, but no evidence of a difference
was observed for prostate segmentation. Conclusions: FL enhanced the
performance and generalizability of MRI prostate segmentation and csPCa
detection compared with local models, and optimizing its configuration further
improved lesion detection performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种离散事件建模框架，用于描述地球物理系统通过一系列损伤事件向灾难性破坏的演变过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解地球物理系统中灾难性破坏的前兆信号及其背后的简单机制。

Method: 通过离散事件序列建模，捕捉事件间隔缩短和幅度增大的趋势，揭示有限时间奇点的自然涌现。

Result: 模型揭示了加速应变率、事件频率和能量释放等前兆信号，并与系统刚度演化相关联。

Conclusion: 该框架为解释多种地球物理环境中的破坏前兆提供了统一的概念和定量工具。

Abstract: We develop a discrete-event modeling framework that captures the progression
of geophysical systems toward catastrophic failure through sequences of
distinct damage events. By representing system evolution as a succession of
temporally accelerating and amplitude-varying events, the framework reveals how
finite-time singularities, both logarithmic and power law types, naturally
emerge from the interplay between shrinking interevent intervals and growing
event magnitudes. This event-based perspective provides an intuitive physical
understanding of rupture processes, highlighting how precursory signals such as
accelerating strain rate, event frequency, and energy release can be traced
back to simple underlying mechanisms. A mean-field formulation further links
the observed power law exponents to the evolving stiffness of the system under
constant or time-varying stress. Incorporating stochastic fluctuations, the
model captures the inherent randomness of natural systems leading to the
emergence of stochastic finite-time singular behavior. Altogether, this unified
approach offers a simple conceptual and quantitative tool for interpreting the
lead-up to failure in a wide range of geophysical settings.

Main category: physics.geo-ph

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于一致性模型（CM）的物理约束生成建模框架，用于将低分辨率的格陵兰冰盖表面质量平衡（SMB）和表面温度数据降尺度至高分辨率（从160公里到5公里网格间距），并在测试集上表现优于插值方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前预测格陵兰冰盖表面质量平衡和温度的方法要么计算成本高，要么仅限于粗空间尺度，无法满足对未来海平面上升的精确预测需求。

Method: 采用物理约束的生成建模框架，基于一致性模型（CM），训练于区域气候模型MARv3.12的月度输出数据，并利用冰盖地形和日照条件进行条件约束。在推理过程中强制执行守恒约束，确保粗尺度上的SMB和温度总和近似保持不变。

Result: 在测试集上，约束CM的SMB和表面温度分别达到6.31 mmWE和0.1 K的连续排名概率分数，优于插值方法。此外，空间功率谱分析表明CM能准确再现多尺度变异性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够快速生成高分辨率的气候强迫数据，适用于冰盖模拟，并可集成到地球系统和冰盖模型工作流中，改进格陵兰及其他冰盖和冰川对未来海平面上升贡献的预测。

Abstract: Accurate, high-resolution projections of the Greenland ice sheet's surface
mass balance (SMB) and surface temperature are essential for understanding
future sea-level rise, yet current approaches are either computationally
demanding or limited to coarse spatial scales. Here, we introduce a novel
physics-constrained generative modeling framework based on a consistency model
(CM) to downscale low-resolution SMB and surface temperature fields by a factor
of up to 32 (from 160 km to 5 km grid spacing) in a few sampling steps. The CM
is trained on monthly outputs of the regional climate model MARv3.12 and
conditioned on ice-sheet topography and insolation. By enforcing a hard
conservation constraint during inference, we ensure approximate preservation of
SMB and temperature sums on the coarse spatial scale as well as robust
generalization to extreme climate states without retraining. On the test set,
our constrained CM achieves a continued ranked probability score of 6.31 mmWE
for the SMB and 0.1 K for the surface temperature, outperforming
interpolation-based downscaling. Together with spatial power-spectral analysis,
we demonstrate that the CM faithfully reproduces variability across spatial
scales. We further apply bias-corrected outputs of the NorESM2 Earth System
Model as inputs to our CM, to demonstrate the potential of our model to
directly downscale ESM fields. Our approach delivers realistic, high-resolution
climate forcing for ice-sheet simulations with fast inference and can be
readily integrated into Earth-system and ice-sheet model workflows to improve
projections of the future contribution to sea-level rise from Greenland and
potentially other ice sheets and glaciers too.

Motivation: 解决地球早期磁场与年轻内核之间的矛盾，探索岩浆海洋在早期发电机效应中的作用。

Method: 通过数值模拟研究岩浆海洋与核心的非磁性旋转流动，分析多个无量纲参数对耦合对流的影响。

Result: 岩浆海洋能驱动核心流动，且流动速度与岩浆海洋的努塞尔数呈近似线性关系。核心流动的径向和方位分量相当，可能支持早期发电机效应。

Conclusion: 岩浆海洋驱动的核心流动可能是地球早期磁场的来源，填补了观测与理论之间的空白。

Abstract: Convective flow in Earth's iron-rich liquid core drives self-sustained dynamo
action, generating Earth's magnetic field, which is strongest among all
terrestrial planets of the solar system. Rock records show that this magnetic
field has been operative in Earth for at least 3.4 billion years (b.y).
However, advanced high pressure experiments have revised the value of the
thermal conductivity of the outer core, which implies an age for the inner core
of less than 1 b.y., when compositional convection begins. This creates a
puzzle, with a gap between the observations of an early magnetic field on Earth
and the young inner core. Previous work has suggested that the pre-inner core
dynamo could have been generated in a magma ocean (MO) at the base of the
mantle; however, the fluid dynamics of this scenario have received little
attention. Here we numerically model the non-magnetic rotating flow in a MO
above a convectively stable core in a configuration representing the pre-inner
core days of Earth's evolution. Simulations here explore the importance of
several dimensionless parameters on coupled core-MO convection -- the Rayleigh
number, the ocean/core thermal diffusivity ratio, thermal expansion coefficient
ratio, viscosity ratio, and layer thickness ratio. It is found that the MO can
easily drive a flow of comparable magnitude in the core, and an approximately
linear relationship is observed between the ratio of root-mean-square
velocities in the core and the ocean, $(u_c^{RMS}/u_o^{RMS})$, and $(\Nu_o-1)$,
where $\Nu_o$ is the Nusselt number for the MO, for the $\Nu_o$ of order 1 to
10 considered. Radial and azimuthal components of the core flow are of similar
magnitude, so that, with comparable toroidal and poloidal components, we
speculate that the MO-driven core flow could drive an early dynamo.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于深度学习的去噪自编码器（DAR）方法，用于去除EEG-fMRI同步记录中的MR相关伪影，表现优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG-fMRI同步记录的高时空分辨率受到MR伪影（如梯度伪影和心电伪影）的干扰，限制了其应用。

Method: 使用1D卷积自编码器从噪声信号中学习直接映射到清晰信号，利用CWL EEG-fMRI数据集进行训练和验证。

Result: DAR在RMSE、SSIM和SNR增益上显著优于传统方法（如PCA、ICA等），并通过LOSO验证了模型的泛化能力。

Conclusion: DAR是一种高效且可解释的实时EEG伪影去除方法，适用于EEG-fMRI同步记录。

Abstract: Simultaneous EEG-fMRI recording combines high temporal and spatial resolution
for tracking neural activity. However, its usefulness is greatly limited by
artifacts from magnetic resonance (MR), especially gradient artifacts (GA) and
ballistocardiogram (BCG) artifacts, which interfere with the EEG signal. To
address this issue, we used a denoising autoencoder (DAR), a deep learning
framework designed to reduce MR-related artifacts in EEG recordings. Using
paired data that includes both artifact-contaminated and MR-corrected EEG from
the CWL EEG-fMRI dataset, DAR uses a 1D convolutional autoencoder to learn a
direct mapping from noisy to clear signal segments. Compared to traditional
artifact removal methods like principal component analysis (PCA), independent
component analysis (ICA), average artifact subtraction (AAS), and wavelet
thresholding, DAR shows better performance. It achieves a root-mean-squared
error (RMSE) of 0.0218 $\pm$ 0.0152, a structural similarity index (SSIM) of
0.8885 $\pm$ 0.0913, and a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain of 14.63 dB.
Statistical analysis with paired t-tests confirms that these improvements are
significant (p<0.001; Cohen's d>1.2). A leave-one-subject-out (LOSO)
cross-validation protocol shows that the model generalizes well, yielding an
average RMSE of 0.0635 $\pm$ 0.0110 and an SSIM of 0.6658 $\pm$ 0.0880 across
unseen subjects. Additionally, saliency-based visualizations demonstrate that
DAR highlights areas with dense artifacts, which makes its decisions easier to
interpret. Overall, these results position DAR as a potential and
understandable solution for real-time EEG artifact removal in simultaneous
EEG-fMRI applications.

Abstract: This work is completed on a whim after discussions with my junior colleague.
The motion direction angle affects the micro-Doppler spectrum width, thus
determining the human motion direction can provide important prior information
for downstream tasks such as gait recognition. However, Doppler-Time map
(DTM)-based methods still have room for improvement in achieving feature
augmentation and motion determination simultaneously. In response, a low-cost
but accurate radar-based human motion direction determination (HMDD) method is
explored in this paper. In detail, the radar-based human gait DTMs are first
generated, and then the feature augmentation is achieved using feature linking
model. Subsequently, the HMDD is implemented through a lightweight and fast
Vision Transformer-Convolutional Neural Network hybrid model structure. The
effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through open-source dataset.

Conclusion: T-MIFPE通过优化浮点误差显著提升了对抗攻击的准确性和鲁棒性评估效果。

Abstract: Gradient-based adversarial attacks using the Cross-Entropy (CE) loss often
suffer from overestimation due to relative errors in gradient computation
induced by floating-point arithmetic. This paper provides a rigorous
theoretical analysis of these errors, conducting the first comprehensive study
of floating-point computation errors in gradient-based attacks across four
distinct scenarios: (i) unsuccessful untargeted attacks, (ii) successful
untargeted attacks, (iii) unsuccessful targeted attacks, and (iv) successful
targeted attacks. We establish theoretical foundations characterizing the
behavior of relative numerical errors under different attack conditions,
revealing previously unknown patterns in gradient computation instability, and
identify floating-point underflow and rounding as key contributors. Building on
this insight, we propose the Theoretical MIFPE (T-MIFPE) loss function, which
incorporates an optimal scaling factor $T = t^*$ to minimize the impact of
floating-point errors, thereby enhancing the accuracy of gradient computation
in adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and
CIFAR-100 datasets demonstrate that T-MIFPE outperforms existing loss
functions, including CE, C\&W, DLR, and MIFPE, in terms of attack potency and
robustness evaluation accuracy.

Conclusion: RCR-AF通过理论指导和实验验证，显著提升了模型的对抗鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Despite their widespread success, deep neural networks remain critically
vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing significant risks in safety-sensitive
applications. This paper investigates activation functions as a crucial yet
underexplored component for enhancing model robustness. We propose a Rademacher
Complexity Reduction Activation Function (RCR-AF), a novel activation function
designed to improve both generalization and adversarial resilience. RCR-AF
uniquely combines the advantages of GELU (including smoothness, gradient
stability, and negative information retention) with ReLU's desirable
monotonicity, while simultaneously controlling both model sparsity and capacity
through built-in clipping mechanisms governed by two hyperparameters, $\alpha$
and $\gamma$. Our theoretical analysis, grounded in Rademacher complexity,
demonstrates that these parameters directly modulate the model's Rademacher
complexity, offering a principled approach to enhance robustness. Comprehensive
empirical evaluations show that RCR-AF consistently outperforms widely-used
alternatives (ReLU, GELU, and Swish) in both clean accuracy under standard
training and in adversarial robustness within adversarial training paradigms.

Motivation: 由于深度神经网络在边缘设备上的计算负载过重，需要高效的压缩技术来部署模型。

Method: 结合分数阶微分和高斯函数构建分数阶高斯滤波器（FGFs），并引入Grünwald-Letnikov分数阶导数降低计算复杂度。同时采用自适应非结构化剪枝（AUP）进一步提高压缩率。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上，ResNet-20精度仅下降1.52%，模型体积减少85.2%；在ImageNet2012上，ResNet-50精度仅下降1.63%，模型体积减少69.1%。

Conclusion: FGFP框架在精度和压缩率上优于现有方法，适用于边缘设备部署。

Abstract: Network compression techniques have become increasingly important in recent
years because the loads of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are heavy for edge
devices in real-world applications. While many methods compress neural network
parameters, deploying these models on edge devices remains challenging. To
address this, we propose the fractional Gaussian filter and pruning (FGFP)
framework, which integrates fractional-order differential calculus and Gaussian
function to construct fractional Gaussian filters (FGFs). To reduce the
computational complexity of fractional-order differential operations, we
introduce Gr\"unwald-Letnikov fractional derivatives to approximate the
fractional-order differential equation. The number of parameters for each
kernel in FGF is minimized to only seven. Beyond the architecture of Fractional
Gaussian Filters, our FGFP framework also incorporates Adaptive Unstructured
Pruning (AUP) to achieve higher compression ratios. Experiments on various
architectures and benchmarks show that our FGFP framework outperforms recent
methods in accuracy and compression. On CIFAR-10, ResNet-20 achieves only a
1.52% drop in accuracy while reducing the model size by 85.2%. On ImageNet2012,
ResNet-50 achieves only a 1.63% drop in accuracy while reducing the model size
by 69.1%.

Abstract: In this paper we argue that ReLU networks learn an implicit linear model we

can approximately pull its decision boundary back to the input space with
certain simple modification to the backward pass. The resulting gradients
(called excitation pullbacks) reveal high-resolution input- and target-specific
features of remarkable perceptual alignment on a number of popular
ImageNet-pretrained deep architectures. This strongly suggests that neural
networks do, in fact, rely on learned interpretable patterns that can be
recovered after training. Thus, our findings may have profound implications for
knowledge discovery and the development of dependable artificial systems.

different perceptions of reality. However, adversaries may misuse such
techniques to generate hateful illusions, which embed specific hate messages
into harmless scenes and disseminate them across web communities. In this work,
we take the first step toward investigating the risks of scalable hateful
illusion generation and the potential for bypassing current content moderation
models. Specifically, we generate 1,860 optical illusions using Stable
Diffusion and ControlNet, conditioned on 62 hate messages. Of these, 1,571 are
hateful illusions that successfully embed hate messages, either overtly or
subtly, forming the Hateful Illusion dataset. Using this dataset, we evaluate
the performance of six moderation classifiers and nine vision language models
(VLMs) in identifying hateful illusions. Experimental results reveal
significant vulnerabilities in existing moderation models: the detection
accuracy falls below 0.245 for moderation classifiers and below 0.102 for VLMs.
We further identify a critical limitation in their vision encoders, which
mainly focus on surface-level image details while overlooking the secondary
layer of information, i.e., hidden messages. To address this risk, we explore
preliminary mitigation measures and identify the most effective approaches from
the perspectives of image transformations and training-level strategies.

### [87] [The Effect of Pattern Quality on Measurements of Stress Heterogeneity and Geometrically Necessary Dislocation Density by High-Angular Resolution Electron Backscatter Diffraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22745)
*Harison S. Wiesman,David Wallis*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: 研究探讨了图案质量对高角度分辨电子背散射衍射（HR-EBSD）分析结果的影响，发现增加帧平均可减少噪声并揭示更多亚结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究图案质量（以带对比度为指标）对HR-EBSD分析结果的影响，特别是对内部应力异质性和几何必要位错（GND）密度的影响。

Method: 通过调整每幅电子背散射图案的平均帧数（1至30帧）来改变带对比度，对同一变形橄榄石样品区域进行六次映射，并分析其HR-EBSD数据。

Result: 增加帧平均显著降低了低带对比度像素的噪声，揭示了更多亚结构；高带对比度区域受影响较小。应力分布概率变窄，高应力噪声减少。

Conclusion: 帧平均可提升HR-EBSD分析质量，但需确保比较的数据集具有相似的平均带对比度，以避免数据采集差异导致的假象。

Abstract: We examine the effect of pattern quality on the output of high-angular
resolution electron backscatter diffraction (HR-EBSD) analyses. Band contrast,
as a proxy for pattern quality, was varied by adjusting the number of frames
averaged per electron backscatter pattern during data collection. The same
region in a deformed sample of the mineral olivine was mapped six times varying
the number of frames averaged between 1 and 30 between each map. Each data set
was analyzed with HR-EBSD, producing maps of intragranular stress heterogeneity
and geometrically necessary dislocation (GND) density. As the number of frames
averaged increased, the noise in stress and GND calculations decreased,
revealing more substructure in the mapped region. The worst pixels, with low
band contrast, are the most improved by increased frame averaging, whereas
those with high band contrast are largely unaffected. Additionally, the
probability distribution of stresses narrows as high-stress noise is reduced
with increased pattern quality, which also affects estimates of dislocation
density from statistical analysis of the stress distributions. As regions with
high stress and/or high GND density are typically of interest in HR-EBSD maps
and are often associated with low band contrast, frame averaging may be used as
a tool to improve the quality of these analyses. Most importantly, however, is
that comparisons are made between HR-EBSD datasets with similar mean band
contrast to ensure that observed differences are microstructural in origin and
not an artefact of data collection.

Abstract: Computational pathology (CPath) has shown great potential in mining
actionable insights from Whole Slide Images (WSIs). Deep Learning (DL) has been
at the center of modern CPath, and while it delivers unprecedented performance,
it is also known that DL may be affected by irrelevant details, such as those
introduced during scanning by different commercially available scanners. This
may lead to scanner bias, where the model outputs for the same tissue acquired
by different scanners may vary. In turn, it hinders the trust of clinicians in
CPath-based tools and their deployment in real-world clinical practices. Recent
pathology Foundation Models (FMs) promise to provide better domain
generalization capabilities. In this paper, we benchmark FMs using a
multi-scanner dataset and show that FMs still suffer from scanner bias.
Following this observation, we propose ScanGen, a contrastive loss function
applied during task-specific fine-tuning that mitigates scanner bias, thereby
enhancing the models' robustness to scanner variations. Our approach is applied
to the Multiple Instance Learning task of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor
(EGFR) mutation prediction from H\&E-stained WSIs in lung cancer. We observe
that ScanGen notably enhances the ability to generalize across scanners, while
retaining or improving the performance of EGFR mutation prediction.

Abstract: The rapid development of AR/VR, remote sensing, satellite radar, and medical
equipment has created an imperative demand for ultra efficient image
compression and reconstruction that exceed the capabilities of electronic
processors. For the first time, we demonstrate an end to end image compression
and reconstruction approach using an optoelectronic computing
processor,achieving orders of magnitude higher speed and lower energy
consumption than electronic counterparts. At its core is a 32X32 silicon
photonic computing chip, which monolithically integrates 32 high speed
modulators, 32 detectors, and a programmable photonic matrix core, copackaged
with all necessary control electronics (TIA, ADC, DAC, FPGA etc.). Leveraging
the photonic matrix core programmability, the processor generates trainable
compressive matrices, enabling adjustable image compression ratios (from 2X to
256X) to meet diverse application needs. Deploying a custom lightweight
photonic integrated circuit oriented network (LiPICO-Net) enables high quality
reconstruction of compressed images. Our approach delivers an end to end
latency of only 49.5ps/pixel while consuming only less than 10.6nJ/pixel-both
metrics representing 2-3 orders of magnitude improvement compared with
classical models running on state-of-the-art GPUs. We validate the system on a
130 million-pixel aerial imagery, enabling real time compression where
electronic systems falter due to power and latency constraints. This work not
only provides a transformative solution for massive image processing but also
opens new avenues for photonic computing applications.

Abstract: Computer-generated holography (CGH) represents a transformative visualization
approach for next-generation immersive virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR)
displays, enabling precise wavefront modulation and naturally providing
comprehensive physiological depth cues without the need for bulky optical
assemblies. Despite significant advancements in computational algorithms
enhancing image quality and achieving real-time generation, practical
implementations of holographic near-eye displays (NEDs) continue to face
substantial challenges arising from finite and dynamically varying pupil
apertures, which degrade image quality and compromise user experience. In this
study, we introduce an eyepiece-free pupil-optimized holographic NED. Our
proposed method employs a customized spherical phase modulation strategy to
generate multiple viewpoints within the pupil, entirely eliminating the
dependence on conventional optical eyepieces. Through the joint optimization of
amplitude and phase distributions across these viewpoints, the method markedly
mitigates image degradation due to finite pupil sampling and resolves
inapparent depth cues induced by the spherical phase. The demonstrated method
signifies a substantial advancement toward the realization of compact,
lightweight, and flexible holographic NED systems, fulfilling stringent
requirements for future VR/AR display technologies.

Abstract: Dental crowns are essential dental treatments for restoring damaged or
missing teeth of patients. Recent design approaches of dental crowns are
carried out using commercial dental design software. Once a scan of a
preparation is uploaded to the software, a dental technician needs to manually
define a precise margin line on the preparation surface, which constitutes a
non-repeatable and inconsistent procedure. This work proposes a new framework
to determine margin lines automatically and accurately using deep learning. A
dataset of incisor teeth was provided by a collaborating dental laboratory to
train a deep learning segmentation model. A mesh-based neural network was
modified by changing its input channels and used to segment the prepared tooth
into two regions such that the margin line is contained within the boundary
faces separating the two regions. Next, k-fold cross-validation was used to
train 5 models, and a voting classifier technique was used to combine their
results to enhance the segmentation. After that, boundary smoothing and
optimization using the graph cut method were applied to refine the segmentation
results. Then, boundary faces separating the two regions were selected to
represent the margin line faces. A spline was approximated to best fit the
centers of the boundary faces to predict the margin line. Our results show that
an ensemble model combined with maximum probability predicted the highest
number of successful test cases (7 out of 13) based on a maximum distance
threshold of 200 m (representing human error) between the predicted and ground
truth point clouds. It was also demonstrated that the better the quality of the
preparation, the smaller the divergence between the predicted and ground truth
margin lines (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of -0.683). We provide
the train and test datasets for the community.
