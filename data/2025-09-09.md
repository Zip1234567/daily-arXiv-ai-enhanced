### [1] [Label Smoothing++: Enhanced Label Regularization for Training Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05307)
*Sachin Chhabra,Hemanth Venkateswara,Baoxin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Label Smoothing++是一种改进的标签正则化方法，通过为非目标类别分配非零概率并考虑类间关系，解决了传统标签平滑破坏类间关系的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的标签平滑方法虽然能改善神经网络泛化能力，但为所有非目标类别分配相同概率，破坏了类间关系，需要更智能的标签正则化策略。

Method: 提出Label Smoothing++方法，为目标类别使用固定标签，同时让网络学习非目标类别的标签，保持非零概率分配并考虑类间关系。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，该方法能有效缓解过拟合预测，同时促进类间关系和泛化能力。

Conclusion: Label Smoothing++是一种有效的标签正则化策略，在保持泛化能力的同时更好地保持了类间关系。

Abstract: Training neural networks with one-hot target labels often results in
overconfidence and overfitting. Label smoothing addresses this issue by
perturbing the one-hot target labels by adding a uniform probability vector to
create a regularized label. Although label smoothing improves the network's
generalization ability, it assigns equal importance to all the non-target
classes, which destroys the inter-class relationships. In this paper, we
propose a novel label regularization training strategy called Label
Smoothing++, which assigns non-zero probabilities to non-target classes and
accounts for their inter-class relationships. Our approach uses a fixed label
for the target class while enabling the network to learn the labels associated
with non-target classes. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, we
demonstrate how Label Smoothing++ mitigates overconfident predictions while
promoting inter-class relationships and generalization capabilities.

Result: 实证研究表明VILOD使模型状态和数据集特征更易解释，不同可视化引导的标注策略能达到与自动化不确定性采样相当的检测性能。

Conclusion: VILOD工具使目标检测的人机协作主动学习工作流更加透明、可管理且可能更有效，为人机协作标注提供了新工具和实证见解。

Abstract: The advancement of Object Detection (OD) using Deep Learning (DL) is often
hindered by the significant challenge of acquiring large, accurately labeled
datasets, a process that is time-consuming and expensive. While techniques like
Active Learning (AL) can reduce annotation effort by intelligently querying
informative samples, they often lack transparency, limit the strategic insight
of human experts, and may overlook informative samples not aligned with an
employed query strategy. To mitigate these issues, Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)
approaches integrating human intelligence and intuition throughout the machine
learning life-cycle have gained traction. Leveraging Visual Analytics (VA),
effective interfaces can be created to facilitate this human-AI collaboration.
This thesis explores the intersection of these fields by developing and
investigating "VILOD: A Visual Interactive Labeling tool for Object Detection".
VILOD utilizes components such as a t-SNE projection of image features,
together with uncertainty heatmaps and model state views. Enabling users to
explore data, interpret model states, AL suggestions, and implement diverse
sample selection strategies within an iterative HITL workflow for OD. An
empirical investigation using comparative use cases demonstrated how VILOD,
through its interactive visualizations, facilitates the implementation of
distinct labeling strategies by making the model's state and dataset
characteristics more interpretable (RQ1). The study showed that different
visually-guided labeling strategies employed within VILOD result in competitive
OD performance trajectories compared to an automated uncertainty sampling AL
baseline (RQ2). This work contributes a novel tool and empirical insight into
making the HITL-AL workflow for OD annotation more transparent, manageable, and
potentially more effective.

### [3] [Context-Aware Knowledge Distillation with Adaptive Weighting for Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05319)
*Zhengda Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自适应性知识蓄米（AKD）框架，通过动态调整硬标签和软标签捐失的平衡因子，充分利用教师-学生模型间的差异来提升知识蓄米效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识蓄米使用固定的平衡因子alpha来结合硬标签和软标签捐失，但这种静态设置是次优的，因为最佳的相对权重在训练过程中可能会发生变化。

Method: 1）将alpha作为可学习参数在训练中自动优化
2）提出公式根据学生-教师差异动态计算alpha
3）使用MLP + Attention的上下文感知模块（CAM）来适应地重新调整类别级别的教师输出

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上，以ResNet-50为教师模型和ResNet-18为学生模型进行实验，该方法比固定权重的知识蓄米基线获得了更高的准确率，并产生了更稳定的收敛效果。

Conclusion: 自适应性知识蓄米框架通过动态调整捐失权重，能够更有效地利用教师-学生模型间的差异信息，显著提升了知识蓄米的性能和稳定性。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a widely used technique to transfer knowledge
from a large teacher network to a smaller student model. Traditional KD uses a
fixed balancing factor alpha as a hyperparameter to combine the hard-label
cross-entropy loss with the soft-label distillation loss. However, a static
alpha is suboptimal because the optimal trade-off between hard and soft
supervision can vary during training.
  In this work, we propose an Adaptive Knowledge Distillation (AKD) framework.
First we try to make alpha as learnable parameter that can be automatically
learned and optimized during training. Then we introduce a formula to reflect
the gap between the student and the teacher to compute alpha dynamically,
guided by student-teacher discrepancies, and further introduce a Context-Aware
Module (CAM) using MLP + Attention to adaptively reweight class-wise teacher
outputs. Experiments on CIFAR-10 with ResNet-50 as teacher and ResNet-18 as
student demonstrate that our approach achieves superior accuracy compared to
fixed-weight KD baselines, and yields more stable convergence.

advancing multimodal research. This framework offers novel tools for emotion
analysis, data augmentation, and brain-computer interface applications, with
substantial research and engineering significance.

### [5] [Application of discrete Ricci curvature in pruning randomly wired neural networks: A case study with chest x-ray classification of COVID-19](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05322)
*Pavithra Elumalai,Sudharsan Vijayaraghavan,Madhumita Mondal,Areejit Samal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究比较了三种边中心网络度量（FRC、ORC、EBC）在随机有线神经网络剪枝中的效果，发现计算效率更高的FRC能达到与ORC相当的剪枝性能，同时显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索不同网络拓扑结构对深度学习性能的影响，寻找高效的神经网络剪枝方法，特别是在计算复杂度与剪枝效果之间寻求平衡。

Method: 使用三种边中心网络度量（Forman-Ricci曲率、Ollivier-Ricci曲率、边介数中心性）对三种随机网络生成器（ER、WS、BA模型）生成的RWNN进行剪枝，并在COVID-19胸部X光图像分类任务上评估性能。

Result: FRC基于剪枝能有效简化RWNN，在保持与ORC相当性能的同时提供显著的计算优势，压缩后的网络在模块化和全局效率之间展现出权衡关系。

Conclusion: 计算效率更高的FRC可以作为ORC的有效替代方案进行神经网络剪枝，为网络压缩提供了新的有效工具，同时揭示了压缩网络中模块化分离与网络效率之间的权衡关系。

Abstract: Randomly Wired Neural Networks (RWNNs) serve as a valuable testbed for
investigating the impact of network topology in deep learning by capturing how
different connectivity patterns impact both learning efficiency and model
performance. At the same time, they provide a natural framework for exploring
edge-centric network measures as tools for pruning and optimization. In this
study, we investigate three edge-centric network measures: Forman-Ricci
curvature (FRC), Ollivier-Ricci curvature (ORC), and edge betweenness
centrality (EBC), to compress RWNNs by selectively retaining important synapses
(or edges) while pruning the rest. As a baseline, RWNNs are trained for
COVID-19 chest x-ray image classification, aiming to reduce network complexity
while preserving performance in terms of accuracy, specificity, and
sensitivity. We extend prior work on pruning RWNN using ORC by incorporating
two additional edge-centric measures, FRC and EBC, across three network
generators: Erd\"{o}s-R\'{e}nyi (ER) model, Watts-Strogatz (WS) model, and
Barab\'{a}si-Albert (BA) model. We provide a comparative analysis of the
pruning performance of the three measures in terms of compression ratio and
theoretical speedup. A central focus of our study is to evaluate whether FRC,
which is computationally more efficient than ORC, can achieve comparable
pruning effectiveness. Along with performance evaluation, we further
investigate the structural properties of the pruned networks through modularity
and global efficiency, offering insights into the trade-off between modular
segregation and network efficiency in compressed RWNNs. Our results provide
initial evidence that FRC-based pruning can effectively simplify RWNNs,
offering significant computational advantages while maintaining performance
comparable to ORC.

Result: 开发了一个专门用于经典细声部分赛乐谱的OMR模型，并公开释放了所有代码、数据和模型

Conclusion: 该研究为手写经典细声部分赛乐谱的光学识别提供了重要的数据集和技术方案，有助于推动这一领域的发展

Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenge of Optical Music Recognition (OMR)
for handwritten jazz lead sheets, a widely used musical score type that encodes
melody and chords. The task is challenging due to the presence of chords, a
score component not handled by existing OMR systems, and the high variability
and quality issues associated with handwritten images. Our contribution is
two-fold. We present a novel dataset consisting of 293 handwritten jazz lead
sheets of 163 unique pieces, amounting to 2021 total staves aligned with
Humdrum **kern and MusicXML ground truth scores. We also supply synthetic score
images generated from the ground truth. The second contribution is the
development of an OMR model for jazz lead sheets. We discuss specific
tokenisation choices related to our kind of data, and the advantages of using
synthetic scores and pretrained models. We publicly release all code, data, and
models.

### [7] [RT-VLM: Re-Thinking Vision Language Model with 4-Clues for Real-World Object Recognition Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05333)
*Junghyun Park,Tuan Anh Nguyen,Dugki Min*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RT-VLM框架通过合成数据集和两阶段自校正机制，有效提升目标识别模型在域偏移下的鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实部署中目标识别模型面临多种域偏移导致准确率严重下降，包括图像统计特征变化、姿态视角变化、部分遮挡和类别混淆等问题

Method: 构建合成数据集生成管道产生带有"4线索"标注的图像，对Llama 3.2 11B Vision Instruct进行参数高效监督调优，推理时采用两阶段重思考机制：首先生成四个线索，然后作为证据重新检查并迭代修正

Result: 在隔离单个域偏移的鲁棒性基准测试中，RT-VLM持续超越强基线模型

Conclusion: 结构化多模态证据与显式自批判循环的结合是实现可靠和可迁移视觉理解的有前景路径

Abstract: Real world deployments often expose modern object recognition models to
domain shifts that precipitate a severe drop in accuracy. Such shifts encompass
(i) variations in low level image statistics, (ii) changes in object pose and
viewpoint, (iii) partial occlusion, and (iv) visual confusion across adjacent
classes. To mitigate this degradation, we introduce the Re-Thinking Vision
Language Model (RT-VLM) framework. The foundation of this framework is a unique
synthetic dataset generation pipeline that produces images annotated with
"4-Clues": precise bounding boxes, class names, detailed object-level captions,
and a comprehensive context-level caption for the entire scene. We then perform
parameter efficient supervised tuning of Llama 3.2 11B Vision Instruct on this
resource. At inference time, a two stage Re-Thinking scheme is executed: the
model first emits its own four clues, then re examines these responses as
evidence and iteratively corrects them. Across robustness benchmarks that
isolate individual domain shifts, RT-VLM consistently surpasses strong
baselines. These findings indicate that the integration of structured
multimodal evidence with an explicit self critique loop constitutes a promising
route toward reliable and transferable visual understanding.

TL;DR: 开发基于智能手机的低成本羽毛球杀球速度测量系统，使用YOLOv5检测羽毛球和卡尔曼滤波跟踪轨迹，通过视频运动学方法自动计算速度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统运动性能测量技术昂贵复杂，业余和休闲玩家难以获得，需要为羽毛球这项流行运动提供低成本、易用的性能分析方案

Method: 使用定制训练的YOLOv5模型进行羽毛球检测，结合卡尔曼滤波进行鲁棒轨迹跟踪，采用基于视频的运动学速度估计方法进行时空缩放计算速度

Result: 开发出完整的移动应用程序，能够从标准视频录制中自动计算羽毛球速度

Conclusion: 该系统实现了高性能分析技术的民主化，使各级别球员都能分析和改进技术

Abstract: Performance metrics in sports, such as shot speed and angle, provide crucial
feedback for athlete development. However, the technology to capture these
metrics has historically been expensive, complex, and largely inaccessible to
amateur and recreational players. This paper addresses this gap in the context
of badminton, one of the world's most popular sports, by introducing a novel,
cost-effective, and user-friendly system for measuring smash speed using
ubiquitous smartphone technology. Our approach leverages a custom-trained
YOLOv5 model for shuttlecock detection, combined with a Kalman filter for
robust trajectory tracking. By implementing a video-based kinematic speed
estimation method with spatiotemporal scaling, the system automatically
calculates the shuttlecock's velocity from a standard video recording. The
entire process is packaged into an intuitive mobile application, democratizing
access to high-level performance analytics and empowering players at all levels
to analyze and improve their game.

*Zebo Xu,Shaoyun Yu,Mark Torrance,Guido Nottbusch,Nan Zhao,Zhenguang Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究构建了一个大规模中文手写数据库和升级版OpenHandWrite_Toolbox工具包，通过回归分析发现正字法和语音学因素在汉字、部首和笔画三个层次对手写准备和执行都有影响，且呈现层级衰减效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决中文手写研究中语言成分（音韵、语义、正字法系统）在字符、部首和笔画层次如何调节手写的机制问题，以及缺乏细粒度手写数据采集和批量处理工具的问题。

Method: 构建包含42名中文母语者每人书写1200个汉字的大规模手写数据库，升级OpenHandWrite_Toolbox工具包用于实验设计修改、笔画级轨迹采集和批量处理手写测量指标（延迟、时长、笔压等），采用多元回归分析方法。

Result: 正字法预测因子在字符、部首和笔画三个层次都影响手写准备和执行；语音学因素在所有三个层次也影响执行过程；词汇效应呈现层级衰减模式：字符层最显著，部首层次之，笔画层最弱。

Conclusion: 手写在部首和笔画层次的准备和执行与语言成分密切相关，该数据库和工具箱为未来心理语言学和神经语言学研究提供了宝贵资源。

Abstract: Understanding what linguistic components (e.g., phonological, semantic, and
orthographic systems) modulate Chinese handwriting at the character, radical,
and stroke levels remains an important yet understudied topic. Additionally,
there is a lack of comprehensive tools for capturing and batch-processing
fine-grained handwriting data. To address these issues, we constructed a
large-scale handwriting database in which 42 Chinese speakers for each
handwriting 1200 characters in a handwriting-to-dictation task. Additionally,
we enhanced the existing handwriting package and provided comprehensive
documentation for the upgraded OpenHandWrite_Toolbox, which can easily modify
the experimental design, capture the stroke-level handwriting trajectory, and
batch-process handwriting measurements (e.g., latency, duration, and
pen-pressure). In analysing our large-scale database, multiple regression
results show that orthographic predictors impact handwriting preparation and
execution across character, radical, and stroke levels. Phonological factors
also influence execution at all three levels. Importantly, these lexical
effects demonstrate hierarchical attenuation - they were most pronounced at the
character level, followed by the radical, and were weakest at the stroke
levels. These findings demonstrate that handwriting preparation and execution
at the radical and stroke levels are closely intertwined with linguistic
components. This database and toolbox offer valuable resources for future
psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic research on the handwriting of characters
and sub-characters across different languages.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合动态图神经网络和LSTM的混合模型，用于预测跌倒事件，通过解耦运动预测和步态分类任务实现高精度早期跌倒检测


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注跌倒检测，但跌倒发生前的预测以及稳定状态与即将跌倒之间的瞬态状态分析尚未探索，这对于辅助机器人系统至关重要

Method: 使用混合模型：DGNN作为分类器区分稳定、瞬态和跌倒三种步态状态，LSTM网络预测后续时间步的人类运动。从视频序列中提取实时骨骼特征作为输入

Result: 在OUMVLP-Pose和URFD数据集上训练验证，相比仅使用DGNN的模型和文献中的模型，在预测误差和识别准确率方面表现出优越性能

Conclusion: 解耦预测和分类任务相比使用单一DGNN解决统一问题能提高性能，同时可以监测瞬态状态，为高级辅助系统功能增强提供有价值见解

Abstract: Detecting and preventing falls in humans is a critical component of assistive
robotic systems. While significant progress has been made in detecting falls,
the prediction of falls before they happen, and analysis of the transient state
between stability and an impending fall remain unexplored. In this paper, we
propose a anticipatory fall detection method that utilizes a hybrid model
combining Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (DGNN) with Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) networks that decoupled the motion prediction and gait classification
tasks to anticipate falls with high accuracy. Our approach employs real-time
skeletal features extracted from video sequences as input for the proposed
model. The DGNN acts as a classifier, distinguishing between three gait states:
stable, transient, and fall. The LSTM-based network then predicts human
movement in subsequent time steps, enabling early detection of falls. The
proposed model was trained and validated using the OUMVLP-Pose and URFD
datasets, demonstrating superior performance in terms of prediction error and
recognition accuracy compared to models relying solely on DGNN and models from
literature. The results indicate that decoupling prediction and classification
improves performance compared to addressing the unified problem using only the
DGNN. Furthermore, our method allows for the monitoring of the transient state,
offering valuable insights that could enhance the functionality of advanced
assistance systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文通过对比K-Means和FCM算法在脑部脾瘤MRI分割中的表现，发现K-Means计算更快（平均0.3s），而FCM分割精度更高（DSC 0.67 vs 0.43），但计算成本更高


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑部脾瘤的异质性和强度分布不均匀使得MRI分割面临重大挑战，准确的脾瘤边界划分对临床决策、放疗计划和疾病监测至关重要

Method: 使用BraTS2020数据集，通过高斯滤波和CLAHE预处理，对比分析硬聚类(K-Means)和软聚类(FCM)两种聚类方法在脾瘤分割中的性能

Result: K-Means平均运行时间0.3s，DSC指标0.43；FCM平均运行时间1.3s，DSC指标0.67，显示了计算效率与边界精度之间的特征军交换

Conclusion: 硬聚类在计算效率上优势明显，而软聚类在分割准确性方面更优，临床应用中需根据具体需求在运算速度和分割质量之间做出适当选择

Abstract: Segmentation of brain tumors from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remains a
pivotal challenge in medical image analysis due to the heterogeneous nature of
tumor morphology and intensity distributions. Accurate delineation of tumor
boundaries is critical for clinical decision-making, radiotherapy planning, and
longitudinal disease monitoring. In this study, we perform a comprehensive
comparative analysis of two major clustering paradigms applied in MRI tumor
segmentation: hard clustering, exemplified by the K-Means algorithm, and soft
clustering, represented by Fuzzy C-Means (FCM). While K-Means assigns each
pixel strictly to a single cluster, FCM introduces partial memberships, meaning
each pixel can belong to multiple clusters with varying degrees of association.
Experimental validation was performed using the BraTS2020 dataset,
incorporating pre-processing through Gaussian filtering and Contrast Limited
Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE). Evaluation metrics included the Dice
Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and processing time, which collectively
demonstrated that K-Means achieved superior speed with an average runtime of
0.3s per image, whereas FCM attained higher segmentation accuracy with an
average DSC of 0.67 compared to 0.43 for K-Means, albeit at a higher
computational cost (1.3s per image). These results highlight the inherent
trade-off between computational efficiency and boundary precision.

Abstract: Accurate classification of pests and diseases plays a vital role in precision
agriculture, enabling efficient identification, targeted interventions, and
preventing their further spread. However, current methods primarily focus on
binary classification, which limits their practical applications, especially in
scenarios where accurately identifying the specific type of disease or pest is
essential. We propose a robust deep learning based model for multi-class
classification of onion crop diseases and pests. We enhance a pre-trained
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model by integrating attention based modules
and employing comprehensive data augmentation pipeline to mitigate class
imbalance. We propose a model which gives 96.90% overall accuracy and 0.96 F1
score on real-world field image dataset. This model gives better results than
other approaches using the same datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DVRF是一种基于蒸馏的无反演图像编辑框架，通过显式建模源和目标速度场差异来减少过平滑伪影，并引入时间相关偏移项来增强目标分布对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有蒸馏采样方法中普遍存在的过平滑伪影问题，提升文本到图像编辑的质量和保真度。

Method: 提出Delta Velocity Rectified Flow框架，通过建模速度场差异和使用时间相关偏移项来优化编辑过程，无需架构修改。

Result: 实验结果表明DVRF在编辑质量、保真度和可控性方面表现优异，且具有高效性和广泛适用性。

Conclusion: DVRF成功连接了基于分数的扩散优化和基于速度的整流流优化，为FlowEdit等方法提供了理论解释，是文本到图像编辑的有效解决方案。

Abstract: We propose Delta Velocity Rectified Flow (DVRF), a novel inversion-free,
path-aware editing framework within rectified flow models for text-to-image
editing. DVRF is a distillation-based method that explicitly models the
discrepancy between the source and target velocity fields in order to mitigate
over-smoothing artifacts rampant in prior distillation sampling approaches. We
further introduce a time-dependent shift term to push noisy latents closer to
the target trajectory, enhancing the alignment with the target distribution. We
theoretically demonstrate that when this shift is disabled, DVRF reduces to
Delta Denoising Score, thereby bridging score-based diffusion optimization and
velocity-based rectified-flow optimization. Moreover, when the shift term
follows a linear schedule under rectified-flow dynamics, DVRF generalizes the
Inversion-free method FlowEdit and provides a principled theoretical
interpretation for it. Experimental results indicate that DVRF achieves
superior editing quality, fidelity, and controllability while requiring no
architectural modifications, making it efficient and broadly applicable to
text-to-image editing tasks. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN难以捕捉医学影像中细粒度和复杂的关键特征，限制了诊断准确性。需要增强模型对显著区域的关注能力。

Method: 在VGG16、ResNet18、InceptionV3、DenseNet121和EfficientNetB5五种CNN架构中集成Squeeze and Excitation块或混合卷积块注意力模块，实现通道和空间特征的自适应重新校准。

Abstract: Deep learning has become a powerful tool for medical image analysis; however,
conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) often fail to capture the
fine-grained and complex features critical for accurate diagnosis. To address
this limitation, we systematically integrate attention mechanisms into five
widely adopted CNN architectures, namely, VGG16, ResNet18, InceptionV3,
DenseNet121, and EfficientNetB5, to enhance their ability to focus on salient
regions and improve discriminative performance. Specifically, each baseline
model is augmented with either a Squeeze and Excitation block or a hybrid
Convolutional Block Attention Module, allowing adaptive recalibration of
channel and spatial feature representations. The proposed models are evaluated
on two distinct medical imaging datasets, a brain tumor MRI dataset comprising
multiple tumor subtypes, and a Products of Conception histopathological dataset
containing four tissue categories. Experimental results demonstrate that
attention augmented CNNs consistently outperform baseline architectures across
all metrics. In particular, EfficientNetB5 with hybrid attention achieves the
highest overall performance, delivering substantial gains on both datasets.
Beyond improved classification accuracy, attention mechanisms enhance feature
localization, leading to better generalization across heterogeneous imaging
modalities. This work contributes a systematic comparative framework for
embedding attention modules in diverse CNN architectures and rigorously
assesses their impact across multiple medical imaging tasks. The findings
provide practical insights for the development of robust, interpretable, and
clinically applicable deep learning based decision support systems.

Abstract: Timely and accurate detection of defects and contaminants in solar panels is
critical for maintaining the efficiency and reliability of photovoltaic
systems. This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of five
state-of-the-art object detection models: YOLOv3, Faster R-CNN, RetinaNet,
EfficientDet, and Swin Transformer, for identifying physical and electrical
defects as well as surface contaminants such as dust, dirt, and bird droppings
on solar panels. A custom dataset, annotated in the COCO format and
specifically designed for solar panel defect and contamination detection, was
developed alongside a user interface to train and evaluate the models. The
performance of each model is assessed and compared based on mean Average
Precision (mAP), precision, recall, and inference speed. The results
demonstrate the trade-offs between detection accuracy and computational
efficiency, highlighting the relative strengths and limitations of each model.
These findings provide valuable guidance for selecting appropriate detection

Method: 使用3D卷积网络学习36个波段加分割热红外波段的空间-波段模式，通过简单标准化和局部填充处理缺失数据

Result: 在17个独立MODIS场景中达到约0.92的准确率，均方误差为0.014，核心地区呈现强一致性，但边缘区域有些错误

Conclusion: 聚合波段-空间学习能够提供全球范围的及时风沘报警，使用更大输入窗口或注意力模型可以进一步提升边缘检测效果

Abstract: Dust storms harm health and reduce visibility; quick detection from
satellites is needed. We present a near real-time system that flags dust at the
pixel level using multi-band images from NASA's Terra and Aqua (MODIS). A 3D
convolutional network learns patterns across all 36 bands, plus split thermal
bands, to separate dust from clouds and surface features. Simple normalization
and local filling handle missing data. An improved version raises training
speed by 21x and supports fast processing of full scenes. On 17 independent
MODIS scenes, the model reaches about 0.92 accuracy with a mean squared error
of 0.014. Maps show strong agreement in plume cores, with most misses along
edges. These results show that joint band-and-space learning can provide timely
dust alerts at global scale; using wider input windows or attention-based
models may further sharpen edges.

Abstract: Instance segmentation is essential for numerous computer vision applications,
including robotics, human-computer interaction, and autonomous driving.
Currently, popular models bring impressive performance in instance segmentation
by training with a large number of human annotations, which are costly to
collect. For this reason, we present a new framework that efficiently and
effectively segments objects without the need for human annotations. Firstly, a
MultiCut algorithm is applied to self-supervised features for coarse mask
segmentation. Then, a mask filter is employed to obtain high-quality coarse
masks. To train the segmentation network, we compute a novel superpixel-guided
mask loss, comprising hard loss and soft loss, with high-quality coarse masks
and superpixels segmented from low-level image features. Lastly, a
self-training process with a new adaptive loss is proposed to improve the
quality of predicted masks. We conduct experiments on public datasets in
instance segmentation and object detection to demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed framework. The results show that the proposed framework
outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Cell biomechanics involve a great number of complex phenomena that are
fundamental to the evolution of life itself and other associated processes,
ranging from the very early stages of embryo-genesis to the maintenance of
damaged structures or the growth of tumors. Given the importance of such
phenomena, increasing research has been dedicated to their understanding, but
the many interactions between them and their influence on the decisions of
cells as a collective network or cluster remain unclear. We present a new
approach that combines Structure Preserving Neural Networks, which study cell
movements as a purely mechanical system, with other Machine Learning tools
(Artificial Neural Networks), which allow taking into consideration
environmental factors that can be directly deduced from an experiment with
Computer Vision techniques. This new model, tested on simulated and real cell
migration cases, predicts complete cell trajectories following a roll-out
policy with a high level of accuracy. This work also includes a mitosis event

Abstract: Many super-resolution (SR) algorithms have been proposed to increase image
resolution. However, full-reference (FR) image quality assessment (IQA) metrics
for comparing and evaluating different SR algorithms are limited. In this work,
we propose the Perception-oriented Bidirectional Attention Network (PBAN) for
image SR FR-IQA, which is composed of three modules: an image encoder module, a
perception-oriented bidirectional attention (PBA) module, and a quality
prediction module. First, we encode the input images for feature
representations. Inspired by the characteristics of the human visual system, we
then construct the perception-oriented PBA module. Specifically, different from
existing attention-based SR IQA methods, we conceive a Bidirectional Attention
to bidirectionally construct visual attention to distortion, which is
consistent with the generation and evaluation processes of SR images. To
further guide the quality assessment towards the perception of distorted
information, we propose Grouped Multi-scale Deformable Convolution, enabling
the proposed method to adaptively perceive distortion. Moreover, we design
Sub-information Excitation Convolution to direct visual perception to both
sub-pixel and sub-channel attention. Finally, the quality prediction module is
exploited to integrate quality-aware features and regress quality scores.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed PBAN outperforms
state-of-the-art quality assessment methods.

Abstract: Brain tumor segmentation is a critical pre-processing step in the medical

process which is moderate. The initial model maintained consistent performance
across the validation set without showing signs of over-fitting.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于小波的频率感知变分自编码器(FA-VAE)框架，通过显式解耦低频和高频分量的优化，解决了现有潜在分词器在纹理重建中的高频信息丢失问题。

Motivation: 现有潜在生成模型在图像合成中表现出色，但重建图像往往缺乏真实感，特别是在具有尖锐过渡的纹理区域。研究发现传统目标函数固有地优先重建低频信息，导致高频保真度损失，产生过度平滑的输出和视觉伪影。

Conclusion: 频率感知优化对于实现真实图像表示至关重要，该方法在内容创作、神经渲染和医学成像等应用中具有广泛意义。

Abstract: Latent generative models have shown remarkable progress in high-fidelity
image synthesis, typically using a two-stage training process that involves
compressing images into latent embeddings via learned tokenizers in the first
stage. The quality of generation strongly depends on how expressive and
well-optimized these latent embeddings are. While various methods have been
proposed to learn effective latent representations, the reconstructed images
often lack realism, particularly in textured regions with sharp transitions,
due to loss of fine details governed by high frequencies. We conduct a detailed
frequency decomposition of existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) latent tokenizers
and show that conventional objectives inherently prioritize low-frequency
reconstruction, often at the expense of high-frequency fidelity. Our analysis
reveals these latent tokenizers exhibit a bias toward low-frequency
information, when jointly optimized, leading to over-smoothed outputs and
visual artifacts that diminish perceptual quality. To address this, we propose
a wavelet-based, frequency-aware variational autoencoder (FA-VAE) framework
that explicitly decouples the optimization of low- and high-frequency
components. This decoupling enables improved reconstruction of fine textures
while preserving global structure. Our approach bridges the fidelity gap in
current latent tokenizers and emphasizes the importance of frequency-aware
optimization for realistic image representation, with broader implications for
applications in content creation, neural rendering, and medical imaging.

Motivation: 现有欧几里得近似方法扭曲流形结构并减缓收敛速度，需要更好的方法来捕捉复杂流形结构

Method: 使用CNN-Transformer编码器提取特征嵌入，投影到球面空间，在双不变SO(4)空间中使用Riemannian距离近似测地距离，推理时使用可微Levenberg-Marquardt优化

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上实验显示，在患者特定和患者无关场景中都获得了优越的准确性

Conclusion: 非欧几里得球面特征空间的相似性学习方法能够更好地捕捉复杂流形结构，提高2D/3D配准性能

Abstract: Intraoperative 2D/3D registration aligns preoperative 3D volumes with
real-time 2D radiographs, enabling accurate localization of instruments and
implants. A recent fully differentiable similarity learning framework
approximates geodesic distances on SE(3), expanding the capture range of
registration and mitigating the effects of substantial disturbances, but
existing Euclidean approximations distort manifold structure and slow
convergence. To address these limitations, we explore similarity learning in
non-Euclidean spherical feature spaces to better capture and fit complex
manifold structure. We extract feature embeddings using a CNN-Transformer
encoder, project them into spherical space, and approximate their geodesic
distances with Riemannian distances in the bi-invariant SO(4) space. This
enables a more expressive and geometrically consistent deep similarity metric,
enhancing the ability to distinguish subtle pose differences. During inference,
we replace gradient descent with fully differentiable Levenberg-Marquardt
optimization to accelerate convergence. Experiments on real and synthetic
datasets show superior accuracy in both patient-specific and patient-agnostic
scenarios.

Abstract: Deep Convolutional Neural Networks have achieved state of the art performance
across various computer vision tasks, however their practical deployment is
limited by computational and memory overhead. This paper introduces
Differential Sensitivity Fusion Pruning, a novel single shot filter pruning
framework that focuses on evaluating the stability and redundancy of filter
importance scores across multiple criteria. Differential Sensitivity Fusion
Pruning computes a differential sensitivity score for each filter by fusing the
discrepancies among gradient based sensitivity, first order Taylor expansion,
and KL divergence of activation distributions. An exponential scaling mechanism
is applied to emphasize filters with inconsistent importance across metrics,
identifying candidates that are structurally unstable or less critical to the
model performance. Unlike iterative or reinforcement learning based pruning
strategies, Differential Sensitivity Fusion Pruning is efficient and
deterministic, requiring only a single forward-backward pass for scoring and
pruning. Extensive experiments across varying pruning rates between 50 to 70
percent demonstrate that Differential Sensitivity Fusion Pruning significantly
reduces model complexity, achieving over 80 percent Floating point Operations
Per Seconds reduction while maintaining high accuracy. For instance, at 70
percent pruning, our approach retains up to 98.23 percent of baseline accuracy,
surpassing traditional heuristics in both compression and generalization. The
proposed method presents an effective solution for scalable and adaptive Deep
Convolutional Neural Networks compression, paving the way for efficient
deployment on edge and mobile platforms.

Conclusion: 该研究为选择冻结策略提供了实证发现和实践指南，提出了一种实用、基于证据的平衡转移学习方法，适用于资源有限场景下的目标检测

Abstract: The You Only Look Once (YOLO) architecture is crucial for real-time object
detection. However, deploying it in resource-constrained environments such as
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) requires efficient transfer learning. Although
layer freezing is a common technique, the specific impact of various freezing
configurations on contemporary YOLOv8 and YOLOv10 architectures remains
unexplored, particularly with regard to the interplay between freezing depth,
dataset characteristics, and training dynamics. This research addresses this
gap by presenting a detailed analysis of layer-freezing strategies. We
systematically investigate multiple freezing configurations across YOLOv8 and
YOLOv10 variants using four challenging datasets that represent critical
infrastructure monitoring. Our methodology integrates a gradient behavior
analysis (L2 norm) and visual explanations (Grad-CAM) to provide deeper
insights into training dynamics under different freezing strategies. Our
results reveal that there is no universal optimal freezing strategy but,
rather, one that depends on the properties of the data. For example, freezing
the backbone is effective for preserving general-purpose features, while a
shallower freeze is better suited to handling extreme class imbalance. These
configurations reduce graphics processing unit (GPU) memory consumption by up
to 28% compared to full fine-tuning and, in some cases, achieve mean average
precision (mAP@50) scores that surpass those of full fine-tuning. Gradient
analysis corroborates these findings, showing distinct convergence patterns for
moderately frozen models. Ultimately, this work provides empirical findings and
practical guidelines for selecting freezing strategies. It offers a practical,
evidence-based approach to balanced transfer learning for object detection in
scenarios with limited resources.

Conclusion: QUAN展示了在资源受限机器人系统中部署的潜力，特别适用于需要旋转感知的应用领域。

Abstract: This paper introduces Quaternion Approximate Networks (QUAN), a novel deep
learning framework that leverages quaternion algebra for rotation equivariant
image classification and object detection. Unlike conventional quaternion
neural networks attempting to operate entirely in the quaternion domain, QUAN
approximates quaternion convolution through Hamilton product decomposition
using real-valued operations. This approach preserves geometric properties
while enabling efficient implementation with custom CUDA kernels. We introduce
Independent Quaternion Batch Normalization (IQBN) for training stability and
extend quaternion operations to spatial attention mechanisms. QUAN is evaluated
on image classification (CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet), object detection (COCO,
DOTA), and robotic perception tasks. In classification tasks, QUAN achieves
higher accuracy with fewer parameters and faster convergence compared to
existing convolution and quaternion-based models. For objection detection, QUAN
demonstrates improved parameter efficiency and rotation handling over standard
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) while establishing the SOTA for quaternion
CNNs in this downstream task. These results highlight its potential for
deployment in resource-constrained robotic systems requiring rotation-aware
perception and application in other domains.

TL;DR: VALA方法通过可见性感知语言聚合和流式加权几何中值，解决了3D高斯中语言特征蒸馏的背景干扰和多视角不一致问题，显著提升了开放词汇定位和分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在将2D图像的开放词汇语言特征蒸馏到3D高斯时存在两个基本问题：背景高斯与前景高斯获得相同特征，以及多视角语言嵌入中的视角特定噪声导致的不一致性。

Method: 提出可见性感知语言聚合(VALA)，计算每条光线的边际贡献并应用可见性感知门控保留可见高斯；使用流式加权几何中值在余弦空间中合并噪声多视角特征。

Result: VALA在参考数据集上改善了开放词汇定位和分割性能，一致性地超越了现有工作。

Conclusion: 该方法以快速且内存高效的方式产生了鲁棒、视角一致的语言特征嵌入，有效解决了3D场景语言交互中的关键问题。

Abstract: Recently, distilling open-vocabulary language features from 2D images into 3D
Gaussians has attracted significant attention. Although existing methods
achieve impressive language-based interactions of 3D scenes, we observe two
fundamental issues: background Gaussians contributing negligibly to a rendered
pixel get the same feature as the dominant foreground ones, and multi-view
inconsistencies due to view-specific noise in language embeddings. We introduce
Visibility-Aware Language Aggregation (VALA), a lightweight yet effective
method that computes marginal contributions for each ray and applies a
visibility-aware gate to retain only visible Gaussians. Moreover, we propose a
streaming weighted geometric median in cosine space to merge noisy multi-view
features. Our method yields a robust, view-consistent language feature
embedding in a fast and memory-efficient manner. VALA improves open-vocabulary
localization and segmentation across reference datasets, consistently
surpassing existing works.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于对比学习的表示学习框架DuoCLR，通过预训练修剪后的骨架序列来增强人体动作分割性能。该方法采用新颖的数据增强策略和两个代理任务，在多尺度表示学习和跨序列变化利用方面表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的表示学习方法主要针对动作识别任务，基于孤立的序列级表示，缺乏对动作分割任务中多尺度表示和跨序列变化的有效利用。需要一种专门针对动作分割的预训练框架。

Method: 提出DuoCLR框架，包含：1）'Shuffle and Warp'数据增强策略生成多样化的多动作排列；2）两个对比学习代理任务：跨排列对比（CPC）学习类内相似性，相对顺序推理（ROR）推理类间上下文；3）在修剪骨架数据集上预训练。

Result: 在未修剪数据集上的评估显示，DuoCLR在多类和多标签动作分割任务中都显著优于最先进的对比方法，证明了其有效性。消融研究验证了各组件的重要性。

Conclusion: 该对比学习框架通过创新的数据增强和双代理任务设计，成功学习了适用于动作分割的多尺度特征表示，为基于骨架的动作分割任务提供了有效的预训练解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, a contrastive representation learning framework is proposed to
enhance human action segmentation via pre-training using trimmed (single
action) skeleton sequences. Unlike previous representation learning works that
are tailored for action recognition and that build upon isolated sequence-wise
representations, the proposed framework focuses on exploiting multi-scale
representations in conjunction with cross-sequence variations. More
specifically, it proposes a novel data augmentation strategy, 'Shuffle and
Warp', which exploits diverse multi-action permutations. The latter effectively
assists two surrogate tasks that are introduced in contrastive learning: Cross
Permutation Contrasting (CPC) and Relative Order Reasoning (ROR). In
optimization, CPC learns intra-class similarities by contrasting
representations of the same action class across different permutations, while
ROR reasons about inter-class contexts by predicting relative mapping between
two permutations. Together, these tasks enable a Dual-Surrogate Contrastive
Learning (DuoCLR) network to learn multi-scale feature representations
optimized for action segmentation. In experiments, DuoCLR is pre-trained on a
trimmed skeleton dataset and evaluated on an untrimmed dataset where it
demonstrates a significant boost over state-the-art comparatives in both
multi-class and multi-label action segmentation tasks. Lastly, ablation studies
are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of each component of the proposed
approach.

TL;DR: 事件相机指导去模糊的RED网络，通过随机投影策略和解耦全尺度注意力，解决事件流不完整性问题，提升去模糊的精度和稳健性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视了事件流的本质不完整性（由于DVS阈值机制引入的敏感性与噪声的批扣），这科学问题影响了运动先验知识的完整性，限制了事件指导去模糊的效果。

Method: 1. 稳健性导向的批打策略(RPS)：通过随机投影事件暴露网络于不完整模式，以应对各种未知场景条件。 2. 解耦全尺度注意力(OmniAttention)：显式建模内部运动、运动间和跨模态相关性。 3. 两个交互模块：增强模糊图像中的运动敏感区域，向不完整事件表征注入语义上下文。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的大量实验表明，RED网络在精度和稳健性方面均达到了最先进水平。

Conclusion: 通过重视事件流的不完整性问题并提出相应解决方案，RED网络有效提升了事件指导去模糊的性能和应用范围。

Abstract: Event cameras provide sparse yet temporally high-temporal-resolution motion
information, demonstrating great potential for motion deblurring. Existing
methods focus on cross-modal interaction, overlooking the inherent
incompleteness of event streams, which arises from the trade-off between
sensitivity and noise introduced by the thresholding mechanism of Dynamic
Vision Sensors (DVS). Such degradation compromises the integrity of motion
priors and limits the effectiveness of event-guided deblurring. To tackle these
challenges, we propose a Robust Event-guided Deblurring (RED) network with
modality-specific disentangled representation. First, we introduce a
Robustness-Oriented Perturbation Strategy (RPS) that applies random masking to
events, which exposes RED to incomplete patterns and then foster robustness
against various unknown scenario conditions.Next, a disentangled OmniAttention
is presented to explicitly model intra-motion, inter-motion, and cross-modality
correlations from two inherently distinct but complementary sources: blurry
images and partially disrupted events. Building on these reliable features, two
interactive modules are designed to enhance motion-sensitive areas in blurry
images and inject semantic context into incomplete event representations.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate RED
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and
robustness.

Method: 提出基于参数敏感性分析的量化方法：优先量化高敏感性参数，利用未量化低敏感性参数补偿量化错误；通过列向敏感性聚类实现行并行量化框架，采用全局共享逆Hessian矩阵更新机制降低计算复杂度。

Result: 在ResNet-50和YOLOv5s上实验，相比Optimal Brain Quantization基准方法量化速度提升20-200倍，平均精度损失低于0.3%，高效终结方法的效果。

Conclusion: 该方法通过参数敏感性分析和行并行量化框架，在保持精度的同时大幅提升量化效率，为边缘计算和实时推理场景提供了高效的模型压缩解决方案。

Abstract: Model quantization reduces neural network parameter precision to achieve
compression, but often compromises accuracy. Existing post-training
quantization (PTQ) methods employ iterative parameter updates to preserve
accuracy under high compression ratios, incurring significant computational
complexity and resource overhead, which limits applicability in
resource-constrained edge computing and real-time inference scenarios. This
paper proposes an efficient PTQ method guided by parameter sensitivity
analysis. The approach prioritizes quantization of high-sensitivity parameters,
leveraging unquantized low-sensitivity parameters to compensate for
quantization errors, thereby mitigating accuracy degradation. Furthermore, by
exploiting column-wise clustering of parameter sensitivity, the method
introduces a row-parallel quantization framework with a globally shared inverse
Hessian matrix update mechanism, reducing computational complexity by an order
of magnitude. Experimental results on ResNet-50 and YOLOv5s demonstrate a
20-200-fold quantization speedup over the Optimal Brain Quantization baseline,
with mean accuracy loss below 0.3%, confirming the method's efficacy in
balancing efficiency and accuracy.

Method: 使用WebSSL构建大规模一次性Gaussian头部生成器，采用两阶段训练策略，分离重建与驱动模块。

Result: 在512x512分辨率下达到90 FPS渲染速度，高频细节重建能力显著提升，性能超过当前最佳方法。

Conclusion: 该分离框架有效结合了高质量重建和高效驱动，遵循缩放定律，为单图虚拟人物生成提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore a reconstruction and reenactment separated
framework for 3D Gaussians head, which requires only a single portrait image as
input to generate controllable avatar. Specifically, we developed a large-scale
one-shot gaussian head generator built upon WebSSL and employed a two-stage
training approach that significantly enhances the capabilities of
generalization and high-frequency texture reconstruction. During inference, an
ultra-lightweight gaussian avatar driven by control signals enables high
frame-rate rendering, achieving 90 FPS at a resolution of 512x512. We further
demonstrate that the proposed framework follows the scaling law, whereby
increasing the parameter scale of the reconstruction module leads to improved
performance. Moreover, thanks to the separation design, driving efficiency
remains unaffected. Finally, extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments
validate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: MFFI数据集成功解决了现有Deepfake检测数据集的局限性，为真实世界场景下的面部伪造检测提供了更全面和实用的基准数据集。

Abstract: Rapid advances in Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) have
enabled increasingly sophisticated face forgeries, posing a significant threat
to social security. However, current Deepfake detection methods are limited by
constraints in existing datasets, which lack the diversity necessary in
real-world scenarios. Specifically, these data sets fall short in four key
areas: unknown of advanced forgery techniques, variability of facial scenes,
richness of real data, and degradation of real-world propagation. To address
these challenges, we propose the Multi-dimensional Face Forgery Image
(\textbf{MFFI}) dataset, tailored for real-world scenarios. MFFI enhances
realism based on four strategic dimensions: 1) Wider Forgery Methods; 2) Varied
Facial Scenes; 3) Diversified Authentic Data; 4) Multi-level Degradation
Operations. MFFI integrates $50$ different forgery methods and contains $1024K$
image samples. Benchmark evaluations show that MFFI outperforms existing public
datasets in terms of scene complexity, cross-domain generalization capability,
and detection difficulty gradients. These results validate the technical
advance and practical utility of MFFI in simulating real-world conditions. The
dataset and additional details are publicly available at

TL;DR: VideoGraph：一种基于语言引导的时空图建模方法，通过递归图网络处理视频摘要任务，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频摘要方法主要关注帧间的时间建模，但忽略了细粒度视觉实体（如对象）的语义关联。语言引导的视频摘要需要更全面的语言理解能力来处理复杂真实世界视频

Method: 提出递归时空图网络VideoGraph，将对象和帧分别建模为空间图和时间图的节点，通过图边表示语义关系。引入语言查询来增强节点语义表示，避免仅依赖视觉相似性，并采用递归策略优化图结构

Result: 在多个通用和查询聚焦的视频摘要基准测试中，VideoGraph在监督和无监督设置下均达到了最先进的性能

Conclusion: 将视频摘要建模为语言引导的时空图问题，通过语义关系建模和递归优化策略，能够有效提升视频摘要的质量和准确性

Abstract: Video summarization aims to select keyframes that are visually diverse and
can represent the whole story of a given video. Previous approaches have
focused on global interlinkability between frames in a video by temporal
modeling. However, fine-grained visual entities, such as objects, are also
highly related to the main content of the video. Moreover, language-guided
video summarization, which has recently been studied, requires a comprehensive
linguistic understanding of complex real-world videos. To consider how all the
objects are semantically related to each other, this paper regards video
summarization as a language-guided spatiotemporal graph modeling problem. We
present recursive spatiotemporal graph networks, called VideoGraph, which
formulate the objects and frames as nodes of the spatial and temporal graphs,
respectively. The nodes in each graph are connected and aggregated with graph
edges, representing the semantic relationships between the nodes. To prevent
the edges from being configured with visual similarity, we incorporate language
queries derived from the video into the graph node representations, enabling
them to contain semantic knowledge. In addition, we adopt a recursive strategy
to refine initial graphs and correctly classify each frame node as a keyframe.
In our experiments, VideoGraph achieves state-of-the-art performance on several
benchmarks for generic and query-focused video summarization in both supervised
and unsupervised manners. The code is available at

Result: 在多个密集视觉标准测试集上达到了最先进的结果

Conclusion: 通过补丁级别的对齐方法能够有效地将现有语义知识转移到密集特征空间，为密集视觉任务提供更好的表征

Abstract: Dense representations are essential for vision tasks that require spatial
precision and fine-grained detail. While most self-supervised representation
learning methods focus on global representations that summarize the image as a
whole, such approaches often fall short in capturing the localized semantics
necessary for dense prediction tasks. To overcome these limitations, we propose
a framework that builds on pretrained representations through additional
self-supervised learning, aiming to transfer existing semantic knowledge into
the dense feature space. Our method aligns the distributions of dense features
between a teacher and a student model. Specifically, we introduce Patch-level
Kernel Alignment (PaKA), a simple yet effective alignment objective that
captures statistical dependencies, thereby matching the structural
relationships of dense patches across the two models. In addition, we
investigate augmentation strategies specifically designed for dense
representation learning. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art results across
a variety of dense vision benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our
approach.

Motivation: 现有VLA模型剪枝方法仅使用当前动作的局部信息，忽略了历史动作的全局上下文，导致成功率下降超过20%且加速效果有限

Method: 提出静态动作级剪枝（利用全局历史和局部上下文减少视觉token）、动态层级剪枝（基于层级重要性剪枝token）和轻量级动作感知控制器（根据动作粒度调整剪枝强度）

Result: 在LIBERO数据集上，相比OpenVLA-OFT，在NVIDIA A800上实现1.46倍加速，在NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090上实现1.57倍加速，成功率损失可忽略不计

Conclusion: 结合局部和全局信息的两级剪枝方法能够有效提升VLA模型的推理速度，同时保持模型性能，为计算密集型模型的加速提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Pruning accelerates compute-bound models by reducing computation. Recently
applied to Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, existing methods prune tokens
using only local info from current action, ignoring global context from prior
actions, causing >20% success rate drop and limited speedup. We observe high
similarity across consecutive actions and propose leveraging both local
(current) and global (past) info for smarter token selection. We introduce
SpecPrune-VLA, a training-free method with two-level pruning and heuristic
control: (1) Static pruning at action level: uses global history and local
context to reduce visual tokens per action; (2) Dynamic pruning at layer level:
prunes tokens per layer based on layer-specific importance; (3) Lightweight
action-aware controller: classifies actions as coarse/fine-grained (by speed),
adjusting pruning aggressiveness since fine-grained actions are
pruning-sensitive. Experiments on LIBERO show SpecPrune-VLA achieves 1.46 times
speedup on NVIDIA A800 and 1.57 times on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 vs.
OpenVLA-OFT, with negligible success rate loss.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的概念擦除方法在处理窄概念（如版权角色、名人）时存在困难，这些概念与非目标概念距离很近，需要更精细的操作。擦除这些窄概念对于解决版权和法律问题至关重要。

Method: SuMa首先推导出表示要擦除概念的目标子空间，然后通过将其映射到最小化两个子空间之间距离的参考子空间来中和该概念。这种映射确保目标概念被鲁棒擦除的同时保持图像质量。

Result: 在四个任务（子类擦除、名人擦除、艺术风格擦除和实例擦除）上的广泛实验表明，SuMa在图像质量上与专注于有效性的方法相当，同时在完整性方面与专注于完整性的方法结果相当。

Conclusion: SuMa是一种新颖的方法，专门设计用于在擦除窄概念时同时实现鲁棒性和有效性，为解决文本到图像扩散模型的版权和法律问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid growth of text-to-image diffusion models has raised concerns about
their potential misuse in generating harmful or unauthorized contents. To
address these issues, several Concept Erasure methods have been proposed.
However, most of them fail to achieve both robustness, i.e., the ability to
robustly remove the target concept., and effectiveness, i.e., maintaining image
quality. While few recent techniques successfully achieve these goals for NSFW
concepts, none could handle narrow concepts such as copyrighted characters or
celebrities. Erasing these narrow concepts is critical in addressing copyright
and legal concerns. However, erasing them is challenging due to their close
distances to non-target neighboring concepts, requiring finer-grained
manipulation. In this paper, we introduce Subspace Mapping (SuMa), a novel
method specifically designed to achieve both robustness and effectiveness in
easing these narrow concepts. SuMa first derives a target subspace representing
the concept to be erased and then neutralizes it by mapping it to a reference
subspace that minimizes the distance between the two. This mapping ensures the
target concept is robustly erased while preserving image quality. We conduct
extensive experiments with SuMa across four tasks: subclass erasure, celebrity
erasure, artistic style erasure, and instance erasure and compare the results
with current state-of-the-art methods. Our method achieves image quality
comparable to approaches focused on effectiveness, while also yielding results
that are on par with methods targeting completeness.

Abstract: Vehicle detection systems trained on Non-Bangladeshi datasets struggle to
accurately identify local vehicle types in Bangladesh's unique road
environments, creating critical gaps in autonomous driving technology for
developing regions. This study evaluates six YOLO model variants on a custom
dataset featuring 29 distinct vehicle classes, including region-specific
vehicles such as ``Desi Nosimon'', ``Leguna'', ``Battery Rickshaw'', and
``CNG''. The dataset comprises high-resolution images (1920x1080) captured
across various Bangladeshi roads using mobile phone cameras and manually
annotated using LabelImg with YOLO format bounding boxes. Performance
evaluation revealed YOLOv11x as the top performer, achieving 63.7\% mAP@0.5,
43.8\% mAP@0.5:0.95, 61.4\% recall, and 61.6\% F1-score, though requiring 45.8
milliseconds per image for inference. Medium variants (YOLOv8m, YOLOv11m)
struck an optimal balance, delivering robust detection performance with mAP@0.5
values of 62.5\% and 61.8\% respectively, while maintaining moderate inference
times around 14-15 milliseconds. The study identified significant detection
challenges for rare vehicle classes, with Construction Vehicles and Desi
Nosimons showing near-zero accuracy due to dataset imbalances and insufficient
training samples. Confusion matrices revealed frequent misclassifications
between visually similar vehicles, particularly Mini Trucks versus Mini Covered
Vans. This research provides a foundation for developing robust object
detection systems specifically adapted to Bangladesh traffic conditions,
addressing critical needs in autonomous vehicle technology advancement for
developing regions where conventional generic-trained models fail to perform
adequately.

Conclusion: EditIDv2成功解决了长文本叙事场景下的角色编辑挑战，通过创新的技术方法在最小数据需求下实现了高质量的语义编辑和身份保持。

Abstract: We propose EditIDv2, a tuning-free solution specifically designed for
high-complexity narrative scenes and long text inputs. Existing character
editing methods perform well under simple prompts, but often suffer from
degraded editing capabilities, semantic understanding biases, and identity
consistency breakdowns when faced with long text narratives containing multiple
semantic layers, temporal logic, and complex contextual relationships. In
EditID, we analyzed the impact of the ID integration module on editability. In
EditIDv2, we further explore and address the influence of the ID feature
integration module. The core of EditIDv2 is to discuss the issue of editability
injection under minimal data lubrication. Through a sophisticated decomposition
of PerceiverAttention, the introduction of ID loss and joint dynamic training
with the diffusion model, as well as an offline fusion strategy for the
integration module, we achieve deep, multi-level semantic editing while
maintaining identity consistency in complex narrative environments using only a
small amount of data lubrication. This meets the demands of long prompts and
high-quality image generation, and achieves excellent results in the IBench
evaluation.

Method: 提出语言场景图预测(LSGA)方法，采用面向对象的两阶段方法(OOTSM)：首先用LLM预测对象出现和消失，然后生成详细的人-物关系。将场景图预测任务解耦为场景图提取和纯文本预测两个步骤

Result: 在Action Genome基准测试中，短期mean-Recall(@10)提升3.4%，长期mean-Recall(@50)大幅提升21.9%，达到state-of-the-art性能

Conclusion: 纯文本的语言模型方法在场景图预测任务中表现优异，特别是在长期预测方面。OOTSM方法有效整合了常识知识，为场景理解提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: A scene graph is a structured represention of objects and their relationships
in a scene. Scene Graph Anticipation (SGA) involves predicting future scene
graphs from video clips, enabling applications as intelligent surveillance and
human-machine collaboration. Existing SGA approaches primarily leverage visual
cues, often struggling to integrate valuable commonsense knowledge, thereby
limiting long-term prediction robustness. To explicitly leverage such
commonsense knowledge, we propose a new approach to better understand the
objects, concepts, and relationships in a scene graph. Our approach decouples
the SGA task in two steps: first a scene graph capturing model is used to
convert a video clip into a sequence of scene graphs, then a pure text-based
model is used to predict scene graphs in future frames. Our focus in this work
is on the second step, and we call it Linguistic Scene Graph Anticipation
(LSGA) and believes it should have independent interest beyond the use in SGA
discussed here. For LSGA, we introduce an Object-Oriented Two-Staged Method
(OOTSM) where an Large Language Model (LLM) first forecasts object appearances
and disappearances before generating detailed human-object relations. We
conduct extensive experiments to evaluate OOTSM in two settings. For LSGA, we
evaluate our fine-tuned open-sourced LLMs against zero-shot APIs (i.e., GPT-4o,
GPT-4o-mini, and DeepSeek-V3) on a benchmark constructed from Action Genome
annotations. For SGA, we combine our OOTSM with STTran++ from, and our
experiments demonstrate effective state-of-the-art performance: short-term
mean-Recall (@10) increases by 3.4% while long-term mean-Recall (@50) improves
dramatically by 21.9%. Code is available at https://github.com/ZhuXMMM/OOTSM.

*Wasikul Islam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文将高能物理中堆积干扰的减少策略转化为图像去噪的物理导向偏置，通过测试高噪声情况下的稳健性来验证物理受启的模型优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受高能粒子物理中堆积干扰减少策略的启发，探索如何将物理学原理（如守恒性、局域性、隔离性）作为偏置嵌入神经网络架构，提高图像去噪模型在强干扰条件下的稳健性。

Method: 提出了一个受PU启发的去噪器层次结构：包括带守恒约束的清澄CNN、其高斯噪声变体以及WIPUNet（结合了物理偏置和UNet背榜）。在CIFAR-10和BSD500数据集上进行实验，测试不同噪声水平下的表现。

Result: 在高噪声水平（σ=50-100）下，WIPUNet显示出越来越明显的优势，而标准基线模型性能下降。这表明物理受启的偏置能够在纯数据驱动模型性能退化时提供稳健性。

Conclusion: 这是一个概念验证研究，证明了物理受启的偏置可以在不依赖复杂SOTA机制的情况下提高高噪声条件下的稳健性，为物理导向的深度学习模型提供了新的思路。

Abstract: In high-energy particle physics, collider measurements are contaminated by
"pileup", overlapping soft interactions that obscure the hard-scatter signal of
interest. Dedicated subtraction strategies exploit physical priors such as
conservation, locality, and isolation. Inspired by this analogy, we investigate
how such principles can inform image denoising by embedding physics-guided
inductive biases into neural architectures. This paper is a proof of concept:
rather than targeting state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmarks, we ask whether
physics-inspired priors improve robustness under strong corruption.
  We introduce a hierarchy of PU-inspired denoisers: a residual CNN with
conservation constraints, its Gaussian-noise variants, and the Weighted
Inductive Pileup-physics-inspired U-Network for Denoising (WIPUNet), which
integrates these ideas into a UNet backbone. On CIFAR-10 with Gaussian noise at
$\sigma\in\{15,25,50,75,100\}$, PU-inspired CNNs are competitive with standard
baselines, while WIPUNet shows a \emph{widening margin} at higher noise.
Complementary BSD500 experiments show the same trend, suggesting
physics-inspired priors provide stability where purely data-driven models
degrade. Our contributions are: (i) translating pileup-mitigation principles
into modular inductive biases; (ii) integrating them into UNet; and (iii)
demonstrating robustness gains at high noise without relying on heavy SOTA
machinery.

TL;DR: CAMVR框架通过视觉-文本上下文记忆单元和自适应视觉聚焦机制，解决了多轮视觉对话中的上下文丢失和幻觉问题，在多个数据集上达到SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型和视觉语言大模型在单轮任务表现优秀，但在需要深度上下文理解和复杂视觉推理的多轮交互中存在推理碎片化、上下文丢失和幻觉等挑战

Method: 提出CAMVR框架，包含两个关键创新：1) Visual-Textual Context Memory Unit (VCMU) - 动态读写记忆网络，存储管理视觉特征和文本语义表示；2) Adaptive Visual Focus Guidance (AVFG) - 利用VCMU上下文动态调整视觉编码器注意力到相关图像区域

Result: 在VisDial、A-OKVQA和MTIF等多个挑战性数据集上的广泛实验表明，CAMVR始终实现最先进的性能

Conclusion: CAMVR框架通过多级推理集成策略，确保响应生成与当前输入和累积历史上下文深度一致，显著提升了多轮视觉-文本推理能力

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs)
excel in single-turn tasks but face significant challenges in multi-turn
interactions requiring deep contextual understanding and complex visual
reasoning, often leading to fragmented reasoning, context loss, and
hallucinations. To address these limitations, we propose Context-Aware
Multi-Turn Visual Reasoning (CAMVR), a novel framework designed to empower
LVLMs with robust and coherent multi-turn visual-textual inference
capabilities. CAMVR introduces two key innovations: a Visual-Textual Context
Memory Unit (VCMU), a dynamic read-write memory network that stores and manages
critical visual features, textual semantic representations, and their
cross-modal correspondences from each interaction turn; and an Adaptive Visual
Focus Guidance (AVFG) mechanism, which leverages the VCMU's context to
dynamically adjust the visual encoder's attention to contextually relevant
image regions. Our multi-level reasoning integration strategy ensures that
response generation is deeply coherent with both current inputs and accumulated
historical context. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets, including
VisDial, an adapted A-OKVQA, and our novel Multi-Turn Instruction Following
(MTIF) dataset, demonstrate that CAMVR consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了MeshMetrics框架，通过网格基硅计算方法提高了距离基准确性评估指标的精确度，解决了当前图像分割预测评估中存在的重现性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像分割预测评估存在严重的重现性危机，尤其是距离基准确性评估指标的实现不可靠导致不同工具间存在显著差异，影响研究结果的可比性和可靠性。

Method: 设计了MeshMetrics框架，采用网格基硅计算方法，比传统的格点基硅方法更精确地计算距离基准确性评估指标，减少离散化效应带来的误差。

Result: 经过理论分析和实验验证，MeshMetrics在准确性和精度方面都超过了现有工具，对距离量化效应的影响显著降低，比如Hausdorff距离差异超过100mm，标准化表面距离差异达30%。

Conclusion: MeshMetrics作为一个开源Python包提供了更可靠的距离基准确性评估指标计算方法，有助于提高图像分割预测评估的重现性和可比性。

Abstract: The surge of research in image segmentation has yielded remarkable
performance gains but also exposed a reproducibility crisis. A major
contributor is performance evaluation, where both selection and implementation
of metrics play critical roles. While recent efforts have improved the former,
the reliability of metric implementation has received far less attention.
Pitfalls in distance-based metric implementation can lead to considerable
discrepancies between common open-source tools, for instance, exceeding 100 mm
for the Hausdorff distance and 30%pt for the normalized surface distance for
the same pair of segmentations. To address these pitfalls, we introduce
MeshMetrics, a mesh-based framework that provides a more precise computation of
distance-based metrics than conventional grid-based approaches. Through
theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate that MeshMetrics
achieves higher accuracy and precision than established tools, and is
substantially less affected by discretization artifacts, such as distance
quantization. We release MeshMetrics as an open-source Python package,
available at https://github.com/gasperpodobnik/MeshMetrics.

TL;DR: LVLM-VAR是一个基于预训练视觉-语言大模型的新框架，通过视频到语义标记转换和LoRA微调，在视频动作识别任务中实现了最先进的性能并显著提升了模型可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在处理多样化视频数据时难以实现深度语义理解、复杂上下文信息和细粒度区分，因此需要利用大语言模型的强大能力来解决这些限制。

Method: 提出Video-to-Semantic-Tokens模块将原始视频序列转换为离散的语义动作标记，结合自然语言指令，通过LoRA微调的LVLM（如LLaVA-13B）进行动作分类和语义推理。

Result: 在NTU RGB+D和NTU RGB+D 120等挑战性基准测试中达到最先进或极具竞争力的性能（NTU RGB+D X-Sub达94.1%，NTU RGB+D 120 X-Set达90.0%），并显著提升模型可解释性。

Conclusion: LVLM-VAR成功将预训练视觉-语言大模型应用于视频动作识别，不仅实现了优异的分类性能，还通过生成自然语言解释大大增强了模型的可解释性。

Abstract: Human action recognition often struggles with deep semantic understanding,
complex contextual information, and fine-grained distinction, limitations that
traditional methods frequently encounter when dealing with diverse video data.
Inspired by the remarkable capabilities of large language models, this paper
introduces LVLM-VAR, a novel framework that pioneers the application of
pre-trained Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) to video action recognition,
emphasizing enhanced accuracy and interpretability. Our method features a
Video-to-Semantic-Tokens (VST) Module, which innovatively transforms raw video
sequences into discrete, semantically and temporally consistent "semantic
action tokens," effectively crafting an "action narrative" that is
comprehensible to an LVLM. These tokens, combined with natural language
instructions, are then processed by a LoRA-fine-tuned LVLM (e.g., LLaVA-13B)
for robust action classification and semantic reasoning. LVLM-VAR not only
achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance on challenging
benchmarks such as NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120, demonstrating significant
improvements (e.g., 94.1% on NTU RGB+D X-Sub and 90.0% on NTU RGB+D 120 X-Set),
but also substantially boosts model interpretability by generating natural
language explanations for its predictions.

Conclusion: 通过整合RGB和法线图像的几何结构信息，有效解决了跨视角地理定位中的视角差异问题，为无人机定位和导航提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization plays a critical role in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
(UAV) localization and navigation. However, significant challenges arise from
the drastic viewpoint differences and appearance variations between images.
Existing methods predominantly rely on semantic features from RGB images, often
neglecting the importance of spatial structural information in capturing
viewpoint-invariant features. To address this issue, we incorporate geometric
structural information from normal images and introduce a Joint perception
network to integrate RGB and Normal images (JRN-Geo). Our approach utilizes a
dual-branch feature extraction framework, leveraging a Difference-Aware Fusion
Module (DAFM) and Joint-Constrained Interaction Aggregation (JCIA) strategy to
enable deep fusion and joint-constrained semantic and structural information
representation. Furthermore, we propose a 3D geographic augmentation technique
to generate potential viewpoint variation samples, enhancing the network's
ability to learn viewpoint-invariant features. Extensive experiments on the
University-1652 and SUES-200 datasets validate the robustness of our method
against complex viewpoint ariations, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态传感器融合中的时间不一致性问题，提升下游SLAM任务的鲁棒性和性能。

Method: 引入三种时间一致性机制：时间嵌入相似性对齐连续潜在表示、运动对齐变换损失匹配位移、窗口时间融合模块；同时更新模型架构以保持空间结构。

Result: 在雷达/声纳到LiDAR转换任务中表现出更好的时间和空间一致性，降低了绝对轨迹误差，提高了Cartographer SLAM中的占据地图精度。

Conclusion: LiDAR-BIND-T保持了即插即用的多模态融合能力，同时显著增强了时间稳定性，为下游SLAM应用提供了更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper extends LiDAR-BIND, a modular multi-modal fusion framework that
binds heterogeneous sensors (radar, sonar) to a LiDAR-defined latent space,
with mechanisms that explicitly enforce temporal consistency. We introduce
three contributions: (i) temporal embedding similarity that aligns consecutive
latents, (ii) a motion-aligned transformation loss that matches displacement
between predictions and ground truth LiDAR, and (iii) windows temporal fusion
using a specialised temporal module. We further update the model architecture
to better preserve spatial structure. Evaluations on radar/sonar-to-LiDAR
translation demonstrate improved temporal and spatial coherence, yielding lower
absolute trajectory error and better occupancy map accuracy in
Cartographer-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping). We propose
different metrics based on the Fr\'echet Video Motion Distance (FVMD) and a
correlation-peak distance metric providing practical temporal quality
indicators to evaluate SLAM performance. The proposed temporal LiDAR-BIND, or
LiDAR-BIND-T, maintains plug-and-play modality fusion while substantially
enhancing temporal stability, resulting in improved robustness and performance
for downstream SLAM.

Abstract: We propose a multi-camera LiDAR-visual-inertial odometry framework,
Multi-LVI-SAM, which fuses data from multiple fisheye cameras, LiDAR and
inertial sensors for highly accurate and robust state estimation. To enable
efficient and consistent integration of visual information from multiple
fisheye cameras, we introduce a panoramic visual feature model that unifies
multi-camera observations into a single representation. The panoramic model
serves as a global geometric optimization framework that consolidates
multi-view constraints, enabling seamless loop closure and global pose
optimization, while simplifying system design by avoiding redundant handling of
individual cameras. To address the triangulation inconsistency caused by the
misalignment between each camera's frame and the panoramic model's frame, we
propose an extrinsic compensation method. This method improves feature
consistency across views and significantly reduces triangulation and
optimization errors, leading to more accurate pose estimation. We integrate the
panoramic visual feature model into a tightly coupled LiDAR-visual-inertial
system based on a factor graph. Extensive experiments on public datasets
demonstrate that the panoramic visual feature model enhances the quality and
consistency of multi-camera constraints, resulting in higher accuracy and
robustness than existing multi-camera LiDAR-visual-inertial systems.

<details>

Motivation: 传统单图超分辨假设空间不变的降级模型，但真实影像系统存在大气散射、景深变化、透视扭曲等复杂的距离依赖效应，需要空间适配的重建策略来获得最佳性能。

Method: 提出一种严格的变分框架，将超分辨形式化为空间变化逆问题，通过深度条件卷积内核实现神经网络结构，包含学习的距离适配正则化项和滤波生成网络。

Result: 在5个标准数据集上达到独创的性能，在KITTI室外场景中2倍和4倍超分辨上分别获得36.89/0.9516和30.54/0.8721的PSNR/SSIM值，比现有方法分别提升0.44dB和0.36dB。

Conclusion: 这项工作建立了第一个理论基础坚实的距离适配超分辨框架，在深度变化场景中实现了显著改进，同时在传统标准数据集上保持了竞争力。

Abstract: Single image super-resolution traditionally assumes spatially-invariant
degradation models, yet real-world imaging systems exhibit complex
distance-dependent effects including atmospheric scattering, depth-of-field
variations, and perspective distortions. This fundamental limitation
necessitates spatially-adaptive reconstruction strategies that explicitly
incorporate geometric scene understanding for optimal performance. We propose a
rigorous variational framework that characterizes super-resolution as a
spatially-varying inverse problem, formulating the degradation operator as a
pseudodifferential operator with distance-dependent spectral characteristics
that enable theoretical analysis of reconstruction limits across depth ranges.
Our neural architecture implements discrete gradient flow dynamics through
cascaded residual blocks with depth-conditional convolution kernels, ensuring
convergence to stationary points of the theoretical energy functional while
incorporating learned distance-adaptive regularization terms that dynamically
adjust smoothness constraints based on local geometric structure. Spectral
constraints derived from atmospheric scattering theory prevent bandwidth
violations and noise amplification in far-field regions, while adaptive kernel
generation networks learn continuous mappings from depth to reconstruction
filters. Comprehensive evaluation across five benchmark datasets demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance, achieving 36.89/0.9516 and 30.54/0.8721 PSNR/SSIM
at 2 and 4 scales on KITTI outdoor scenes, outperforming existing methods by
0.44dB and 0.36dB respectively. This work establishes the first
theoretically-grounded distance-adaptive super-resolution framework and
demonstrates significant improvements on depth-variant scenarios while
maintaining competitive performance across traditional benchmarks.

Abstract: We address the problem of accurate capture of interactive behaviors between
two people in daily scenarios. Most previous works either only consider one
person or solely focus on conversational gestures of two people, assuming the
body orientation and/or position of each actor are constant or barely change
over each interaction. In contrast, we propose to simultaneously model two
people's activities, and target objective-driven, dynamic, and semantically
consistent interactions which often span longer duration and cover bigger
space. To this end, we capture a new multi-modal dataset dubbed InterAct, which
is composed of 241 motion sequences where two people perform a realistic and
coherent scenario for one minute or longer over a complete interaction. For
each sequence, two actors are assigned different roles and emotion labels, and
collaborate to finish one task or conduct a common interaction activity. The
audios, body motions, and facial expressions of both persons are captured.
InterAct contains diverse and complex motions of individuals and interesting
and relatively long-term interaction patterns barely seen before. We also
demonstrate a simple yet effective diffusion-based method that estimates
interactive face expressions and body motions of two people from speech inputs.
Our method regresses the body motions in a hierarchical manner, and we also
propose a novel fine-tuning mechanism to improve the lip accuracy of facial
expressions. To facilitate further research, the data and code is made

Conclusion: PARSE-VOS通过分层推理框架有效解决了视频对象分割中的语义对齐问题，证明了免训练方法的有效性。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment an object of
interest throughout a video based on a language description. The prominent
challenge lies in aligning static text with dynamic visual content,
particularly when objects exhibiting similar appearances with inconsistent
motion and poses. However, current methods often rely on a holistic
visual-language fusion that struggles with complex, compositional descriptions.
In this paper, we propose \textbf{PARSE-VOS}, a novel, training-free framework
powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), for a hierarchical, coarse-to-fine
reasoning across text and video domains. Our approach begins by parsing the
natural language query into structured semantic commands. Next, we introduce a
spatio-temporal grounding module that generates all candidate trajectories for
all potential target objects, guided by the parsed semantics. Finally, a
hierarchical identification module select the correct target through a
two-stage reasoning process: it first performs coarse-grained motion reasoning
with an LLM to narrow down candidates; if ambiguity remains, a fine-grained
pose verification stage is conditionally triggered to disambiguate. The final
output is an accurate segmentation mask for the target object.
\textbf{PARSE-VOS} achieved state-of-the-art performance on three major
benchmarks: Ref-YouTube-VOS, Ref-DAVIS17, and MeViS.

Abstract: Deciphering oracle bone characters (OBCs), the oldest attested form of
written Chinese, has remained the ultimate, unwavering goal of scholars,
offering an irreplaceable key to understanding humanity's early modes of
production. Current decipherment methodologies of OBC are primarily constrained
by the sporadic nature of archaeological excavations and the limited corpus of
inscriptions. With the powerful visual perception capability of large
multimodal models (LMMs), the potential of using LMMs for visually deciphering
OBCs has increased. In this paper, we introduce PictOBI-20k, a dataset designed
to evaluate LMMs on the visual decipherment tasks of pictographic OBCs. It
includes 20k meticulously collected OBC and real object images, forming over
15k multi-choice questions. We also conduct subjective annotations to
investigate the consistency of the reference point between humans and LMMs in
visual reasoning. Experiments indicate that general LMMs possess preliminary
visual decipherment skills, and LMMs are not effectively using visual
information, while most of the time they are limited by language priors. We
hope that our dataset can facilitate the evaluation and optimization of visual
attention in future OBC-oriented LMMs. The code and dataset will be available
at https://github.com/OBI-Future/PictOBI-20k.

Abstract: In medical imaging, point distribution models are often used to reconstruct
and complete partial shapes using a statistical model of the full shape. A
commonly overlooked, but crucial factor in this reconstruction process, is the
pose of the training data relative to the partial target shape. A difference in
pose alignment of the training and target shape leads to biased solutions,
particularly when observing small parts of a shape. In this paper, we
demonstrate the importance of pose alignment for partial shape reconstructions
and propose an efficient method to adjust an existing model to a specific
target. Our method preserves the computational efficiency of linear models
while significantly improving reconstruction accuracy and predicted variance.
It exactly recovers the intended aligned model for translations, and provides a
good approximation for small rotations, all without access to the original
training data. Hence, existing shape models in reconstruction pipelines can be
adapted by a simple preprocessing step, making our approach widely applicable
in plug-and-play scenarios.

TL;DR: PointPillars是最快的3D物体检测器，但性能不如最先进方法。这篇论文提出了第一个基于伪图像表示的两阶段3D检测框架，通过3DPillars CNN结构和稀疏场景特征模块来充分利用场景上下文信息，在保持高效率的同时提升了检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决PointPillars的两大限制：1）伪图像表示无法保持精确的3D结构；2）难以采用两阶段检测流程。目标是缩小PointPillars与最先进方法的性能差距，同时保持其高效性。

Method: 提出了两个核心组件：1）3DPillars CNN结构：通过可分离氣格特征模块，使用2D卷积高效学习从伪图像表示中提取氣格基特征；2）稀疏场景上下文特征模块：在RoI头部聚合多尺度特征，获得稀疏场景特征，支持两阶段检测流程。

Conclusion: 这篇论文成功开发了第一个基于伪图像表示的两阶段3D检测框架，充分利用了场景上下文信息来精炼3D物体建议，在保持PointPillars高效性的同时大幅提升了检测性能，为高效精准3D检测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: PointPillars is the fastest 3D object detector that exploits pseudo image
representations to encode features for 3D objects in a scene. Albeit efficient,
PointPillars is typically outperformed by state-of-the-art 3D detection methods
due to the following limitations: 1) The pseudo image representations fail to
preserve precise 3D structures, and 2) they make it difficult to adopt a
two-stage detection pipeline using 3D object proposals that typically shows
better performance than a single-stage approach. We introduce in this paper the
first two-stage 3D detection framework exploiting pseudo image representations,
narrowing the performance gaps between PointPillars and state-of-the-art
methods, while retaining its efficiency. Our framework consists of two novel
components that overcome the aforementioned limitations of PointPillars: First,
we introduce a new CNN architecture, dubbed 3DPillars, that enables learning 3D
voxel-based features from the pseudo image representation efficiently using 2D
convolutions. The basic idea behind 3DPillars is that 3D features from voxels
can be viewed as a stack of pseudo images. To implement this idea, we propose a
separable voxel feature module that extracts voxel-based features without using
3D convolutions. Second, we introduce an RoI head with a sparse scene context
feature module that aggregates multi-scale features from 3DPillars to obtain a
sparse scene feature. This enables adopting a two-stage pipeline effectively,
and fully leveraging contextual information of a scene to refine 3D object
proposals. Experimental results on the KITTI and Waymo Open datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, achieving a good
compromise in terms of speed and accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出CRAB模型，通过相机-雷达融合和反向投影技术解决深度模糊问题，在nuScenes数据集上达到62.4% NDS和54.0% mAP的SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有相机-雷达融合方法存在BEV特征稀疏（前向投影）和深度模糊导致误检（反向投影）的问题，需要一种能充分利用两种传感器优势的解决方案

Method: 使用反向投影方法，结合图像密集但不准确的深度分布与雷达稀疏但精确的深度信息，通过空间交叉注意力机制融合雷达上下文信息

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上取得62.4% NDS和54.0% mAP的3D检测性能，在基于反向投影的相机-雷达融合方法中达到state-of-the-art

Conclusion: CRAB模型通过有效融合相机和雷达信息，成功解决了深度模糊问题，为BEV视角下的3D目标检测提供了高性能的解决方案

Abstract: Recently, camera-radar fusion-based 3D object detection methods in bird's eye
view (BEV) have gained attention due to the complementary characteristics and
cost-effectiveness of these sensors. Previous approaches using forward
projection struggle with sparse BEV feature generation, while those employing
backward projection overlook depth ambiguity, leading to false positives. In
this paper, to address the aforementioned limitations, we propose a novel
camera-radar fusion-based 3D object detection and segmentation model named CRAB
(Camera-Radar fusion for reducing depth Ambiguity in Backward projection-based
view transformation), using a backward projection that leverages radar to
mitigate depth ambiguity. During the view transformation, CRAB aggregates
perspective view image context features into BEV queries. It improves depth
distinction among queries along the same ray by combining the dense but
unreliable depth distribution from images with the sparse yet precise depth
information from radar occupancy. We further introduce spatial cross-attention
with a feature map containing radar context information to enhance the
comprehension of the 3D scene. When evaluated on the nuScenes open dataset, our
proposed approach achieves a state-of-the-art performance among backward
projection-based camera-radar fusion methods with 62.4\% NDS and 54.0\% mAP in
3D object detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗设备制造中的视觉检测面临小样本、不平衡数据集、高分辨率图像和严格监管要求的挑战，需要开发能够在受限环境下有效工作的异常检测方法。

Method: 第一种方法使用基于结构相似性的异常评分(4-MS-SSIM)，提供轻量级实时缺陷检测；第二种方法使用马氏距离评分对降维潜在特征进行处理，提供对分布偏移的高敏感性监控。

Result: 第一种方法在仅有10%缺陷样本的情况下达到ACC 0.903(无监督阈值)和0.931(有监督阈值)；第二种方法达到ACC 0.722(有监督阈值)。两种方法均优于重新实现的基线方法。

Conclusion: 这两种方法提供了互补能力：第一种支持可靠的在线检测，第二种支持可扩展的生产后监控和监管合规监测，为在受监管制造环境中部署深度异常检测提供了实用途径。

Abstract: Automating visual inspection in medical device manufacturing remains
challenging due to small and imbalanced datasets, high-resolution imagery, and
stringent regulatory requirements. This work proposes two attention-guided
autoencoder architectures for deep anomaly detection designed to address these
constraints. The first employs a structural similarity-based anomaly score
(4-MS-SSIM), offering lightweight and accurate real-time defect detection,
yielding ACC 0.903 (unsupervised thresholding) and 0.931 (supervised
thresholding) on the - Surface Seal Image - Test split with only 10% of
defective samples. The second applies a feature-distance approach using
Mahalanobis scoring on reduced latent features, providing high sensitivity to
distributional shifts for supervisory monitoring, achieving ACC 0.722 with
supervised thresholding. Together, these methods deliver complementary
capabilities: the first supports reliable inline inspection, while the second
enables scalable post-production surveillance and regulatory compliance
monitoring. Experimental results demonstrate that both approaches surpass
re-implemented baselines and provide a practical pathway for deploying deep
anomaly detection in regulated manufacturing environments, aligning accuracy,
efficiency, and the regulatory obligations defined for high-risk AI systems
under the EU AI Act.

*Tyler Ward,Abdullah Imran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Probabilistic SAM是SAM的概率扩展版本，通过引入潜在变量空间和变分训练目标，能够生成反映人类标注变异性的多样化分割掩码，特别适用于医学图像中存在标注不确定性的场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的可提示分割模型（如SAM）是确定性的，只能为每个提示生成单一分割结果，无法捕捉真实世界任务中存在的固有模糊性。这在医学成像中尤其成问题，因为标注不确定性或专家间变异性可能导致多个合理的分割结果。

Method: 在SAM框架中集成先验网络和后验网络，通过潜在变量空间调制提示嵌入，使用变分目标进行训练，学习生成多样化且合理的分割掩码分布。

Result: 在LIDC-IDRI肺结节数据集上的评估显示，Probabilistic SAM能够产生与专家分歧一致的多样化输出，在不确定性感知指标上优于现有的概率基线方法。

Conclusion: Probabilistic SAM通过概率建模成功解决了确定性分割模型无法处理标注不确定性的问题，为医学图像分割提供了不确定性感知的输出能力，推理时采样效率高且开销小。

Abstract: Recent advances in promptable segmentation, such as the Segment Anything
Model (SAM), have enabled flexible, high-quality mask generation across a wide
range of visual domains. However, SAM and similar models remain fundamentally
deterministic, producing a single segmentation per object per prompt, and fail
to capture the inherent ambiguity present in many real-world tasks. This
limitation is particularly troublesome in medical imaging, where multiple
plausible segmentations may exist due to annotation uncertainty or inter-expert
variability. In this paper, we introduce Probabilistic SAM, a probabilistic
extension of SAM that models a distribution over segmentations conditioned on
both the input image and prompt. By incorporating a latent variable space and
training with a variational objective, our model learns to generate diverse and
plausible segmentation masks reflecting the variability in human annotations.
The architecture integrates a prior and posterior network into the SAM
framework, allowing latent codes to modulate the prompt embeddings during
inference. The latent space allows for efficient sampling during inference,
enabling uncertainty-aware outputs with minimal overhead. We evaluate
Probabilistic SAM on the public LIDC-IDRI lung nodule dataset and demonstrate
its ability to produce diverse outputs that align with expert disagreement,
outperforming existing probabilistic baselines on uncertainty-aware metrics.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of carotid artery structures in histopathological
images is vital for advancing cardiovascular disease research and diagnosis.
However, deep learning model development in this domain is constrained by the
scarcity of annotated cardiovascular histopathological data. This study
investigates a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art deep learning
segmentation models, including convolutional neural networks (U-Net,
DeepLabV3+), a Vision Transformer (SegFormer), and recent foundation models
(SAM, MedSAM, MedSAM+UNet), on a limited dataset of cardiovascular histology
images. Despite employing an extensive hyperparameter optimization strategy
with Bayesian search, our findings reveal that model performance is highly
sensitive to data splits, with minor differences driven more by statistical
noise than by true algorithmic superiority. This instability exposes the
limitations of standard benchmarking practices in low-data clinical settings
and challenges the assumption that performance rankings reflect meaningful
clinical utility.

Conclusion: BTCChat通过创新的变化提取和提示增强机制，有效解决了双时相卫星图像分析中的时间建模和空间语义对齐问题，为城市发展监测和灾害评估等关键应用提供了更强大的工具。

Abstract: Bi-temporal satellite imagery supports critical applications such as urban
development monitoring and disaster assessment. Although powerful multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) have been applied in bi-temporal change analysis,
previous methods process image pairs through direct concatenation, inadequately
modeling temporal correlations and spatial semantic changes. This deficiency
hampers visual-semantic alignment in change understanding, thereby constraining
the overall effectiveness of current approaches. To address this gap, we
propose BTCChat, a multi-temporal MLLM with advanced bi-temporal change
understanding capability. BTCChat supports bi-temporal change captioning and
retains single-image interpretation capability. To better capture temporal
features and spatial semantic changes in image pairs, we design a Change
Extraction module. Moreover, to enhance the model's attention to spatial
details, we introduce a Prompt Augmentation mechanism, which incorporates
contextual clues into the prompt to enhance model performance. Experimental
results demonstrate that BTCChat achieves state-of-the-art performance on
change captioning and visual question answering tasks.

TL;DR: ViSK-GAT是一个新颖的多模态深度学习框架，结合视觉和骨骼坐标特征来分类肌肉骨骼风险，在复杂环境中实现了93.89%的测试准确率，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有肌肉骨骼风险评估方法大多依赖单一数据类型，在复杂环境中可靠性不足，需要开发能够融合多模态数据的可靠风险评估系统。

Method: 提出ViSK-GAT框架，结合残差块和轻量级Transformer块学习时空依赖关系，包含细粒度注意力模块（FGAM）进行跨模态特征精炼，以及多模态几何对应模块（MGCM）增强跨模态一致性。

Result: 验证准确率93.55%，测试准确率93.89%，精确率93.86%，F1分数93.85%，Cohen's Kappa和Matthews相关系数均为93%，均方根误差0.1205，平均绝对误差0.0156，优于9个流行的迁移学习骨干网络。

Conclusion: ViSK-GAT模型推动了人工智能在肌肉骨骼风险分类中的应用，能够实现有效的早期干预，为运动医学领域提供了重要的技术突破。

Abstract: Musculoskeletal disorders pose significant risks to athletes, and assessing
risk early is important for prevention. However, most existing methods are
designed for controlled settings and fail to reliably assess risk in complex
environments due to their reliance on a single type of data. This research
proposes ViSK-GAT (Visual-Skeletal Geometric Attention Transformer), a novel
multimodal deep learning framework designed to classify musculoskeletal risk
using visual and skeletal coordinate-based features. In addition, a custom
multimodal dataset is constructed by combining visual data and skeletal
coordinates for risk assessment. Each sample is labeled into eight risk
categories based on the Rapid Entire Body Assessment system. ViSK-GAT combines
a Residual Block with a Lightweight Transformer Block to learn spatial and
temporal dependencies jointly. It incorporates two novel modules: the
Fine-Grained Attention Module (FGAM), which enables precise inter-modal feature
refinement through cross-attention between visual and skeletal inputs, and the
Multimodal Geometric Correspondence Module (MGCM), which enhances cross-modal
coherence by aligning image features with coordinate-based representations.
ViSK-GAT achieved strong performance with validation and test accuracies of
93.55\% and 93.89\%, respectively; a precision of 93.86\%; an F1 score of
93.85\%; and Cohen's Kappa and Matthews Correlation Coefficient of 93\%. The
regression results also indicated a low Root Mean Square Error of the predicted
probability distribution of 0.1205 and a corresponding Mean Absolute Error of
0.0156. Compared to nine popular transfer learning backbones, ViSK-GAT
consistently outperformed previous methods. The ViSK-GAT model advances
artificial intelligence implementation and application, transforming
musculoskeletal risk classification and enabling impactful early interventions
in sports.

Motivation: 新兴应用更关注语义保持而非像素级重建，需要跨数据分布和下游任务的鲁棒性能，传统深度学习方法无法满足这些需求

Method: 利用多模态基础模型的零样本和表示能力，提出基于CLIP模型的语义压缩方法，压缩CLIP特征嵌入为最小比特同时保持跨任务语义信息

Result: 在基准数据集上保持语义完整性，平均比特率约2-3*10^-3 bpp，仅为主流图像压缩方法所需比特率的不到5%，在极端压缩下仍展现跨数据分布和下游任务的零样本鲁棒性

Conclusion: 该方法为语义压缩提供了新范式，在极低比特率下实现了优异的语义保持和跨任务鲁棒性

Abstract: Recent deep learning-based methods for lossy image compression achieve
competitive rate-distortion performance through extensive end-to-end training
and advanced architectures. However, emerging applications increasingly
prioritize semantic preservation over pixel-level reconstruction and demand
robust performance across diverse data distributions and downstream tasks.
These challenges call for advanced semantic compression paradigms. Motivated by
the zero-shot and representational capabilities of multimodal foundation
models, we propose a novel semantic compression method based on the contrastive
language-image pretraining (CLIP) model. Rather than compressing images for
reconstruction, we propose compressing the CLIP feature embeddings into minimal
bits while preserving semantic information across different tasks. Experiments
show that our method maintains semantic integrity across benchmark datasets,
achieving an average bit rate of approximately 2-3* 10(-3) bits per pixel. This
is less than 5% of the bitrate required by mainstream image compression
approaches for comparable performance. Remarkably, even under extreme
compression, the proposed approach exhibits zero-shot robustness across diverse
data distributions and downstream tasks.

Conclusion: 该方法使视觉语言预训练模型成为现实世界应用中更可行的解决方案，通过层次化视觉信息和动态提示机制有效提升了模型性能。

Abstract: The evolution of prompt learning methodologies has driven exploration of
deeper prompt designs to enhance model performance. However, current deep text
prompting approaches suffer from two critical limitations: Over-reliance on
constrastive learning objectives that prioritize high-level semantic alignment,
neglecting fine-grained feature optimization; Static prompts across all input
categories, preventing content-aware adaptation. To address these limitations,
we propose AttriPrompt-a novel framework that enhances and refines textual
semantic representations by leveraging the intermediate-layer features of
CLIP's vision encoder. We designed an Attribute Retrieval module that first
clusters visual features from each layer. The aggregated visual features
retrieve semantically similar prompts from a prompt pool, which are then
concatenated to the input of every layer in the text encoder. Leveraging
hierarchical visual information embedded in prompted text features, we
introduce Dual-stream Contrastive Learning to realize fine-grained alignment.
Furthermore, we introduce a Self-Regularization mechanism by applying explicit
regularization constraints between the prompted and non-prompted text features
to prevent overfitting on limited training data. Extensive experiments across
three benchmarks demonstrate AttriPrompt's superiority over state-of-the-art
methods, achieving up to 7.37\% improvement in the base-to-novel setting. The
observed strength of our method in cross-domain knowledge transfer positions
vision-language pre-trained models as more viable solutions for real-world
implementation.

Conclusion: 该研究为流匹配模型的强化学习应用提供了更有效的采样方法，解决了SDE基采样的噪声问题，提升了RL在图像生成中的性能

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has recently emerged as a powerful technique for
improving image and video generation in Diffusion and Flow Matching models,
specifically for enhancing output quality and alignment with prompts. A
critical step for applying online RL methods on Flow Matching is the
introduction of stochasticity into the deterministic framework, commonly
realized by Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE). Our investigation reveals a
significant drawback to this approach: SDE-based sampling introduces pronounced
noise artifacts in the generated images, which we found to be detrimental to
the reward learning process. A rigorous theoretical analysis traces the origin
of this noise to an excess of stochasticity injected during inference. To
address this, we draw inspiration from Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models
(DDIM) to reformulate the sampling process. Our proposed method,
Coefficients-Preserving Sampling (CPS), eliminates these noise artifacts. This
leads to more accurate reward modeling, ultimately enabling faster and more
stable convergence for reinforcement learning-based optimizers like Flow-GRPO
and Dance-GRPO. Code will be released at https://github.com/IamCreateAI/FlowCPS

Conclusion: DIFM模块能够有效利用原始和增强图像的互补信息，提升医学图像分割的准确性，特别是在边界区域的分割效果显著改善。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a crucial method for assisting professionals in
diagnosing various diseases through medical imaging. However, various factors
such as noise, blurriness, and low contrast often hinder the accurate diagnosis
of diseases. While numerous image enhancement techniques can mitigate these
issues, they may also alter crucial information needed for accurate diagnosis
in the original image. Conventional image fusion strategies, such as feature
concatenation can address this challenge. However, they struggle to fully
leverage the advantages of both original and enhanced images while suppressing
the side effects of the enhancements. To overcome the problem, we propose a
dual interactive fusion module (DIFM) that effectively exploits mutual
complementary information from the original and enhanced images. DIFM employs
cross-attention bidirectionally to simultaneously attend to corresponding
spatial information across different images, subsequently refining the
complementary features via global spatial attention. This interaction leverages
low- to high-level features implicitly associated with diverse structural
attributes like edges, blobs, and object shapes, resulting in enhanced features
that embody important spatial characteristics. In addition, we introduce a
multi-scale boundary loss based on gradient extraction to improve segmentation
accuracy at object boundaries. Experimental results on the ACDC and Synapse
datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method quantitatively and
qualitatively. Code available at: https://github.com/JJeong-Gari/DIN

integrates SAB with depthwise separable convolutions and a simple multiscale
fusion strategy, achieving end-to-end efficiency. Extensive experiments on the
KITTI dataset validate StripDet's superiority. With only 0.65M parameters, our
model achieves a 79.97% mAP for car detection, surpassing the baseline

Abstract: We propose a novel method to generate bloom lighting effect in real time
using neural networks. Our solution generate brightness mask from given 3D
scene view up to 30% faster than state-of-the-art methods. The existing
traditional techniques rely on multiple blur appliances and texture sampling,
also very often have existing conditional branching in its implementation.
These operations occupy big portion of the execution time. We solve this
problem by proposing two neural network-based bloom lighting methods, Neural
Bloom Lighting (NBL) and Fast Neural Bloom Lighting (FastNBL), focusing on
their quality and performance. Both methods were tested on a variety of 3D
scenes, with evaluations conducted on brightness mask accuracy and inference
speed. The main contribution of this work is that both methods produce
high-quality bloom effects while outperforming the standard state-of-the-art
bloom implementation, with FastNBL being faster by 28% and NBL faster by 12%.
These findings highlight that we can achieve realistic bloom lighting phenomena
faster, moving us towards more realism in real-time environments in the future.
This improvement saves computational resources, which is a major bottleneck in
real-time rendering. Furthermore, it is crucial for sustaining immersion and
ensuring smooth experiences in high FPS environments, while maintaining
high-quality realism.

Motivation: 解决当前从2D视觉域演化而来的自盛学习方法在3D医学形态中缺乏空间知识学习过程的直观性和医学可解释性问题。

Method: 设计了三个子任务来捐捕3D医学形态中的空间相关语义。这些任务遵循可观察原则确保可解释性，并尽可能减少因此导致的性能损失。利用3D形态提供的增强语义深度，包含多粒度空间关系建模以维持训练稳定性。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种可解释性强的3D医学形态自盛学习方法，有效解决了当前方法在医学可解释性方面的不足，为医疗安全和可靠性提供了有力支撑。

Abstract: The application of self-supervised techniques has become increasingly
prevalent within medical visualization tasks, primarily due to its capacity to
mitigate the data scarcity prevalent in the healthcare sector. The majority of
current works are influenced by designs originating in the generic 2D visual
domain, which lack the intuitive demonstration of the model's learning process
regarding 3D spatial knowledge. Consequently, these methods often fall short in
terms of medical interpretability. We propose a method consisting of three
sub-tasks to capture the spatially relevant semantics in medical 3D imaging.
Their design adheres to observable principles to ensure interpretability, and
minimize the performance loss caused thereby as much as possible. By leveraging
the enhanced semantic depth offered by the extra dimension in 3D imaging, this
approach incorporates multi-granularity spatial relationship modeling to
maintain training stability. Experimental findings suggest that our approach is
capable of delivering performance that is on par with current methodologies,
while facilitating an intuitive understanding of the self-supervised learning
process.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniStyle2通过去风格化方法构建大规模数据集DST-100K，训练出基于FLUX.1-dev的前馈模型，在艺术风格迁移任务中超越现有最佳方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决艺术风格迁移中缺乏真实监督数据的基本挑战，通过重新定义问题为数据问题

Method: 开发DST（文本引导去风格化模型）和DST-Filter（多阶段评估模型），构建DST-100K数据集，训练基于FLUX.1-dev的简单前馈模型

Result: 在定性和定量基准测试中一致超越最先进方法

Conclusion: 通过去风格化的可扩展数据生成提供了可靠的监督范式，克服了艺术风格迁移中缺乏真实数据的基本挑战

Abstract: OmniStyle2 introduces a novel approach to artistic style transfer by
reframing it as a data problem. Our key insight is destylization, reversing
style transfer by removing stylistic elements from artworks to recover natural,
style-free counterparts. This yields DST-100K, a large-scale dataset that
provides authentic supervision signals by aligning real artistic styles with
their underlying content. To build DST-100K, we develop (1) DST, a text-guided
destylization model that reconstructs stylefree content, and (2) DST-Filter, a
multi-stage evaluation model that employs Chain-of-Thought reasoning to
automatically discard low-quality pairs while ensuring content fidelity and
style accuracy. Leveraging DST-100K, we train OmniStyle2, a simple feed-forward
model based on FLUX.1-dev. Despite its simplicity, OmniStyle2 consistently
surpasses state-of-the-art methods across both qualitative and quantitative
benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that scalable data generation via
destylization provides a reliable supervision paradigm, overcoming the
fundamental challenge posed by the lack of ground-truth data in artistic style
transfer.

TL;DR: 提出ConstStyle方法，通过将训练和测试数据映射到统一域来减少域偏移影响，在域泛化任务中显著优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度神经网络在测试数据分布与训练数据不同时的性能下降问题，特别是当训练域有限或与未见域差距较大时

Method: 使用统一域捕获域不变特征并桥接域差距，训练时将样本映射到优化后的统一域，测试时类似投影后再进行预测

Result: 在多种场景下 consistently 优于现有方法，当只有有限seen domains时，准确率可比次优方法提升高达19.82%

Conclusion: ConstStyle通过统一域对齐有效减少了域偏移的影响，即使在大域差距或少量seen domains情况下也能显著提升域泛化性能

Abstract: Deep neural networks often suffer performance drops when test data
distribution differs from training data. Domain Generalization (DG) aims to
address this by focusing on domain-invariant features or augmenting data for
greater diversity. However, these methods often struggle with limited training
domains or significant gaps between seen (training) and unseen (test) domains.
To enhance DG robustness, we hypothesize that it is essential for the model to
be trained on data from domains that closely resemble unseen test domains-an
inherently difficult task due to the absence of prior knowledge about the
unseen domains. Accordingly, we propose ConstStyle, a novel approach that
leverages a unified domain to capture domain-invariant features and bridge the
domain gap with theoretical analysis. During training, all samples are mapped
onto this unified domain, optimized for seen domains. During testing, unseen
domain samples are projected similarly before predictions. By aligning both
training and testing data within this unified domain, ConstStyle effectively
reduces the impact of domain shifts, even with large domain gaps or few seen
domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConstStyle consistently
outperforms existing methods across diverse scenarios. Notably, when only a
limited number of seen domains are available, ConstStyle can boost accuracy up
to 19.82\% compared to the next best approach.

Motivation: 扩散模型在图像处理任务中展现出强大的生成能力，但如何有效处理稀疏视图CT重建中的缺失投影视图补全和全局信息建模仍是一个挑战。

Method: 提出联合训练机制、时间变化稀疏条件重加权引导策略、线性回归校正分布偏移，以及双网络并行架构进行多子频段组件的全局校正和优化。

Conclusion: STRIDE方法通过创新的引导策略和网络架构设计，在稀疏视图CT重建任务中实现了显著的性能提升，为高质量医学图像重建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable generative capabilities in
image processing tasks. We propose a Sparse condition Temporal Rewighted
Integrated Distribution Estimation guided diffusion model (STRIDE) for
sparse-view CT reconstruction. Specifically, we design a joint training
mechanism guided by sparse conditional probabilities to facilitate the model
effective learning of missing projection view completion and global information
modeling. Based on systematic theoretical analysis, we propose a temporally
varying sparse condition reweighting guidance strategy to dynamically adjusts
weights during the progressive denoising process from pure noise to the real
image, enabling the model to progressively perceive sparse-view information.
The linear regression is employed to correct distributional shifts between
known and generated data, mitigating inconsistencies arising during the
guidance process. Furthermore, we construct a dual-network parallel
architecture to perform global correction and optimization across multiple
sub-frequency components, thereby effectively improving the model capability in
both detail restoration and structural preservation, ultimately achieving
high-quality image reconstruction. Experimental results on both public and real
datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the best improvement of
2.58 dB in PSNR, increase of 2.37\% in SSIM, and reduction of 0.236 in MSE
compared to the best-performing baseline methods. The reconstructed images
exhibit excellent generalization and robustness in terms of structural
consistency, detail restoration, and artifact suppression.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单目3D物体检测因缺乏深度线索而具有挑战性，现有方法主要依靠CNN或Transformer提取特征，需要找到更有效的方法来提升检测准确性

Method: 采用解耦策略，将预计算的分割信息优先知识注入并融合到特征空间中，用于导向检测，无需扩大检测模型或共同学习分割任务

Result: 在KITTI 3D物体检测测试集上表现优于仅依赖RGB图像特征的等效架构，尤其在小物体（行人和自行车驾驶员）检测上显著提升

Conclusion: 证明了理解输入数据可以平衡对额外传感器或训练数据的需求，通过注入分割信息优先知识可以有效提升单目3D检测的性能

Abstract: Monocular 3D Object Detection represents a challenging Computer Vision task
due to the nature of the input used, which is a single 2D image, lacking in any
depth cues and placing the depth estimation problem as an ill-posed one.
Existing solutions leverage the information extracted from the input by using
Convolutional Neural Networks or Transformer architectures as feature
extraction backbones, followed by specific detection heads for 3D parameters
prediction. In this paper, we introduce a decoupled strategy based on injecting
precomputed segmentation information priors and fusing them directly into the
feature space for guiding the detection, without expanding the detection model
or jointly learning the priors. The focus is on evaluating the impact of
additional segmentation information on existing detection pipelines without
adding additional prediction branches. The proposed method is evaluated on the
KITTI 3D Object Detection Benchmark, outperforming the equivalent architecture
that relies only on RGB image features for small objects in the scene:
pedestrians and cyclists, and proving that understanding the input data can
balance the need for additional sensors or training data.

Motivation: 现有的单影像定位方法没有利用太空任务中的时间序列信息，需要抓取运动动态以提高性能

Method: 采用ViT编码器提取图像特征，结合预训练光流模型的运动线索，通过PnP法求解二维-三维对应关系来恢复6自由度位弊

Result: 在SPADES-RGB数据集上表现超过单影像基线方法，二维关键点定位和6-DoF位弊估计都有显著改善

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效抓取时序信息，在不同数据分布上都显示出较好的通用性，为太空设备定位提供了更加准确和稳健的解决方案

Abstract: Monocular 6-DoF pose estimation plays an important role in multiple
spacecraft missions. Most existing pose estimation approaches rely on single
images with static keypoint localisation, failing to exploit valuable temporal
information inherent to space operations. In this work, we adapt a deep
learning framework from human pose estimation to the spacecraft pose estimation
domain that integrates motion-aware heatmaps and optical flow to capture motion
dynamics. Our approach combines image features from a Vision Transformer (ViT)
encoder with motion cues from a pre-trained optical flow model to localise 2D
keypoints. Using the estimates, a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) solver recovers
6-DoF poses from known 2D-3D correspondences. We train and evaluate our method
on the SPADES-RGB dataset and further assess its generalisation on real and
synthetic data from the SPARK-2024 dataset. Overall, our approach demonstrates
improved performance over single-image baselines in both 2D keypoint
localisation and 6-DoF pose estimation. Furthermore, it shows promising
generalisation capabilities when testing on different data distributions.

Abstract: As global interest in diverse culinary experiences grows, food image models
are essential for improving food-related applications by enabling accurate food
recognition, recipe suggestions, dietary tracking, and automated meal planning.
Despite the abundance of food datasets, a noticeable gap remains in capturing
the nuances of Indian cuisine due to its vast regional diversity, complex
preparations, and the lack of comprehensive labeled datasets that cover its
full breadth. Through this exploration, we uncover Khana, a new benchmark
dataset for food image classification, segmentation, and retrieval of dishes
from Indian cuisine. Khana fills the gap by establishing a taxonomy of Indian
cuisine and offering around 131K images in the dataset spread across 80 labels,
each with a resolution of 500x500 pixels. This paper describes the dataset
creation process and evaluates state-of-the-art models on classification,
segmentation, and retrieval as baselines. Khana bridges the gap between
research and development by providing a comprehensive and challenging benchmark
for researchers while also serving as a valuable resource for developers
creating real-world applications that leverage the rich tapestry of Indian
cuisine. Webpage: https://khana.omkar.xyz

TL;DR: BLaVe-CoT是一个针对盲人和低视力用户的VQA框架，通过多候选答案生成和链式推理来处理视觉问答中的模糊性问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VQA系统假设单一答案和区域，但盲人和低视力用户拍摄的照片模糊、构图差，问题表述不明确，导致存在多个有效答案，需要系统能够处理这种模糊性

Method: 使用LoRA调优的BLIP-2模型生成多样候选答案，通过PolyFormer进行空间定位，最后应用链式推理模块评估答案是否指向相同或不同区域

Result: 在VQA-AnswerTherapy基准测试中优于先前方法，对辅助场景中常见的模糊性和视觉噪声更具鲁棒性

Conclusion: VQA系统需要适应真实人类的不确定性，为盲人和低视力用户提供包容性支持，该工作推动了相关研究和可访问性应用的发展

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) holds great potential for assisting Blind and
Low Vision (BLV) users, yet real-world usage remains challenging. Due to visual
impairments, BLV users often take blurry or poorly framed photos and face
difficulty in articulating specific questions about what they cannot fully see.
As a result, their visual questions are frequently ambiguous, and different
users may interpret them in diverse ways. This leads to multiple valid answers,
each grounded in different image regions-posing a mismatch with conventional
VQA systems that assume a single answer and region. To bridge this gap, we
present BLaVe-CoT, a VQA framework designed to reason about answer consistency
in the face of ambiguity. Our method proposes diverse candidate answers using a
LoRA-tuned BLIP-2 model, then grounds each answer spatially using PolyFormer,
and finally applies a chain-of-thought reasoning module to assess whether the
answers refer to the same or different regions. Evaluated on the
VQA-AnswerTherapy benchmark, BLaVe-CoT outperforms previous methods and proves
more robust to the ambiguity and visual noise common in assistive settings.
This work highlights the need for VQA systems that can adapt to real human
uncertainty and provide inclusive support for BLV users. To foster further
research and accessibility applications, we have made the code publicly
available at https://github.com/Accecwan/BLaVe-CoT.

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVD) has emerged as a pivotal technology
for applications involving Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). However, the
prevailing large-scale datasets for OVD pre-training are predominantly composed

engine. Then we construct and introduce UAVDE-2M(contains over 2,000,000
instances and 1800 categories) and UAVCAP-15k(contains over 15,000 images).
Furthermore, we propose a novel Cross-Attention Gated Enhancement Fusion (CAGE)

Conclusion: FDP框架通过排序机制有效编码微表情的动态信息，动态图像构建任务有助于捕捉面部细微动作并缓解数据稀缺问题，为微表情识别提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Facial micro-expression recognition (MER) is a challenging task, due to the
transience, subtlety, and dynamics of micro-expressions (MEs). Most existing
methods resort to hand-crafted features or deep networks, in which the former
often additionally requires key frames, and the latter suffers from small-scale
and low-diversity training data. In this paper, we develop a novel fine-grained
dynamic perception (FDP) framework for MER. We propose to rank frame-level
features of a sequence of raw frames in chronological order, in which the rank
process encodes the dynamic information of both ME appearances and motions.
Specifically, a novel local-global feature-aware transformer is proposed for
frame representation learning. A rank scorer is further adopted to calculate
rank scores of each frame-level feature. Afterwards, the rank features from
rank scorer are pooled in temporal dimension to capture dynamic representation.
Finally, the dynamic representation is shared by a MER module and a dynamic
image construction module, in which the former predicts the ME category, and
the latter uses an encoder-decoder structure to construct the dynamic image.
The design of dynamic image construction task is beneficial for capturing
facial subtle actions associated with MEs and alleviating the data scarcity
issue. Extensive experiments show that our method (i) significantly outperforms
the state-of-the-art MER methods, and (ii) works well for dynamic image
construction. Particularly, our FDP improves by 4.05%, 2.50%, 7.71%, and 2.11%
over the previous best results in terms of F1-score on the CASME II, SAMM,
CAS(ME)^2, and CAS(ME)^3 datasets, respectively. The code is available at

Abstract: Visual-LiDAR odometry is a critical component for autonomous system
localization, yet achieving high accuracy and strong robustness remains a
challenge. Traditional approaches commonly struggle with sensor misalignment,
fail to fully leverage temporal information, and require extensive manual
tuning to handle diverse sensor configurations. To address these problems, we
introduce DVLO4D, a novel visual-LiDAR odometry framework that leverages sparse
spatial-temporal fusion to enhance accuracy and robustness. Our approach
proposes three key innovations: (1) Sparse Query Fusion, which utilizes sparse
LiDAR queries for effective multi-modal data fusion; (2) a Temporal Interaction
and Update module that integrates temporally-predicted positions with current
frame data, providing better initialization values for pose estimation and
enhancing model's robustness against accumulative errors; and (3) a Temporal
Clip Training strategy combined with a Collective Average Loss mechanism that
aggregates losses across multiple frames, enabling global optimization and
reducing the scale drift over long sequences. Extensive experiments on the
KITTI and Argoverse Odometry dataset demonstrate the superiority of our
proposed DVLO4D, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both
pose accuracy and robustness. Additionally, our method has high efficiency,
with an inference time of 82 ms, possessing the potential for the real-time

relevant questions adapted to each blood report. The answers were then
processed using Sentence-BERT to compare and evaluate how closely the models
responded. The findings suggest that general-purpose VLMs are a practical and
promising technology for developing patient-facing tools for preliminary blood

Abstract: Automated inspection of transmission lines using UAVs is hindered by the
difficulty of detecting small and ambiguous defects against complex
backgrounds. Conventional detectors often suffer from detail loss due to
strided downsampling, weak boundary sensitivity in lightweight backbones, and
insufficient integration of global context with local cues. To address these
challenges, we propose TinyDef-DETR, a DETR-based framework designed for
small-defect detection. The method introduces a stride-free space-to-depth
module for lossless downsampling, an edge-enhanced convolution for
boundary-aware feature extraction, a cross-stage dual-domain multi-scale
attention module to jointly capture global and local information, and a
Focaler-Wise-SIoU regression loss to improve localization of small objects.
Experiments conducted on the CSG-ADCD dataset demonstrate that TinyDef-DETR
achieves substantial improvements in both precision and recall compared to
competitive baselines, with particularly notable gains on small-object subsets,
while incurring only modest computational overhead. Further validation on the
VisDrone benchmark confirms the generalization capability of the proposed
approach. Overall, the results indicate that integrating detail-preserving
downsampling, edge-sensitive representations, dual-domain attention, and
difficulty-adaptive regression provides a practical and efficient solution for
UAV-based small-defect inspection in power grids.

TL;DR: BranchGRPO通过分支采样策略优化GRPO方法，在保持探索多样性的同时显著降低计算成本，在图像和视频偏好对齐任务中提升对齐分数16%并减少50%训练时间


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GRPO方法存在高计算成本（on-policy rollout和过多SDE采样步骤）和训练不稳定（稀疏奖励）的问题，需要更高效的训练方法

Method: 提出分支采样策略更新SDE采样过程，包括：1）共享公共前缀计算；2）剪枝低奖励路径和冗余深度；3）树形优势估计器结合密集过程级奖励

Result: 在图像和视频偏好对齐实验中，BranchGRPO相比强基线提升对齐分数16%，同时减少50%训练时间

Conclusion: BranchGRPO通过创新的分支采样和剪枝策略，有效解决了GRPO方法的高计算成本和训练不稳定问题，在保持性能的同时显著提升训练效率

Abstract: Recent advancements in aligning image and video generative models via GRPO
have achieved remarkable gains in enhancing human preference alignment.
However, these methods still face high computational costs from on-policy
rollouts and excessive SDE sampling steps, as well as training instability due
to sparse rewards. In this paper, we propose BranchGRPO, a novel method that
introduces a branch sampling policy updating the SDE sampling process. By
sharing computation across common prefixes and pruning low-reward paths and
redundant depths, BranchGRPO substantially lowers the per-update compute cost
while maintaining or improving exploration diversity. This work makes three
main contributions: (1) a branch sampling scheme that reduces rollout and
training cost; (2) a tree-based advantage estimator incorporating dense
process-level rewards; and (3) pruning strategies exploiting path and depth
redundancy to accelerate convergence and boost performance. Experiments on
image and video preference alignment show that BranchGRPO improves alignment
scores by 16% over strong baselines, while cutting training time by 50%.

TL;DR: 提出一种新的多阶段图神经网结构，通过层次池化操作来模拟自然对流中的长程依赖关系，在网格流体动力学模拟中实现了更高的预测准确性和训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高保真度CFD模拟需要专家物理模型、细密网格和大量计算，限制了迭代速度。异常网格结构上的图神经网网络虽有开发澄新，但传统GNN在高分辨率图结构中捕捉长程依赖关系时遇到困难。

Method: 设计了一种新的多阶段GNN架构，利用层次池化和解池化操作，在多个空间尺度上逐步模拟从全局到局部的相互作用。在不同镰比矩形封闭空间中模拟自然对流的新CFD数据集上进行评估。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了多阶段GNN方法在网格流体动力学模拟中模拟复杂传热过程的潜力，为热设计提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Buoyancy-driven heat transfer in closed cavities serves as a canonical
testbed for thermal design High-fidelity CFD modelling yields accurate thermal
field solutions, yet its reliance on expert-crafted physics models, fine
meshes, and intensive computation limits rapid iteration. Recent developments
in data-driven modeling, especially Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), offer new
alternatives for learning thermal-fluid behavior directly from simulation data,
particularly on irregular mesh structures. However, conventional GNNs often
struggle to capture long-range dependencies in high-resolution graph
structures. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel multi-stage GNN
architecture that leverages hierarchical pooling and unpooling operations to
progressively model global-to-local interactions across multiple spatial
scales. We evaluate the proposed model on our newly developed CFD dataset
simulating natural convection within a rectangular cavities with varying aspect
ratios where the bottom wall is isothermal hot, the top wall is isothermal
cold, and the two vertical walls are adiabatic. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed model achieves higher predictive accuracy,
improved training efficiency, and reduced long-term error accumulation compared
to state-of-the-art (SOTA) GNN baselines. These findings underscore the
potential of the proposed multi-stage GNN approach for modeling complex heat
transfer in mesh-based fluid dynamics simulations.

Abstract: In this work, we develop a novel technique for reconstructing images from
projection-based nano- and microtomography. Our contribution focuses on
enhancing reconstruction quality, particularly for specimen composed of
homogeneous material phases connected by sharp edges. This is accomplished by
training a neural network to identify edges within subpictures. The trained
network is then integrated into a mathematical optimization model, to reduce
artifacts from previous reconstructions. To this end, the optimization approach
favors solutions according to the learned predictions, however may also
determine alternative solutions if these are strongly supported by the raw
data. Hence, our technique successfully incorporates knowledge about the
homogeneity and presence of sharp edges in the sample and thereby eliminates
blurriness. Our results on experimental datasets show significant enhancements
in interface sharpness and material homogeneity compared to benchmark
algorithms. Thus, our technique produces high-quality reconstructions,
showcasing its potential for advancing tomographic imaging techniques.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedSeqFT是一个顺序微调框架，通过MDS样本选择和K&G RFT知识蒸馏方案，在医学图像分割任务中实现了3.0%的平均Dice提升，并增强了模型的可迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有微调策略存在局限性：并行微调隔离任务无法利用共享知识，多任务微调需要同时访问所有数据集且难以增量集成新任务。需要一种能够顺序适应新任务同时保持预训练知识的框架。

Method: 提出MedSeqFT顺序微调框架，包含两个核心组件：1) MDS选择 - 识别最能代表原始预训练分布的下游样本以保持通用知识；2) K&G RFT - 基于LoRA的知识蒸馏方案，平衡任务特定适应与预训练知识保留。

Result: 在10个3D分割任务的两个多任务数据集上，MedSeqFT始终优于最先进的微调策略，平均Dice提升3.0%。在COVID-19-20和肾脏两个未见任务上的评估验证了其增强的可迁移性，特别是在肿瘤分割方面。

Conclusion: MedSeqFT建立了一个有效且知识保持的顺序微调范式，用于将基础模型适应不断发展的临床任务，损失景观和参数变化的可视化分析进一步证明了其鲁棒性。

Abstract: Foundation models have become a promising paradigm for advancing medical
image analysis, particularly for segmentation tasks where downstream
applications often emerge sequentially. Existing fine-tuning strategies,
however, remain limited: parallel fine-tuning isolates tasks and fails to
exploit shared knowledge, while multi-task fine-tuning requires simultaneous
access to all datasets and struggles with incremental task integration. To
address these challenges, we propose MedSeqFT, a sequential fine-tuning
framework that progressively adapts pre-trained models to new tasks while
refining their representational capacity. MedSeqFT introduces two core
components: (1) Maximum Data Similarity (MDS) selection, which identifies
downstream samples most representative of the original pre-training
distribution to preserve general knowledge, and (2) Knowledge and
Generalization Retention Fine-Tuning (K&G RFT), a LoRA-based knowledge
distillation scheme that balances task-specific adaptation with the retention
of pre-trained knowledge. Extensive experiments on two multi-task datasets
covering ten 3D segmentation tasks demonstrate that MedSeqFT consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art fine-tuning strategies, yielding substantial
performance gains (e.g., an average Dice improvement of 3.0%). Furthermore,
evaluations on two unseen tasks (COVID-19-20 and Kidney) verify that MedSeqFT
enhances transferability, particularly for tumor segmentation. Visual analyses
of loss landscapes and parameter variations further highlight the robustness of
MedSeqFT. These results establish sequential fine-tuning as an effective,
knowledge-retentive paradigm for adapting foundation models to evolving
clinical tasks. Code will be released.

Conclusion: 所提出的病理特异性训练方案有效解决了现有模型在复杂跨模态关系建模方面的局限性，显著提升了病理图像分析的准确性和临床应用价值

Abstract: Accurate analysis of pathological images is essential for automated tumor
diagnosis but remains challenging due to high structural similarity and subtle
morphological variations in tissue images. Current vision-language (VL) models
often struggle to capture the complex reasoning required for interpreting
structured pathological reports. To address these limitations, we propose
PathoHR-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate VL models' abilities in
hierarchical semantic understanding and compositional reasoning within the
pathology domain. Results of this benchmark reveal that existing VL models fail
to effectively model intricate cross-modal relationships, hence limiting their
applicability in clinical setting. To overcome this, we further introduce a
pathology-specific VL training scheme that generates enhanced and perturbed
samples for multimodal contrastive learning. Experimental evaluations
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on
PathoHR-Bench and six additional pathology datasets, highlighting its
effectiveness in fine-grained pathology representation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动图像聚类是计算机视觉的基础，但在图像增强应用中受限，主要因为难以定义对该任务有意义的聚类。

Method: 提出CARDIE无监督算法，基于图像的颜色和亮度内容进行聚类，并引入量化图像增强算法对亮度分布和局部方差影响的方法。

Result: CARDIE产生的聚类比基于语义图像属性的聚类更适用于图像增强，利用这些聚类重采样数据集能提高色调映射和去噪算法的性能。

Conclusion: CARDIE为图像增强任务提供了更有效的聚类方法，代码已公开以促进采用和确保可重现性。

Abstract: Automatic image clustering is a cornerstone of computer vision, yet its
application to image enhancement remains limited, primarily due to the
difficulty of defining clusters that are meaningful for this specific task. To
address this issue, we introduce CARDIE, an unsupervised algorithm that
clusters images based on their color and luminosity content. In addition, we
introduce a method to quantify the impact of image enhancement algorithms on
luminance distribution and local variance. Using this method, we demonstrate
that CARDIE produces clusters more relevant to image enhancement than those
derived from semantic image attributes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CARDIE
clusters can be leveraged to resample image enhancement datasets, leading to
improved performance for tone mapping and denoising algorithms. To encourage
adoption and ensure reproducibility, we publicly release CARDIE code on our
GitHub.

TL;DR: SpecSwin3D是一个基于Transformer的模型，能够从多光谱输入生成高光谱图像，同时保持空间和光谱质量，在PSNR、SAM和SSIM指标上显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多光谱和高光谱图像在农业、环境监测等领域有广泛应用，但存在空间分辨率与光谱分辨率的权衡问题。现有方法难以同时保持空间细节和光谱保真度。

Method: 提出SpecSwin3D模型，采用3D移位窗口Transformer框架，输入5个多光谱波段，重建224个高光谱波段。引入级联训练策略和优化的波段序列设计。

Result: 模型达到PSNR 35.82dB、SAM 2.40°、SSIM 0.96，比基线MHF-Net提升5.6dB PSNR，ERGAS降低一半以上。在下游任务中表现出实用价值。

Conclusion: SpecSwin3D成功解决了多光谱到高光谱转换中的空间-光谱权衡问题，为遥感图像处理提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multispectral and hyperspectral imagery are widely used in agriculture,
environmental monitoring, and urban planning due to their complementary spatial
and spectral characteristics. A fundamental trade-off persists: multispectral
imagery offers high spatial but limited spectral resolution, while
hyperspectral imagery provides rich spectra at lower spatial resolution. Prior
hyperspectral generation approaches (e.g., pan-sharpening variants, matrix
factorization, CNNs) often struggle to jointly preserve spatial detail and
spectral fidelity. In response, we propose SpecSwin3D, a transformer-based
model that generates hyperspectral imagery from multispectral inputs while
preserving both spatial and spectral quality. Specifically, SpecSwin3D takes
five multispectral bands as input and reconstructs 224 hyperspectral bands at
the same spatial resolution. In addition, we observe that reconstruction errors
grow for hyperspectral bands spectrally distant from the input bands. To
address this, we introduce a cascade training strategy that progressively
expands the spectral range to stabilize learning and improve fidelity.
Moreover, we design an optimized band sequence that strategically repeats and
orders the five selected multispectral bands to better capture pairwise
relations within a 3D shifted-window transformer framework. Quantitatively, our
model achieves a PSNR of 35.82 dB, SAM of 2.40{\deg}, and SSIM of 0.96,
outperforming the baseline MHF-Net by +5.6 dB in PSNR and reducing ERGAS by
more than half. Beyond reconstruction, we further demonstrate the practical
value of SpecSwin3D on two downstream tasks, including land use classification
and burnt area segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI可以从医学图像中提取敏感的生物标志物（如视网膜年龄），这带来了严重的隐私风险，未经授权使用可能导致生物信息泄露。

Method: 采用特征级生成对抗掩蔽机制，结合多对一知识蒸馏策略，利用视网膜基础模型和多样化的替代年龄编码器来防御黑盒年龄预测模型。

Result: 综合评估证实RetinaGuard成功混淆了视网膜年龄预测，对图像质量和病理特征表示的影响最小。

Conclusion: RetinaGuard有效解决了医学图像生物特征隐私问题，且可灵活扩展到其他医学图像生物标志物的隐私保护。

Abstract: The integration of AI with medical images enables the extraction of implicit
image-derived biomarkers for a precise health assessment. Recently, retinal
age, a biomarker predicted from fundus images, is a proven predictor of
systemic disease risks, behavioral patterns, aging trajectory and even
mortality. However, the capability to infer such sensitive biometric data
raises significant privacy risks, where unauthorized use of fundus images could
lead to bioinformation leakage, breaching individual privacy. In response, we
formulate a new research problem of biometric privacy associated with medical
images and propose RetinaGuard, a novel privacy-enhancing framework that
employs a feature-level generative adversarial masking mechanism to obscure
retinal age while preserving image visual quality and disease diagnostic
utility. The framework further utilizes a novel multiple-to-one knowledge
distillation strategy incorporating a retinal foundation model and diverse
surrogate age encoders to enable a universal defense against black-box age
prediction models. Comprehensive evaluations confirm that RetinaGuard
successfully obfuscates retinal age prediction with minimal impact on image
quality and pathological feature representation. RetinaGuard is also flexible
for extension to other medical image derived biomarkers. RetinaGuard is also
flexible for extension to other medical image biomarkers.

Conclusion: UniVerse-1通过创新的模型架构和标注策略，有效提升了音频-视频生成的协调性和对齐精度，为多模态生成研究提供了有价值的工具和基准。

Abstract: We introduce UniVerse-1, a unified, Veo-3-like model capable of
simultaneously generating coordinated audio and video. To enhance training
efficiency, we bypass training from scratch and instead employ a stitching of
experts (SoE) technique. This approach deeply fuses the corresponding blocks of
pre-trained video and music generation experts models, thereby fully leveraging
their foundational capabilities. To ensure accurate annotations and temporal
alignment for both ambient sounds and speech with video content, we developed
an online annotation pipeline that processes the required training data and
generates labels during training process. This strategy circumvents the
performance degradation often caused by misalignment text-based annotations.
Through the synergy of these techniques, our model, after being finetuned on
approximately 7,600 hours of audio-video data, produces results with
well-coordinated audio-visuals for ambient sounds generation and strong
alignment for speech generation. To systematically evaluate our proposed
method, we introduce Verse-Bench, a new benchmark dataset. In an effort to
advance research in audio-video generation and to close the performance gap
with state-of-the-art models such as Veo3, we make our model and code publicly
available. We hope this contribution will benefit the broader research
community. Project page: https://dorniwang.github.io/UniVerse-1/.

Motivation: 现有的视频场景图生成方法通常针对特定粒度（边界框或像素级别）设计，需要任务特定的架构和多阶段训练流程，缺乏统一的解决方案。

Method: 提出UNO框架，使用扩展的slot attention机制将视觉特征分解为物体和关系slot，引入物体时序一致性学习确保跨帧表示一致性，并通过动态三元组预测模块捕捉时序交互。

Conclusion: UNO证明了统一框架在视频场景图生成任务中的有效性，能够以最小任务特定修改实现多粒度视觉内容建模，为视频理解提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Video Scene Graph Generation (VidSGG) aims to represent dynamic visual
content by detecting objects and modeling their temporal interactions as
structured graphs. Prior studies typically target either coarse-grained
box-level or fine-grained panoptic pixel-level VidSGG, often requiring
task-specific architectures and multi-stage training pipelines. In this paper,
we present UNO (UNified Object-centric VidSGG), a single-stage, unified
framework that jointly addresses both tasks within an end-to-end architecture.
UNO is designed to minimize task-specific modifications and maximize parameter
sharing, enabling generalization across different levels of visual granularity.
The core of UNO is an extended slot attention mechanism that decomposes visual
features into object and relation slots. To ensure robust temporal modeling, we
introduce object temporal consistency learning, which enforces consistent
object representations across frames without relying on explicit tracking
modules. Additionally, a dynamic triplet prediction module links relation slots
to corresponding object pairs, capturing evolving interactions over time. We
evaluate UNO on standard box-level and pixel-level VidSGG benchmarks. Results
demonstrate that UNO not only achieves competitive performance across both
tasks but also offers improved efficiency through a unified, object-centric
design.

Abstract: Bone fractures present a major global health challenge, often resulting in
pain, reduced mobility, and productivity loss, particularly in low-resource
settings where access to expert radiology services is limited. Conventional
imaging methods suffer from high costs, radiation exposure, and dependency on
specialized interpretation. To address this, we developed an AI-based solution
for automated fracture detection from X-ray images using a custom Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) and benchmarked it against transfer learning models
including EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV2, and ResNet50. Training was conducted on
the publicly available FracAtlas dataset, comprising 4,083 anonymized
musculoskeletal radiographs. The custom CNN achieved 95.96% accuracy, 0.94
precision, 0.88 recall, and an F1-score of 0.91 on the FracAtlas dataset.
Although transfer learning models (EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV2, ResNet50)
performed poorly in this specific setup, these results should be interpreted in
light of class imbalance and data set limitations. This work highlights the
promise of lightweight CNNs for detecting fractures in X-rays and underscores
the importance of fair benchmarking, diverse datasets, and external validation
for clinical translation

Abstract: Object Recognition and Document Skew Estimation have come a long way in terms
of performance and efficiency. New models follow one of two directions:
improving performance using larger models, and improving efficiency using
smaller models. However, real-time document detection and rectification is a
niche that is largely unexplored by the literature, yet it remains a vital step
for automatic information retrieval from visual documents. In this work, we
strive towards an efficient document detection pipeline that is satisfactory in
terms of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) retrieval and faster than other
available solutions. We adapt IWPOD-Net, a license plate detection network, and
train it for detection on NBID, a synthetic ID card dataset. We experiment with
data augmentation and cross-dataset validation with MIDV (another synthetic ID
and passport document dataset) to find the optimal scenario for the model.
Other methods from both the Object Recognition and Skew Estimation
state-of-the-art are evaluated for comparison with our approach. We use each
method to detect and rectify the document, which is then read by an OCR system.
The OCR output is then evaluated using a novel OCR quality metric based on the
Levenshtein distance. Since the end goal is to improve automatic information
retrieval, we use the overall OCR quality as a performance metric. We observe
that with a promising model, document rectification does not have to be perfect
to attain state-of-the-art performance scores. We show that our model is
smaller and more efficient than current state-of-the-art solutions while
retaining a competitive OCR quality metric. All code is available at

Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Prior work has addressed this issue by creating
spatial question-answering (QA) datasets based on single images or indoor
videos. However, real-world embodied AI agents such as robots and self-driving
cars typically rely on ego-centric, multi-view observations. To this end, we
introduce Ego3D-Bench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the spatial
reasoning abilities of VLMs using ego-centric, multi-view outdoor data.
Ego3D-Bench comprises over 8,600 QA pairs, created with significant involvement
from human annotators to ensure quality and diversity. We benchmark 16 SOTA
VLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini1.5-Pro, InternVL3, and Qwen2.5-VL. Our results
reveal a notable performance gap between human level scores and VLM
performance, highlighting that current VLMs still fall short of human level
spatial understanding. To bridge this gap, we propose Ego3D-VLM, a
post-training framework that enhances 3D spatial reasoning of VLMs. Ego3D-VLM
generates cognitive map based on estimated global 3D coordinates, resulting in
12% average improvement on multi-choice QA and 56% average improvement on
absolute distance estimation. Ego3D-VLM is modular and can be integrated with
any existing VLM. Together, Ego3D-Bench and Ego3D-VLM offer valuable tools for
advancing toward human level spatial understanding in real-world, multi-view
environments.

TL;DR: 提出基于自拍面部图像远程估计皮肤水合度和经皮水分流失的系统性解决方案，使用Skin-Prior Adaptive Vision Transformer模型，解决数据标注不平衡问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 皮肤屏障功能的定量指标（SH和TEWL）对皮肤健康监测很重要，但传统测量需要专业仪器，普通用户难以获得。需要开发从自拍图像远程估计这些指标的方法

Method: 多阶段解决方案：包括SH/TEWL数据收集、数据预处理、提出新颖的Skin-Prior Adaptive Vision Transformer模型进行回归，并使用对称对比正则化减少数据不平衡导致的模型偏差

Result: 首次探索从自拍面部图像进行皮肤评估而无需物理测量，有效解决了SH/TEWL数据标注不平衡问题

Conclusion: 该研究填补了计算机视觉与皮肤护理研究之间的空白，为更广泛的实际应用实现了AI驱动的可访问皮肤分析

Abstract: Skin health and disease resistance are closely linked to the skin barrier
function, which protects against environmental factors and water loss. Two key
physiological indicators can quantitatively represent this barrier function:
skin hydration (SH) and trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL). Measurement of SH
and TEWL is valuable for the public to monitor skin conditions regularly,
diagnose dermatological issues, and personalize their skincare regimens.
However, these measurements are not easily accessible to general users unless
they visit a dermatology clinic with specialized instruments. To tackle this
problem, we propose a systematic solution to estimate SH and TEWL from selfie
facial images remotely with smartphones. Our solution encompasses multiple
stages, including SH/TEWL data collection, data preprocessing, and formulating
a novel Skin-Prior Adaptive Vision Transformer model for SH/TEWL regression.
Through experiments, we identified the annotation imbalance of the SH/TEWL data
and proposed a symmetric-based contrastive regularization to reduce the model
bias due to the imbalance effectively. This work is the first study to explore
skin assessment from selfie facial images without physical measurements. It
bridges the gap between computer vision and skin care research, enabling
AI-driven accessible skin analysis for broader real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了PAML框架，通过原型感知多模态学习解决视觉定位在开放词汇场景中的三个关键挑战：模态对齐不足、跨模态特征融合不充分、语义原型信息利用不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于transformer的方法在标准场景中定位性能良好，但在开放词汇场景（包含训练时未见的新颖对象类别）中存在显著局限性，主要由于三个关键因素：视觉与语言模态对齐不完美、跨模态特征融合不足、语义原型信息利用无效。

Method: PAML框架包含：使用ALBEF进行初始跨模态对齐编码；视觉判别特征编码器选择性增强显著对象表示；新颖的原型发现和继承机制提取聚合多邻居语义原型；多阶段解码器进行综合多模态整合和边界框回归。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上的广泛实验验证了该方法，在标准场景中表现出竞争性性能，在开放词汇场景中实现了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: PAML框架通过系统性解决跨模态对齐、特征融合和原型利用问题，显著提升了开放词汇视觉定位的性能，为处理新颖对象类别提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Visual Grounding (VG) aims to utilize given natural language queries to
locate specific target objects within images. While current transformer-based
approaches demonstrate strong localization performance in standard scene (i.e,
scenarios without any novel objects), they exhibit notable limitations in
open-vocabulary scene (i.e, both familiar and novel object categories during
testing). These limitations primarily stem from three key factors: (1)
imperfect alignment between visual and linguistic modalities, (2) insufficient
cross-modal feature fusion, and (3) ineffective utilization of semantic
prototype information. To overcome these challenges, we present Prototype-Aware
Multimodal Learning (PAML), an innovative framework that systematically
addresses these issues through several key components: First, we leverage ALBEF
to establish robust cross-modal alignment during initial feature encoding.
Subsequently, our Visual Discriminative Feature Encoder selectively enhances
salient object representations while suppressing irrelevant visual context. The
framework then incorporates a novel prototype discovering and inheriting
mechanism that extracts and aggregates multi-neighbor semantic prototypes to
facilitate open-vocabulary recognition. These enriched features undergo
comprehensive multimodal integration through our Multi-stage Decoder before
final bounding box regression. Extensive experiments across five benchmark
datasets validate our approach, showing competitive performance in standard
scene while achieving state-of-the-art results in open-vocabulary scene. Our
code is available at https://github.com/plankXie/PAML.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文将广义类别发现(GCD)扩展到视频领域，提出视频GCD新设置，并设计了内存导向的一致性对比学习框架(MCCL)来利用时空信息提高新类别发现的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GCD方法主要关注静态图像，但仅靠静态视觉内容不能可靠地发现新类别。需要将GCD扩展到视频领域，利用时间维度信息来提升新类发现的性能。

Method: 提出MCCL框架，包含两个核心组件：一致性对比学习(CACL)和内存导向表征增强(MGRE)。CACL利用多视角时间特征估计一致性分数，并用于加权对比损失。MGRE通过双级内存缓冲区维护特征层和逻辑层表征，提供全局上下文。

Result: 在行为识别和鸟类分类视频数据集上进行了涉及广泛实验，结果显示方法显著超过了来自图像设置的竞争性GCD方法，证明了时间信息对视频中新类别发现的重要性。

Conclusion: 本文成功将GCD扩展到视频领域，提出的MCCL框架通过有效整合时空信息显著提升了新类别发现的性能，为视频领域的开放世界分类问题提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) is an emerging and challenging
open-world problem that has garnered increasing attention in recent years. Most
existing GCD methods focus on discovering categories in static images. However,
relying solely on static visual content is often insufficient to reliably
discover novel categories. To bridge this gap, we extend the GCD problem to the
video domain and introduce a new setting, termed Video-GCD. Thus, effectively
integrating multi-perspective information across time is crucial for accurate
Video-GCD. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel Memory-guided
Consistency-aware Contrastive Learning (MCCL) framework, which explicitly
captures temporal-spatial cues and incorporates them into contrastive learning
through a consistency-guided voting mechanism. MCCL consists of two core
components: Consistency-Aware Contrastive Learning(CACL) and Memory-Guided
Representation Enhancement (MGRE). CACL exploits multiperspective temporal
features to estimate consistency scores between unlabeled instances, which are
then used to weight the contrastive loss accordingly. MGRE introduces a
dual-level memory buffer that maintains both feature-level and logit-level
representations, providing global context to enhance intra-class compactness
and inter-class separability. This in turn refines the consistency estimation
in CACL, forming a mutually reinforcing feedback loop between representation
learning and consistency modeling. To facilitate a comprehensive evaluation, we
construct a new and challenging Video-GCD benchmark, which includes action
recognition and bird classification video datasets. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms competitive GCD
approaches adapted from image-based settings, highlighting the importance of
temporal information for discovering novel categories in videos. The code will
be publicly available.

TL;DR: 本文提出Text4Seg++模型，通过文本作为掩码的新范式，将图像分割转换为文本生成问题，无需额外解码器，在多个视觉任务上达到独创性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉-语言任务中表现突出，但有效整合图像分割仍面临挑战。需要一种简洁、高效的方法来将分割插入MLLM框架。

Method: 提出语义描述符作为分割掩码的文本表示：1）图像级语义描述符；2）行向跐长编码（R-RLE）压缩技术；3）框级语义描述符和语义砖结构，将分割形式化为下一个砖预测任务。

Result: 在自然图像和遥感数据集上，Text4Seg++在多个标准测试集上一致超过最先进模型，无需任务特定微调，保持与现有MLLM背榜的兼容性。R-RLE技术将描述符长度减少74%，推理速度提升3倍。

Conclusion: 该工作证明了在MLLM框架内通过文本驱动方式进行图像分割的有效性、可扩展性和通用性，为简化分割过程开启了新方向。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown exceptional capabilities
in vision-language tasks. However, effectively integrating image segmentation
into these models remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a
novel text-as-mask paradigm that casts image segmentation as a text generation
problem, eliminating the need for additional decoders and significantly
simplifying the segmentation process. Our key innovation is semantic
descriptors, a new textual representation of segmentation masks where each
image patch is mapped to its corresponding text label. We first introduce
image-wise semantic descriptors, a patch-aligned textual representation of
segmentation masks that integrates naturally into the language modeling
pipeline. To enhance efficiency, we introduce the Row-wise Run-Length Encoding
(R-RLE), which compresses redundant text sequences, reducing the length of
semantic descriptors by 74% and accelerating inference by $3\times$, without
compromising performance. Building upon this, our initial framework Text4Seg
achieves strong segmentation performance across a wide range of vision tasks.
To further improve granularity and compactness, we propose box-wise semantic
descriptors, which localizes regions of interest using bounding boxes and
represents region masks via structured mask tokens called semantic bricks. This
leads to our refined model, Text4Seg++, which formulates segmentation as a
next-brick prediction task, combining precision, scalability, and generative
efficiency. Comprehensive experiments on natural and remote sensing datasets
show that Text4Seg++ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models across
diverse benchmarks without any task-specific fine-tuning, while remaining
compatible with existing MLLM backbones. Our work highlights the effectiveness,
scalability, and generalizability of text-driven image segmentation within the
MLLM framework.

Abstract: The precise characterization of plant morphology provides valuable insights
into plant environment interactions and genetic evolution. A key technology for
extracting this information is 3D segmentation, which delineates individual
plant organs from complex point clouds. Despite significant progress in general
3D computer vision domains, the adoption of 3D segmentation for plant
phenotyping remains limited by three major challenges: i) the scarcity of
large-scale annotated datasets, ii) technical difficulties in adapting advanced
deep neural networks to plant point clouds, and iii) the lack of standardized
benchmarks and evaluation protocols tailored to plant science. This review
systematically addresses these barriers by: i) providing an overview of
existing 3D plant datasets in the context of general 3D segmentation domains,
ii) systematically summarizing deep learning-based methods for point cloud
semantic and instance segmentation, iii) introducing Plant Segmentation Studio
(PSS), an open-source framework for reproducible benchmarking, and iv)
conducting extensive quantitative experiments to evaluate representative
networks and sim-to-real learning strategies. Our findings highlight the
efficacy of sparse convolutional backbones and transformer-based instance
segmentation, while also emphasizing the complementary role of modeling-based
and augmentation-based synthetic data generation for sim-to-real learning in
reducing annotation demands. In general, this study bridges the gap between
algorithmic advances and practical deployment, providing immediate tools for
researchers and a roadmap for developing data-efficient and generalizable deep
learning solutions in 3D plant phenotyping. Data and code are available at

Abstract: Currency recognition systems often overlook usability and authenticity
assessment, especially in low-resource environments where visually impaired
users and offline validation are common. While existing methods focus on
denomination classification, they typically ignore physical degradation and
forgery, limiting their applicability in real-world conditions. This paper
presents a unified framework for currency evaluation that integrates three
modules: denomination classification using lightweight CNN models, damage
quantification through a novel Unified Currency Damage Index (UCDI), and
counterfeit detection using feature-based template matching. The dataset
consists of over 82,000 annotated images spanning clean, damaged, and
counterfeit notes. Our Custom_CNN model achieves high classification
performance with low parameter count. The UCDI metric provides a continuous
usability score based on binary mask loss, chromatic distortion, and structural
feature loss. The counterfeit detection module demonstrates reliable
identification of forged notes across varied imaging conditions. The framework
supports real-time, on-device inference and addresses key deployment challenges
in constrained environments. Results show that accurate, interpretable, and
compact solutions can support inclusive currency evaluation in practical
settings.

challenging in poor lighting, adverse weather, and unbalanced data sets. This
paper presents a multimodal detection framework that integrates RGB and thermal
infrared imaging with a fine-tuned YOLOv8 model. Training leveraged KITTI,
BDD100K, and Teledyne FLIR datasets, with class re-weighting and light
augmentations to improve minority-class performance and robustness, experiments
show that 640-pixel resolution and partial backbone freezing optimise accuracy

Motivation: 时间敏感视频理解任务可以从帧内基础物体中获益，但传统的文本注释方式会导致标记长度增加和容易受噪声影响。

Method: 设计GO-Tokenizer模块，利用现成的物体检测器实时编码紧凑的物体信息，作为Video-LLMs的轻量添加模块。

Result: 实验结果显示，使用GO-Tokenizer预训练的模型在性能上超过原始Video-LLM和使用文本描述的对照模型。

Conclusion: GO-Tokenizer能够在不同模型、数据集和视频理解任务中广泛提升性能，为时间敏感视频理解提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose to improve the time-sensitive video understanding (TSV) capability
of video large language models (Video-LLMs) with grounded objects (GO). We
hypothesize that TSV tasks can benefit from GO within frames, which is
supported by our preliminary experiments on LITA, a state-of-the-art Video-LLM
for reasoning temporal localization. While augmenting prompts with textual
description of these object annotations improves the performance of LITA, it
also introduces extra token length and susceptibility to the noise in object
level information. To address this, we propose GO-Tokenizer, a lightweight
add-on module for Video-LLMs leveraging off-the-shelf object detectors to
encode compact object information on the fly. Experimental results demonstrate
that pretraining with GO-Tokenizer outperforms the vanilla Video-LLM and its
counterpart utilizing textual description of objects in the prompt. The gain
generalizes across different models, datasets and video understanding tasks
such as reasoning temporal localization and dense captioning.

Motivation: 现有的基于CLIP的面部防伪方法未能充分利用CLIP的补丁嵌入标记，且依赖单一文本提示，限制了泛化能力。

Method: 提出MVP-FAS框架，包含多视角槽注意力(MVS)和多文本补丁对齐(MTPA)两个模块，利用多个释义文本生成泛化特征。

Result: 在跨域数据集上超越了之前的最先进方法，表现出优异的泛化性能。

Conclusion: MVP-FAS通过多文本表示和补丁对齐有效提升了面部防伪的跨域泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent face anti-spoofing (FAS) methods have shown remarkable cross-domain
performance by employing vision-language models like CLIP. However, existing
CLIP-based FAS models do not fully exploit CLIP's patch embedding tokens,
failing to detect critical spoofing clues. Moreover, these models rely on a
single text prompt per class (e.g., 'live' or 'fake'), which limits
generalization. To address these issues, we propose MVP-FAS, a novel framework
incorporating two key modules: Multi-View Slot attention (MVS) and Multi-Text
Patch Alignment (MTPA). Both modules utilize multiple paraphrased texts to
generate generalized features and reduce dependence on domain-specific text.
MVS extracts local detailed spatial features and global context from patch
embeddings by leveraging diverse texts with multiple perspectives. MTPA aligns
patches with multiple text representations to improve semantic robustness.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVP-FAS achieves superior generalization
performance, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods on cross-domain
datasets. Code: https://github.com/Elune001/MVP-FAS.

Abstract: Colorectal diseases, including inflammatory conditions and neoplasms, require
quick, accurate care to be effectively treated. Traditional diagnostic
pipelines require extensive preparation and rely on separate, individual
evaluations on histological images and colonoscopy footage, introducing
possible variability and inefficiencies. This pilot study proposes a unified
deep learning network that uses convolutional neural networks (CN N s) to
classify both histopathological slides and colonoscopy video frames in one
pipeline. The pipeline integrates class-balancing learning, robust
augmentation, and calibration methods to ensure accurate results. Static colon
histology images were taken from the PathMNIST dataset, and the lower
gastrointestinal (colonoscopy) videos were drawn from the HyperKvasir dataset.
The CNN architecture used was ResNet-50. This study demonstrates an
interpretable and reproducible diagnostic pipeline that unifies multiple
diagnostic modalities to advance and ease the detection of colorectal diseases.

Abstract: Drought stress is a major threat to global crop productivity, making its
early and precise detection essential for sustainable agricultural management.
Traditional approaches, though useful, are often time-consuming and
labor-intensive, which has motivated the adoption of deep learning methods. In
recent years, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer
architectures have been widely explored for drought stress identification;
however, these models generally rely on a large number of trainable parameters,
restricting their use in resource-limited and real-time agricultural settings.
To address this challenge, we propose a novel lightweight hybrid CNN framework
inspired by ResNet, DenseNet, and MobileNet architectures. The framework
achieves a remarkable 15-fold reduction in trainable parameters compared to
conventional CNN and Vision Transformer models, while maintaining competitive
accuracy. In addition, we introduce a machine unlearning mechanism based on a
gradient norm-based influence function, which enables targeted removal of
specific training data influence, thereby improving model adaptability. The
method was evaluated on an aerial image dataset of potato fields with
expert-annotated healthy and drought-stressed regions. Experimental results
show that our framework achieves high accuracy while substantially lowering
computational costs. These findings highlight its potential as a practical,
scalable, and adaptive solution for drought stress monitoring in precision
agriculture, particularly under resource-constrained conditions.

lightweight, scale-adaptive feature extraction and upsampling, incorporating
the Simple parameter-free Attention Module (SimAM) for efficient guidance and
gradient variance loss to enhance sharpness in image details. Our method
integrates seamlessly into multiple state-of-the-art SR backbones (e.g., SCNet,
HiT-SR, OverNet), delivering competitive or superior performance across a wide
range of integer and non-integer scale factors. Extensive experiments on
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach enables robust multi-scale
upscaling with minimal computational overhead, offering a practical solution
for real-world scenarios.

treatment in longitudinal imaging is being studied, to better understand growth
trajectories and ultimately predict treatment success or toxicity as early as
possible. In this study, we implement an automated pipeline to curate a large
longitudinal dataset of SRS treatment data, resulting in a cohort of 896 BMs in
177 patients who were monitored for >360 days at approximately two-month
intervals at Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV). We use a data-driven
clustering to identify characteristic trajectories. In addition, we predict 12
months lesion-level response using classical as well as graph machine learning
Graph Machine Learning (GML). Clustering revealed 5 dominant growth
trajectories with distinct final response categories. Response prediction
reaches up to 0.90 AUC (CI95%=0.88-0.92) using only pre-treatment and first
follow-up MRI with gradient boosting. Similarly, robust predictive performance
of up to 0.88 AUC (CI95%=0.86-0.90) was obtained using GML, offering more
flexibility with a single model for multiple input time-points configurations.
Our results suggest potential automation and increased precision for the
comprehensive assessment and prediction of BM response to SRS in longitudinal
MRI. The proposed pipeline facilitates scalable data curation for the
investigation of BM growth patterns, and lays the foundation for clinical
decision support systems aiming at optimizing personalized care.

TL;DR: 3D高斯泼溅在有限视角区域重建大场景时存在坐标量化问题，提出基于球坐标的新量化方案来改善投影误差


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS在大场景重建中，输入视角来自有限空间区域，当相机位置只有小范围偏移时（3DoF+），传统坐标量化方法会导致投影误差随距离平方反比增大

Method: 分析位置误差对像素投影误差的影响，提出基于球坐标的新型量化方案，在球坐标系下进行更有效的坐标表示

Result: 在Garden场景上展示了提出的方法在率失真性能方面的改进效果

Conclusion: 针对3DoF+场景的特定需求，球坐标量化方案能有效降低投影误差，提升3DGS在有限视角区域的重建质量

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a major breakthrough in 3D scene
reconstruction. With a number of views of a given object or scene, the
algorithm trains a model composed of 3D gaussians, which enables the production
of novel views from arbitrary points of view. This freedom of movement is
referred to as 6DoF for 6 degrees of freedom: a view is produced for any
position (3 degrees), orientation of camera (3 other degrees). On large scenes,
though, the input views are acquired from a limited zone in space, and the
reconstruction is valuable for novel views from the same zone, even if the
scene itself is almost unlimited in size. We refer to this particular case as
3DoF+, meaning that the 3 degrees of freedom of camera position are limited to
small offsets around the central position. Considering the problem of
coordinate quantization, the impact of position error on the projection error
in pixels is studied. It is shown that the projection error is proportional to
the squared inverse distance of the point being projected. Consequently, a new
quantization scheme based on spherical coordinates is proposed. Rate-distortion
performance of the proposed method are illustrated on the well-known Garden
scene.

Abstract: Recent progress in vision-language models (VLMs) has led to impressive
results in document understanding tasks, but their high computational demands
remain a challenge. To mitigate the compute burdens, we propose a lightweight
token pruning framework that filters out non-informative background regions
from document images prior to VLM processing. A binary patch-level classifier
removes non-text areas, and a max-pooling refinement step recovers fragmented
text regions to enhance spatial coherence. Experiments on real-world document
datasets demonstrate that our approach substantially lowers computational
costs, while maintaining comparable accuracy.

TL;DR: Phantom-Insight是一种基于SAM和MLLM的视频伪装目标检测新方法，通过动态前景视觉标记评分模块和解耦学习策略，解决了现有方法在边缘分离和目标-背景分离方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VCOD方法面临两个主要问题：(1)SAM方法因模型冻结而难以分离伪装目标边缘；(2)MLLM方法因大语言模型合并前景和背景而导致目标分离性差。

Method: 提出基于SAM和MLLM的Phantom-Insight方法：1)使用时序和空间线索表示视频序列，通过LLM进行特征融合；2)通过动态前景视觉标记评分模块和提示网络生成多线索，自适应指导SAM模型；3)提出解耦前景-背景学习策略，分别生成前景和背景线索进行解耦训练。

Conclusion: Phantom-Insight通过结合SAM和MLLM的优势，并引入创新的解耦学习策略，有效解决了视频伪装目标检测中的边缘分离和目标-背景分离问题，具有优异的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Video camouflaged object detection (VCOD) is challenging due to dynamic
environments. Existing methods face two main issues: (1) SAM-based methods
struggle to separate camouflaged object edges due to model freezing, and (2)
MLLM-based methods suffer from poor object separability as large language
models merge foreground and background. To address these issues, we propose a
novel VCOD method based on SAM and MLLM, called Phantom-Insight. To enhance the
separability of object edge details, we represent video sequences with temporal
and spatial clues and perform feature fusion via LLM to increase information
density. Next, multiple cues are generated through the dynamic foreground
visual token scoring module and the prompt network to adaptively guide and
fine-tune the SAM model, enabling it to adapt to subtle textures. To enhance
the separability of objects and background, we propose a decoupled
foreground-background learning strategy. By generating foreground and
background cues separately and performing decoupled training, the visual token
can effectively integrate foreground and background information independently,
enabling SAM to more accurately segment camouflaged objects in the video.
Experiments on the MoCA-Mask dataset show that Phantom-Insight achieves
state-of-the-art performance across various metrics. Additionally, its ability
to detect unseen camouflaged objects on the CAD2016 dataset highlights its
strong generalization ability.

Conclusion: 这是首个面向实际应用的零标注牛鼻检测解决方案，为畜牧业监测提供了更灵活、易部署的替代方案

Abstract: Muzzle patterns are among the most effective biometric traits for cattle
identification. Fast and accurate detection of the muzzle region as the region
of interest is critical to automatic visual cattle identification.. Earlier
approaches relied on manual detection, which is labor-intensive and
inconsistent. Recently, automated methods using supervised models like YOLO
have become popular for muzzle detection. Although effective, these methods
require extensive annotated datasets and tend to be trained data-dependent,
limiting their performance on new or unseen cattle. To address these
limitations, this study proposes a zero-shot muzzle detection framework based
on Grounding DINO, a vision-language model capable of detecting muzzles without
any task-specific training or annotated data. This approach leverages natural
language prompts to guide detection, enabling scalable and flexible muzzle
localization across diverse breeds and environments. Our model achieves a mean
Average Precision (mAP)@0.5 of 76.8\%, demonstrating promising performance
without requiring annotated data. To our knowledge, this is the first research
to provide a real-world, industry-oriented, and annotation-free solution for
cattle muzzle detection. The framework offers a practical alternative to
supervised methods, promising improved adaptability and ease of deployment in
livestock monitoring applications.

Abstract: Cross-source point cloud registration, which aims to align point cloud data
from different sensors, is a fundamental task in 3D vision. However, compared
to the same-source point cloud registration, cross-source registration faces
two core challenges: the lack of publicly available large-scale real-world
datasets for training the deep registration models, and the inherent
differences in point clouds captured by multiple sensors. The diverse patterns
induced by the sensors pose great challenges in robust and accurate point cloud
feature extraction and matching, which negatively influence the registration
accuracy. To advance research in this field, we construct Cross3DReg, the
currently largest and real-world multi-modal cross-source point cloud
registration dataset, which is collected by a rotating mechanical lidar and a
hybrid semi-solid-state lidar, respectively. Moreover, we design an
overlap-based cross-source registration framework, which utilizes unaligned
images to predict the overlapping region between source and target point
clouds, effectively filtering out redundant points in the irrelevant regions
and significantly mitigating the interference caused by noise in
non-overlapping areas. Then, a visual-geometric attention guided matching
module is proposed to enhance the consistency of cross-source point cloud
features by fusing image and geometric information to establish reliable
correspondences and ultimately achieve accurate and robust registration.
Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
registration performance. Our framework reduces the relative rotation error
(RRE) and relative translation error (RTE) by $63.2\%$ and $40.2\%$,
respectively, and improves the registration recall (RR) by $5.4\%$, which
validates its effectiveness in achieving accurate cross-source registration.

Abstract: Deep neural networks currently dominate many fields of the artificial
intelligence landscape, achieving state-of-the-art results on numerous tasks
while remaining hard to understand and exhibiting surprising weaknesses. An
active area of research focuses on adversarial attacks, which aim to generate
inputs that uncover these weaknesses. However, this proves challenging,
especially in the black-box scenario where model details are inaccessible. This
paper explores in detail the impact of such adversarial algorithms on
ResNet-18, DenseNet-121, Swin Transformer V2, and Vision Transformer network
architectures. Leveraging the Tiny ImageNet, Caltech-256, and Food-101
datasets, we benchmark two novel black-box iterative adversarial algorithms
based on affine transformations and genetic algorithms: 1) Affine
Transformation Attack (ATA), an iterative algorithm maximizing our attack score
function using random affine transformations, and 2) Affine Genetic Attack
(AGA), a genetic algorithm that involves random noise and affine
transformations. We evaluate the performance of the models in the algorithm
parameter variation, data augmentation, and global and targeted attack
configurations. We also compare our algorithms with two black-box adversarial
algorithms, Pixle and Square Attack. Our experiments yield better results on
the image classification task than similar methods in the literature, achieving
an accuracy improvement of up to 8.82%. We provide noteworthy insights into
successful adversarial defenses and attacks at both global and targeted levels,
and demonstrate adversarial robustness through algorithm parameter variation.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了视觉复杂度与注意力机制的相互作用，为通过对比注意力改进视觉推理提供了有效途径

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across
diverse visual tasks, yet their performance degrades in complex visual
environments. While existing enhancement approaches require additional
training, rely on external segmentation tools, or operate at coarse-grained
levels, they overlook the innate ability within VLMs. To bridge this gap, we
investigate VLMs' attention patterns and discover that: (1) visual complexity
strongly correlates with attention entropy, negatively impacting reasoning
performance; (2) attention progressively refines from global scanning in
shallow layers to focused convergence in deeper layers, with convergence degree
determined by visual complexity. (3) Theoretically, we prove that the contrast
of attention maps between general queries and task-specific queries enables the
decomposition of visual signal into semantic signals and visual noise
components. Building on these insights, we propose Contrastive Attention
Refinement for Visual Enhancement (CARVE), a training-free method that extracts
task-relevant visual signals through attention contrasting at the pixel level.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CARVE consistently enhances performance,
achieving up to 75% improvement on open-source models. Our work provides
critical insights into the interplay between visual complexity and attention
mechanisms, offering an efficient pathway for improving visual reasoning with
contrasting attention.

Abstract: Realistic and parameterized 3D models of human anatomy have become invaluable
in research, diagnostics, and surgical planning. However, the development of
detailed models for internal organs, such as the stomach, has been limited by
data availability and methodological challenges. In this paper, we propose a
novel pipeline for the generation of synthetic 3D stomach models, enabling the
creation of anatomically diverse morphologies informed by established studies
on stomach shape variability. Using this pipeline, we construct a dataset of
synthetic stomachs. Building on this dataset, we develop a 3D statistical shape
model of the stomach, trained to capture natural anatomical variability in a
low-dimensional shape space. The model is further refined using CT meshes
derived from publicly available datasets through a semi-supervised alignment
process, enhancing its ability to generalize to unseen anatomical variations.
We evaluated the model on a held-out test set of real stomach CT scans,
demonstrating robust generalization and fit accuracy. We make the statistical
shape model along with the synthetic dataset publicly available on GitLab:
https://gitlab.com/Erez.Posner/stomach_pytorch to facilitate further research.
This work introduces the first statistical 3D shape model of the stomach, with
applications ranging from surgical simulation and pre-operative planning to
medical education and computational modeling. By combining synthetic data
generation, parametric modeling, and real-world validation, our approach
represents a significant advancement in organ modeling and opens new
possibilities for personalized healthcare solutions.

Abstract: The advent of large-scale vision foundation models, pre-trained on diverse
natural images, has marked a paradigm shift in computer vision. However, how
the frontier vision foundation models' efficacies transfer to specialized
domains remains such as medical imaging remains an open question. This report
investigates whether DINOv3, a state-of-the-art self-supervised vision
transformer (ViT) that features strong capability in dense prediction tasks,
can directly serve as a powerful, unified encoder for medical vision tasks
without domain-specific pre-training. To answer this, we benchmark DINOv3
across common medical vision tasks, including 2D/3D classification and
segmentation on a wide range of medical imaging modalities. We systematically
analyze its scalability by varying model sizes and input image resolutions. Our
findings reveal that DINOv3 shows impressive performance and establishes a
formidable new baseline. Remarkably, it can even outperform medical-specific
foundation models like BiomedCLIP and CT-Net on several tasks, despite being
trained solely on natural images. However, we identify clear limitations: The
model's features degrade in scenarios requiring deep domain specialization,
such as in Whole-Slide Pathological Images (WSIs), Electron Microscopy (EM),
and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Furthermore, we observe that DINOv3
does not consistently obey scaling law in the medical domain; performance does
not reliably increase with larger models or finer feature resolutions, showing
diverse scaling behaviors across tasks. Ultimately, our work establishes DINOv3
as a strong baseline, whose powerful visual features can serve as a robust
prior for multiple complex medical tasks. This opens promising future
directions, such as leveraging its features to enforce multiview consistency in
3D reconstruction.

TL;DR: FSG-Net是一个频率-空间协同门控网络，通过频域分析和空间增强来解决高分辨率遥感图像变化检测中的伪变化和语义鸿沟问题，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率遥感图像变化检测面临两个关键挑战：一是模型容易将时间偏移（如光照、季节变化）引起的辐射变化误判为真实变化，导致大量误报；二是深层抽象特征与浅层细节丰富特征之间存在语义鸿沟，阻碍有效融合，导致边界模糊。

Conclusion: FSG-Net通过频域和空间域的协同处理，有效解决了变化检测中的伪变化和特征融合问题，在多个标准数据集上表现出优越性能，为遥感图像变化检测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Change detection from high-resolution remote sensing images lies as a
cornerstone of Earth observation applications, yet its efficacy is often
compromised by two critical challenges. First, false alarms are prevalent as
models misinterpret radiometric variations from temporal shifts (e.g.,
illumination, season) as genuine changes. Second, a non-negligible semantic gap
between deep abstract features and shallow detail-rich features tends to
obstruct their effective fusion, culminating in poorly delineated boundaries.
To step further in addressing these issues, we propose the Frequency-Spatial
Synergistic Gated Network (FSG-Net), a novel paradigm that aims to
systematically disentangle semantic changes from nuisance variations.
Specifically, FSG-Net first operates in the frequency domain, where a
Discrepancy-Aware Wavelet Interaction Module (DAWIM) adaptively mitigates
pseudo-changes by discerningly processing different frequency components.
Subsequently, the refined features are enhanced in the spatial domain by a
Synergistic Temporal-Spatial Attention Module (STSAM), which amplifies the
saliency of genuine change regions. To finally bridge the semantic gap, a
Lightweight Gated Fusion Unit (LGFU) leverages high-level semantics to
selectively gate and integrate crucial details from shallow layers.
Comprehensive experiments on the CDD, GZ-CD, and LEVIR-CD benchmarks validate
the superiority of FSG-Net, establishing a new state-of-the-art with F1-scores
of 94.16%, 89.51%, and 91.27%, respectively. The code will be made available at
https://github.com/zxXie-Air/FSG-Net after a possible publication.

Abstract: In industrial quality control, to visually recognize unwanted items within a
moving heterogeneous stream, human operators are often still indispensable.
Waste-sorting stands as a significant example, where operators on multiple
conveyor belts manually remove unwanted objects to select specific materials.
To automate this recognition problem, computer vision systems offer great
potential in accurately identifying and segmenting unwanted items in such
settings. Unfortunately, considering the multitude and the variety of sorting
tasks, fully supervised approaches are not a viable option to address this
challange, as they require extensive labeling efforts. Surprisingly, weakly
supervised alternatives that leverage the implicit supervision naturally
provided by the operator in his removal action are relatively unexplored. In
this paper, we define the concept of Before-After Supervision, illustrating how
to train a segmentation network by leveraging only the visual differences
between images acquired \textit{before} and \textit{after} the operator. To
promote research in this direction, we introduce WS$^2$ (Weakly Supervised
segmentation for Waste-Sorting), the first multiview dataset consisting of more
than 11 000 high-resolution video frames captured on top of a conveyor belt,
including "before" and "after" images. We also present a robust end-to-end
pipeline, used to benchmark several state-of-the-art weakly supervised
segmentation methods on WS$^2$.

Abstract: Subject-driven image generation (SDIG) aims to manipulate specific subjects
within images while adhering to textual instructions, a task crucial for
advancing text-to-image diffusion models. SDIG requires reconciling the tension
between maintaining subject identity and complying with dynamic edit
instructions, a challenge inadequately addressed by existing methods. In this
paper, we introduce the Target-Instructed Diffusion Enhancing (TIDE) framework,
which resolves this tension through target supervision and preference learning
without test-time fine-tuning. TIDE pioneers target-supervised triplet
alignment, modelling subject adaptation dynamics using a (reference image,
instruction, target images) triplet. This approach leverages the Direct Subject
Diffusion (DSD) objective, training the model with paired "winning" (balanced
preservation-compliance) and "losing" (distorted) targets, systematically
generated and evaluated via quantitative metrics. This enables implicit reward
modelling for optimal preservation-compliance balance. Experimental results on
standard benchmarks demonstrate TIDE's superior performance in generating
subject-faithful outputs while maintaining instruction compliance,

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种自动化的混合框架，结合深度学习特征提取和广泛的政学特征，用于从纵向MRI扫描中分类脑细胞瘤对治疗的响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然RANO标准提供了脑部肛瘤疗效评估框架，但其应用复杂且存在观察者变异性，需要自动化方法来提高评估的准确性和可靠性。

Method: 提出一种新的混合框架，结合了细调的ResNet-18模型提取的2D区域特征和4800个政学及临床特征，包括3D瘤瘤增长/缩小掩码、体积变化和瘤体质心偏移等。使用CatBoost分类器进行四类响应预测。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，将学习到的图像表征与领域目标政学特征相结合，为脑部肛瘤自动化疗效评估提供了稳健而有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate evaluation of the response of glioblastoma to therapy is crucial for
clinical decision-making and patient management. The Response Assessment in
Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria provide a standardized framework to assess
patients' clinical response, but their application can be complex and subject
to observer variability. This paper presents an automated method for
classifying the intervention response from longitudinal MRI scans, developed to
predict tumor response during therapy as part of the BraTS 2025 challenge. We
propose a novel hybrid framework that combines deep learning derived feature
extraction and an extensive set of radiomics and clinically chosen features.
Our approach utilizes a fine-tuned ResNet-18 model to extract features from 2D
regions of interest across four MRI modalities. These deep features are then
fused with a rich set of more than 4800 radiomic and clinically driven
features, including 3D radiomics of tumor growth and shrinkage masks,
volumetric changes relative to the nadir, and tumor centroid shift. Using the
fused feature set, a CatBoost classifier achieves a mean ROC AUC of 0.81 and a
Macro F1 score of 0.50 in the 4-class response prediction task (Complete
Response, Partial Response, Stable Disease, Progressive Disease). Our results
highlight that synergizing learned image representations with domain-targeted
radiomic features provides a robust and effective solution for automated
treatment response assessment in neuro-oncology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究重现了FairCLIP方法，发现原始实现与描述不一致，提出了A-FairCLIP和FairCLIP+改进方法，但实验结果并不支持FairCLIP能提升CLIP的性能和公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检验Luo等人(2024)提出的FairCLIP方法的可重现性，调查其通过Sinkhorn距离减少敏感组间图像-文本相似性差异来改善CLIP公平性的方法是否有效。

Method: 重现Luo等人的实验设置，发现原始实现问题后提出A-FairCLIP新实现，并扩展出支持多属性的FairCLIP+方法，在Harvard-FairVLMed数据集上进行零检出青光眼分类实验。

Result: 证实CLIP存在人口统计学偏见，但FairCLIP的正式和对齐实现均未能提升性能或公平性，虽然Sinkhorn距离有所减小。

Conclusion: 虽然FairCLIP的正则化目标能减小距离差异，但实验结果并不支持其能够改善CLIP的公平性和性能表现。

Abstract: We investigated the reproducibility of FairCLIP, proposed by Luo et al.
(2024), for improving the group fairness of CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) by
minimizing image-text similarity score disparities across sensitive groups
using the Sinkhorn distance. The experimental setup of Luo et al. (2024) was
reproduced to primarily investigate the research findings for FairCLIP. The
model description by Luo et al. (2024) was found to differ from the original
implementation. Therefore, a new implementation, A-FairCLIP, is introduced to
examine specific design choices. Furthermore, FairCLIP+ is proposed to extend
the FairCLIP objective to include multiple attributes. Additionally, the impact
of the distance minimization on FairCLIP's fairness and performance was
explored. In alignment with the original authors, CLIP was found to be biased
towards certain demographics when applied to zero-shot glaucoma classification
using medical scans and clinical notes from the Harvard-FairVLMed dataset.
However, the experimental results on two datasets do not support their claim
that FairCLIP improves the performance and fairness of CLIP. Although the
regularization objective reduces Sinkhorn distances, both the official
implementation and the aligned implementation, A-FairCLIP, were not found to
improve performance nor fairness in zero-shot glaucoma classification.

Method: 开发了FMOX JSON格式来扩展FMO数据集的真值信息，包含物体尺寸数据，并使用轨迹交并比(TIoU)指标评估EfficientTAM模型性能。

Result: EfficientTAM基础模型在FMOX数据集上的性能表现与专门为FMO设计的传统流水线相当。

Conclusion: FMOX格式为FMO跟踪研究提供了可访问的标准数据集格式，支持其他机器学习流水线的使用，代码和JSON数据已开源。

Abstract: Fast and tiny object tracking remains a challenge in computer vision and in
this paper we first introduce a JSON metadata file associated with four open
source datasets of Fast Moving Objects (FMOs) image sequences. In addition, we
extend the description of the FMOs datasets with additional ground truth
information in JSON format (called FMOX) with object size information. Finally
we use our FMOX file to test a recently proposed foundational model for
tracking (called EfficientTAM) showing that its performance compares well with
the pipelines originally taylored for these FMO datasets. Our comparison of
these state-of-the-art techniques on FMOX is provided with Trajectory
Intersection of Union (TIoU) scores. The code and JSON is shared open source
allowing FMOX to be accessible and usable for other machine learning pipelines
aiming to process FMO datasets.

<details>

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注检索模型的架构增强，而忽视了真实世界草图中固有的模糊性和噪声问题。

Method: 设计了一个专门针对草图变异性具有鲁棒性的训练目标，结合适当的预训练策略、编码器架构和损失函数公式。

Result: 在具有挑战性的FS-COCO和广泛使用的SketchyCOCO数据集上进行了大量实验，证实了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 强调了训练设计在跨模态检索任务中的关键作用，并指出需要改进场景级草图检索的评估场景。

Abstract: The goal of Scene-level Sketch-Based Image Retrieval is to retrieve natural
images matching the overall semantics and spatial layout of a free-hand sketch.
Unlike prior work focused on architectural augmentations of retrieval models,
we emphasize the inherent ambiguity and noise present in real-world sketches.
This insight motivates a training objective that is explicitly designed to be
robust to sketch variability. We show that with an appropriate combination of
pre-training, encoder architecture, and loss formulation, it is possible to
achieve state-of-the-art performance without the introduction of additional
complexity. Extensive experiments on a challenging FS-COCO and widely-used
SketchyCOCO datasets confirm the effectiveness of our approach and underline
the critical role of training design in cross-modal retrieval tasks, as well as
the need to improve the evaluation scenarios of scene-level SBIR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开集识别方法主要面向静态场景，无法满足从连续数据流中增量识别新未知类别的需求，导致类间混淆问题。

Method: 提出保持性角度表征学习(RARL)：1)在均角紧架构造的角度空间中对齐未知表征到非活跃原型；2)采用虚拟-内在交互(VII)训练策略，通过边界近旁虚拟类增强类间边界；3)分层校正策略精炼决策边界。

Result: 在CIFAR100和TinyImageNet数据集上进行了全面评估，建立了IOSR新的基准，在各种任务设置下都达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: RARL方法能够有效缓解增量开集识别中的表征偏移和特征空间扭曲问题，通过角度空间表征学习和虚拟类交互训练，显著提升了模型的识别性能力。

Abstract: Existing open set recognition (OSR) methods are typically designed for static
scenarios, where models aim to classify known classes and identify unknown ones
within fixed scopes. This deviates from the expectation that the model should
incrementally identify newly emerging unknown classes from continuous data
streams and acquire corresponding knowledge. In such evolving scenarios, the
discriminability of OSR decision boundaries is hard to maintain due to
restricted access to former training data, causing severe inter-class
confusion. To solve this problem, we propose retentive angular representation
learning (RARL) for incremental open set recognition (IOSR). In RARL, unknown
representations are encouraged to align around inactive prototypes within an
angular space constructed under the equiangular tight frame, thereby mitigating
excessive representation drift during knowledge updates. Specifically, we adopt
a virtual-intrinsic interactive (VII) training strategy, which compacts known
representations by enforcing clear inter-class margins through
boundary-proximal virtual classes. Furthermore, a stratified rectification
strategy is designed to refine decision boundaries, mitigating representation
bias and feature space distortion caused by imbalances between old/new and
positive/negative class samples. We conduct thorough evaluations on CIFAR100
and TinyImageNet datasets and establish a new benchmark for IOSR. Experimental
results across various task setups demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Method: 采用机器学习方法学习一个近似Condorcet排序的简化排序，Condorcet排序基于投票问题思想，通过多个不同排序的投票结果来对元素进行排序

Result: 初步计算实验证实了学习简化映射的有效性，能够成功定义彩色图像的向量值形态学算子

Conclusion: 该方法为解决向量值图像数学形态学处理中的排序问题提供了一种有效的机器学习解决方案

Abstract: Mathematical morphology provides a nonlinear framework for image and spatial
data processing and analysis. Although there have been many successful
applications of mathematical morphology to vector-valued images, such as color
and hyperspectral images, there is still no consensus on the most suitable
vector ordering for constructing morphological operators. This paper addresses
this issue by examining a reduced ordering approximating the Condorcet ranking
derived from a set of vector orderings. Inspired by voting problems, the
Condorcet ordering ranks elements from most to least voted, with voters
representing different orderings. In this paper, we develop a machine learning
approach that learns a reduced ordering that approximates the Condorcet
ordering. Preliminary computational experiments confirm the effectiveness of
learning the reduced mapping to define vector-valued morphological operators
for color images.

TL;DR: CausNVS是一个自回归的多视角扩散模型，支持任意输入输出视角配置，通过顺序生成视图来解决现有非自回归方法的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多视角扩散模型大多采用非自回归形式，限制了在3D新视角合成中的应用，因为它们只支持固定数量的视图，并且由于同时去噪所有帧而导致推理速度慢。

Method: 使用因果掩码和逐帧噪声训练，采用成对相对相机姿态编码(CaPE)实现精确相机控制。推理时结合空间感知滑动窗口、键值缓存和噪声条件增强来减轻漂移。

Result: 实验表明CausNVS支持广泛的相机轨迹，能够实现灵活的自回归新视角合成，并在不同设置下保持一致的强视觉质量。

Conclusion: CausNVS通过自回归方法成功解决了多视角扩散模型在视角配置灵活性和推理效率方面的限制，为3D新视角合成提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-view diffusion models have shown promise in 3D novel view synthesis,
but most existing methods adopt a non-autoregressive formulation. This limits
their applicability in world modeling, as they only support a fixed number of
views and suffer from slow inference due to denoising all frames
simultaneously. To address these limitations, we propose CausNVS, a multi-view
diffusion model in an autoregressive setting, which supports arbitrary
input-output view configurations and generates views sequentially. We train
CausNVS with causal masking and per-frame noise, using pairwise-relative camera
pose encodings (CaPE) for precise camera control. At inference time, we combine
a spatially-aware sliding-window with key-value caching and noise conditioning
augmentation to mitigate drift. Our experiments demonstrate that CausNVS
supports a broad range of camera trajectories, enables flexible autoregressive
novel view synthesis, and achieves consistently strong visual quality across
diverse settings. Project page: https://kxhit.github.io/CausNVS.html.

Abstract: Unsustainable trade in wildlife is a major threat to biodiversity and is now
increasingly prevalent in digital marketplaces and social media. With the sheer
volume of digital content, the need for automated methods to detect wildlife
trade listings is growing. These methods are especially needed for the
automatic identification of wildlife products, such as ivory. We developed
machine learning-based object recognition models that can identify wildlife
products within images and highlight them. The data consists of images of
elephant, pangolin, and tiger products that were identified as being sold
illegally or that were confiscated by authorities. Specifically, the wildlife
products included elephant ivory and skins, pangolin scales, and claws (raw and
crafted), and tiger skins and bones. We investigated various combinations of
training strategies and two loss functions to identify the best model to use in
the automatic detection of these wildlife products. Models were trained for
each species while also developing a single model to identify products from all
three species. The best model showed an overall accuracy of 84.2% with
accuracies of 71.1%, 90.2% and 93.5% in detecting products derived from
elephants, pangolins, and tigers, respectively. We further demonstrate that the
machine learning model can be made easily available to stakeholders, such as
government authorities and law enforcement agencies, by developing a
smartphone-based application that had an overall accuracy of 91.3%. The
application can be used in real time to click images and help identify
potentially prohibited products of target species. Thus, the proposed method is
not only applicable for monitoring trade on the web but can also be used e.g.
in physical markets for monitoring wildlife trade.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的混合Swin注意力网络(HSANet)，用于低尿量CT和PET图像去噪，在保持轻量级模型的同时实现了更优的去噪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低尿量CT和PET虽然减少了放射风险，但会导致图像噪声和伪影增加，影响诊断准确性。需要去噪技术来提高图像质量保持放射安全。

Method: 设计了混合Swin注意力网络(HSANet)，包含高效全局注意力(EGA)模块和混合上采样模块。EGA模块增强空间和通道维度的相互作用，混合上采样模块减少对噪声的过拟合。

Result: 在公开的LDCT/PET数据集上验证，HSANet在去噪性能上超过现有方法，同时保持轻量级模型大小，适合在标准内存配置的GPU上部署。

Conclusion: 该方法为临床应用提供了高度实用的解决方案，能在保持轻量模型的前提下实现优异的去噪效果。

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) and positron emission tomography (PET)
have emerged as safer alternatives to conventional imaging modalities by
significantly reducing radiation exposure. However, this reduction often
results in increased noise and artifacts, which can compromise diagnostic
accuracy. Consequently, denoising for LDCT/PET has become a vital area of
research aimed at enhancing image quality while maintaining radiation safety.
In this study, we introduce a novel Hybrid Swin Attention Network (HSANet),
which incorporates Efficient Global Attention (EGA) modules and a hybrid
upsampling module. The EGA modules enhance both spatial and channel-wise
interaction, improving the network's capacity to capture relevant features,
while the hybrid upsampling module mitigates the risk of overfitting to noise.
We validate the proposed approach using a publicly available LDCT/PET dataset.
Experimental results demonstrate that HSANet achieves superior denoising
performance compared to existing methods, while maintaining a lightweight model
size suitable for deployment on GPUs with standard memory configurations. This
makes our approach highly practical for real-world clinical applications.

Result: CNN-LSTM模型达到98%的高准确率，显著超过仅空间CNN模型的80.45%和其他机器学习方法的76%

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效捕捉氮素缺乏、水分压力和杂草压力之间的复杂交互作用，为及旹预防急急识别氮素迫缩提供了强大工具，有助于改善作物管理和植物健康

Abstract: Plants in their natural habitats endure an array of interacting stresses,
both biotic and abiotic, that rarely occur in isolation. Nutrient
stress-particularly nitrogen deficiency-becomes even more critical when
compounded with drought and weed competition, making it increasingly difficult
to distinguish and address its effects. Early detection of nitrogen stress is
therefore crucial for protecting plant health and implementing effective
management strategies. This study proposes a novel deep learning framework to
accurately classify nitrogen stress severity in a combined stress environment.
Our model uses a unique blend of four imaging modalities-RGB, multispectral,
and two infrared wavelengths-to capture a wide range of physiological plant
responses from canopy images. These images, provided as time-series data,
document plant health across three levels of nitrogen availability (low,
medium, and high) under varying water stress and weed pressures. The core of
our approach is a spatio-temporal deep learning pipeline that merges a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for extracting spatial features from images
with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture temporal dependencies.
We also devised and evaluated a spatial-only CNN pipeline for comparison. Our
CNN-LSTM pipeline achieved an impressive accuracy of 98%, impressively
surpassing the spatial-only model's 80.45% and other previously reported
machine learning method's 76%. These results bring actionable insights based on
the power of our CNN-LSTM approach in effectively capturing the subtle and
complex interactions between nitrogen deficiency, water stress, and weed
pressure. This robust platform offers a promising tool for the timely and
proactive identification of nitrogen stress severity, enabling better crop
management and improved plant health.

Motivation: 通过高速量解释机器人收集的海底视觉图像可以提高海洋监测和探索的效率。虽然最近的研究已经建议位置元数据可以增强自监督学习，但其在不同的SSL策略、模型和海底图像数据集中的好处尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 评估位置基于正则化对六种最新SSL框架的影响，包括不同隐藏空间维度的卷积神经网络(CNN)和视觉Transformer(ViT)模型。在三个多样的海底图像数据集上进行评估。

Result: 位置正则化持续提升了下游分类性能：CNN模型获得4.9±4.0%的F1分数提升，ViT模型获得6.3±8.9%的提升。位置正则化的SSL在低维隐藏表征下对CNN的改善效果更为显著，而高维ViT模型显示出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了位置元数据对SSL正则化的价值，尤其是在使用低维隐藏表征时，并证明了高维ViT模型在海底图像分析中的强大泛化能力。

Abstract: High-throughput interpretation of robotically gathered seafloor visual
imagery can increase the efficiency of marine monitoring and exploration.
Although recent research has suggested that location metadata can enhance
self-supervised feature learning (SSL), its benefits across different SSL
strategies, models and seafloor image datasets are underexplored. This study
evaluates the impact of location-based regularisation on six state-of-the-art
SSL frameworks, which include Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision
Transformer (ViT) models with varying latent-space dimensionality. Evaluation
across three diverse seafloor image datasets finds that location-regularisation
consistently improves downstream classification performance over standard SSL,
with average F1-score gains of $4.9 \pm 4.0%$ for CNNs and $6.3 \pm 8.9%$ for
ViTs, respectively. While CNNs pretrained on generic datasets benefit from
high-dimensional latent representations, dataset-optimised SSL achieves similar
performance across the high (512) and low (128) dimensional latent
representations. Location-regularised SSL improves CNN performance over
pre-trained models by $2.7 \pm 2.7%$ and $10.1 \pm 9.4%$ for high and
low-dimensional latent representations, respectively. For ViTs,
high-dimensionality benefits both pre-trained and dataset-optimised SSL.
Although location-regularisation improves SSL performance compared to standard
SSL methods, pre-trained ViTs show strong generalisation, matching the
best-performing location-regularised SSL with F1-scores of $0.795 \pm 0.075$
and $0.795 \pm 0.077$, respectively. The findings highlight the value of
location metadata for SSL regularisation, particularly when using
low-dimensional latent representations, and demonstrate strong generalisation
of high-dimensional ViTs for seafloor image analysis.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种无监督的在线聚类框架(OCF)，用于实时解释海底图像，支持长期自主海洋探索任务的适应性和通信优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着长耐耕和海底居留AUV的能力提升，需要实时解释海底图像来支持适应性任务和优化通信效率。现有的离线图像分析方法需要完整数据集和人工标注，无法满足实时场景的需求。

Method: 设计了一种在线聚类框架(OCF)，能够在无监督情况下处理连续数据流。该方法通过识别和维护一组代表性样本来捐捕演化的特征分布，支持动态聚类合并和分割，无需重新处理全部图像历史。

Result: 在三个多样化海底图像数据集上评估，OCF在所有比较性在线聚类方法中获得最高平均F1分数(0.68)，标准偏差为3%，显示了其优秀的聚类能力和对调查轨迹变化的稳健性。同时保持了较低且有界的计算时间。

Conclusion: OCF框架具有较强的聚类能力和稳健性，适合用于生成调查数据摘要和支持长期持续自主海洋探索中的信息化路径规划。

Abstract: As long-endurance and seafloor-resident AUVs become more capable, there is an
increasing need for extended, real-time interpretation of seafloor imagery to
enable adaptive missions and optimise communication efficiency. Although
offline image analysis methods are well established, they rely on access to
complete datasets and human-labelled examples to manage the strong influence of
environmental and operational conditions on seafloor image
appearance-requirements that cannot be met in real-time settings. To address
this, we introduce an online clustering framework (OCF) capable of interpreting
seafloor imagery without supervision, which is designed to operate in real-time
on continuous data streams in a scalable, adaptive, and self-consistent manner.
The method enables the efficient review and consolidation of common patterns
across the entire data history in constant time by identifying and maintaining
a set of representative samples that capture the evolving feature distribution,
supporting dynamic cluster merging and splitting without reprocessing the full
image history. We evaluate the framework on three diverse seafloor image
datasets, analysing the impact of different representative sampling strategies
on both clustering accuracy and computational cost. The OCF achieves the
highest average F1 score of 0.68 across the three datasets among all
comparative online clustering approaches, with a standard deviation of 3%
across three distinct survey trajectories, demonstrating its superior
clustering capability and robustness to trajectory variation. In addition, it
maintains consistently lower and bounded computational time as the data volume
increases. These properties are beneficial for generating survey data summaries
and supporting informative path planning in long-term, persistent autonomous
marine exploration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统高斯泼溅方法需要准确的深度信息（RGB-D/立体相机），但深度感知范围有限，难以处理大场景。单目图像缺乏深度指导，导致新视角合成效果不佳。现有的大基础模型单目深度估计存在跨帧不一致、远距离场景不准确和纹理欺骗等问题。

Result: 在公开和定制数据集上的实验表明，VIM-GS在大场景中具有优越的渲染质量。

Conclusion: VIM-GS成功解决了大场景中单目图像深度估计的挑战，通过结合稀疏和密集深度信息的优势，实现了高质量的新视角合成。

Abstract: VIM-GS is a Gaussian Splatting (GS) framework using monocular images for
novel-view synthesis (NVS) in large scenes. GS typically requires accurate
depth to initiate Gaussian ellipsoids using RGB-D/stereo cameras. Their limited
depth sensing range makes it difficult for GS to work in large scenes.
Monocular images, however, lack depth to guide the learning and lead to
inferior NVS results. Although large foundation models (LFMs) for monocular
depth estimation are available, they suffer from cross-frame inconsistency,
inaccuracy for distant scenes, and ambiguity in deceptive texture cues. This
paper aims to generate dense, accurate depth images from monocular RGB inputs
for high-definite GS rendering. The key idea is to leverage the accurate but
sparse depth from visual-inertial Structure-from-Motion (SfM) to refine the
dense but coarse depth from LFMs. To bridge the sparse input and dense output,
we propose an object-segmented depth propagation algorithm that renders the
depth of pixels of structured objects. Then we develop a dynamic depth
refinement module to handle the crippled SfM depth of dynamic objects and
refine the coarse LFM depth. Experiments using public and customized datasets
demonstrate the superior rendering quality of VIM-GS in large scenes.

Abstract: Bioprinting is a rapidly advancing field that offers a transformative
approach to fabricating tissue and organ models through the precise deposition
of cell-laden bioinks. Ensuring the fidelity and consistency of printed
structures in real-time remains a core challenge, particularly under
constraints imposed by limited imaging data and resource-constrained embedded
hardware. Semantic segmentation of the extrusion process, differentiating
between nozzle, extruded bioink, and surrounding background, enables in situ
monitoring critical to maintaining print quality and biological viability. In
this work, we introduce a lightweight semantic segmentation framework tailored
for real-time bioprinting applications. We present a novel, manually annotated
dataset comprising 787 RGB images captured during the bioprinting process,
labeled across three classes: nozzle, bioink, and background. To achieve fast
and efficient inference suitable for integration with bioprinting systems, we
propose a BioLite U-Net architecture that leverages depthwise separable
convolutions to drastically reduce computational load without compromising
accuracy. Our model is benchmarked against MobileNetV2 and MobileNetV3-based
segmentation baselines using mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), Dice score,
and pixel accuracy. All models were evaluated on a Raspberry Pi 4B to assess
real-world feasibility. The proposed BioLite U-Net achieves an mIoU of 92.85%
and a Dice score of 96.17%, while being over 1300x smaller than
MobileNetV2-DeepLabV3+. On-device inference takes 335 ms per frame,
demonstrating near real-time capability. Compared to MobileNet baselines,
BioLite U-Net offers a superior tradeoff between segmentation accuracy,
efficiency, and deployability, making it highly suitable for intelligent,
closed-loop bioprinting systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STAGE是一种面向分割的工业异常合成方法，通过分级扩散和显式掩码对齐技术，解决了现有方法在纹理细节、背景对齐和细粒度异常生成方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的工业异常合成方法存在两个关键问题：合成的异常缺乏精细纹理细节且与背景对齐不精确；难以生成像素级的细粒度异常。这限制了异常分割性能的提升。

Method: 提出STAGE方法：1）引入清洁背景信息作为先验指导去噪分布；2）采用分级扩散框架，通过异常分支显式记录局部异常；3）使用显式掩码对齐策略逐步对齐合成异常与背景。

Result: 在MVTec和BTAD数据集上的大量实验表明，STAGE在工业异常合成方面达到了最先进的性能，并有效提升了下游异常分割任务的表现。

Conclusion: STAGE通过创新的异常推理策略和分级扩散框架，成功解决了工业异常合成中的关键挑战，为异常分割提供了更高质量的合成数据支持。

Abstract: Segmentation-oriented Industrial Anomaly Synthesis (SIAS) plays a pivotal
role in enhancing the performance of downstream anomaly segmentation, as it
provides an effective means of expanding abnormal data. However, existing SIAS
methods face several critical limitations: (i) the synthesized anomalies often
lack intricate texture details and fail to align precisely with the surrounding
background, and (ii) they struggle to generate fine-grained, pixel-level
anomalies. To address these challenges, we propose Segmentation-oriented
Anomaly synthesis via Graded diffusion with Explicit mask alignment, termed
STAGE. STAGE introduces a novel anomaly inference strategy that incorporates
clean background information as a prior to guide the denoising distribution,
enabling the model to more effectively distinguish and highlight abnormal
foregrounds. Furthermore, it employs a graded diffusion framework with an
anomaly-only branch to explicitly record local anomalies during both the
forward and reverse processes, ensuring that subtle anomalies are not
overlooked. Finally, STAGE incorporates the explicit mask alignment (EMA)
strategy to progressively align the synthesized anomalies with the background,
resulting in context-consistent and structurally coherent generations.
Extensive experiments on the MVTec and BTAD datasets demonstrate that STAGE
achieves state-of-the-art performance in SIAS, which in turn enhances
downstream anomaly segmentation.

Abstract: Brain tumors are serious health problems that require early diagnosis due to
their high mortality rates. Diagnosing tumors by examining Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) images is a process that requires expertise and is prone to
error. Therefore, the need for automated diagnosis systems is increasing day by
day. In this context, a robust and explainable Deep Learning (DL) model for the
classification of brain tumors is proposed. In this study, a publicly available
Figshare dataset containing 3,064 T1-weighted contrast-enhanced brain MRI
images of three tumor types was used. First, the classification performance of
nine well-known CNN architectures was evaluated to determine the most effective
backbone. Among these, EfficientNetV2 demonstrated the best performance and was
selected as the backbone for further development. Subsequently, an
attention-based MLP-Mixer architecture was integrated into EfficientNetV2 to
enhance its classification capability. The performance of the final model was
comprehensively compared with basic CNNs and the methods in the literature.
Additionally, Grad-CAM visualization was used to interpret and validate the
decision-making process of the proposed model. The proposed model's performance
was evaluated using the five-fold cross-validation method. The proposed model
demonstrated superior performance with 99.50% accuracy, 99.47% precision,
99.52% recall and 99.49% F1 score. The results obtained show that the model
outperforms the studies in the literature. Moreover, Grad-CAM visualizations
demonstrate that the model effectively focuses on relevant regions of MRI
images, thus improving interpretability and clinical reliability. A robust deep
learning model for clinical decision support systems has been obtained by
combining EfficientNetV2 and attention-based MLP-Mixer, providing high accuracy
and interpretability in brain tumor classification.

TL;DR: Zo3T是一个零样本测试时训练框架，通过3D感知运动投影、轨迹引导的LoRA适配器和引导场校正，实现高质量的轨迹引导图像到视频生成，无需大量标注数据和微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有轨迹引导I2V生成方法需要大量计算资源进行微调，以及零样本方法忽略3D视角导致运动不真实、潜在空间操作与网络噪声预测不匹配的问题。

Method: 1) 3D感知运动投影：利用场景深度推断进行透视校正的仿射变换；2) 轨迹引导测试时LoRA：动态注入和优化临时LoRA适配器，通过区域特征一致性损失实现运动约束；3) 引导场校正：通过一步前瞻策略优化条件引导场，确保生成过程高效朝向目标轨迹。

Result: Zo3T显著提升了轨迹控制I2V生成的3D真实感和运动准确性，在性能上优于现有的基于训练和零样本方法。

Conclusion: Zo3T框架通过创新的测试时训练机制，成功解决了轨迹引导视频生成中的3D真实性和运动准确性问题，为无需大量标注数据的I2V生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Trajectory-Guided image-to-video (I2V) generation aims to synthesize videos
that adhere to user-specified motion instructions. Existing methods typically
rely on computationally expensive fine-tuning on scarce annotated datasets.
Although some zero-shot methods attempt to trajectory control in the latent
space, they may yield unrealistic motion by neglecting 3D perspective and
creating a misalignment between the manipulated latents and the network's noise
predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce Zo3T, a novel zero-shot
test-time-training framework for trajectory-guided generation with three core
innovations: First, we incorporate a 3D-Aware Kinematic Projection, leveraging
inferring scene depth to derive perspective-correct affine transformations for
target regions. Second, we introduce Trajectory-Guided Test-Time LoRA, a
mechanism that dynamically injects and optimizes ephemeral LoRA adapters into
the denoising network alongside the latent state. Driven by a regional feature
consistency loss, this co-adaptation effectively enforces motion constraints
while allowing the pre-trained model to locally adapt its internal
representations to the manipulated latent, thereby ensuring generative fidelity
and on-manifold adherence. Finally, we develop Guidance Field Rectification,
which refines the denoising evolutionary path by optimizing the conditional
guidance field through a one-step lookahead strategy, ensuring efficient
generative progression towards the target trajectory. Zo3T significantly
enhances 3D realism and motion accuracy in trajectory-controlled I2V
generation, demonstrating superior performance over existing training-based and
zero-shot approaches.

Result: 在PUMA数据集上的大量实验表明，Co-Seg在肿瘤组织和细胞核实例的语义分割、实例分割和全景分割方面均超越了现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 通过协同组织分割和细胞核分割任务，Co-Seg框架能够更好地理解组织病理学图像，为肿瘤微环境和细胞形态分析提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Histopathology image analysis is critical yet challenged by the demand of
segmenting tissue regions and nuclei instances for tumor microenvironment and
cellular morphology analysis. Existing studies focused on tissue semantic
segmentation or nuclei instance segmentation separately, but ignored the
inherent relationship between these two tasks, resulting in insufficient
histopathology understanding. To address this issue, we propose a Co-Seg
framework for collaborative tissue and nuclei segmentation. Specifically, we
introduce a novel co-segmentation paradigm, allowing tissue and nuclei
segmentation tasks to mutually enhance each other. To this end, we first devise
a region-aware prompt encoder (RP-Encoder) to provide high-quality semantic and
instance region prompts as prior constraints. Moreover, we design a mutual
prompt mask decoder (MP-Decoder) that leverages cross-guidance to strengthen
the contextual consistency of both tasks, collaboratively computing semantic
and instance segmentation masks. Extensive experiments on the PUMA dataset
demonstrate that the proposed Co-Seg surpasses state-of-the-arts in the
semantic, instance and panoptic segmentation of tumor tissues and nuclei
instances. The source code is available at https://github.com/xq141839/Co-Seg.

Abstract: Uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly deployed in forest
environments for tasks such as environmental monitoring and search and rescue,
which require safe navigation through dense foliage and precise data
collection. Traditional sensing approaches, including passive multispectral and
RGB imaging, suffer from latency, poor depth resolution, and strong dependence
on ambient light - especially under forest canopies. In this work, we present a
novel event spectroscopy system that simultaneously enables high-resolution,
low-latency depth reconstruction and multispectral imaging using a single
sensor. Depth is reconstructed using structured light, and by modulating the
wavelength of the projected structured light, our system captures spectral
information in controlled bands between 650 nm and 850 nm. We demonstrate up to
$60\%$ improvement in RMSE over commercial depth sensors and validate the
spectral accuracy against a reference spectrometer and commercial multispectral
cameras, demonstrating comparable performance. A portable version limited to
RGB (3 wavelengths) is used to collect real-world depth and spectral data from
a Masoala Rainforest. We demonstrate the use of this prototype for color image
reconstruction and material differentiation between leaves and branches using
spectral and depth data. Our results show that adding depth (available at no
extra effort with our setup) to material differentiation improves the accuracy
by over $30\%$ compared to color-only method. Our system, tested in both lab
and real-world rainforest environments, shows strong performance in depth
estimation, RGB reconstruction, and material differentiation - paving the way
for lightweight, integrated, and robust UAV perception and data collection in
complex natural environments.

Abstract: With the rapid development of computer vision and machine learning, automated
methods for pothole detection and recognition based on image and video data
have received significant attention. It is of great significance for social
development to conduct an in-depth analysis of road images through feature
extraction, thereby achieving automatic identification of the pothole condition
in new images. Consequently, this is the main issue addressed in this study.
Based on preprocessing techniques such as standardization, normalization, and
data augmentation applied to the collected raw dataset, we continuously
improved the network model based on experimental results. Ultimately, we
constructed a deep learning feature extraction network
ResNet50-EfficientNet-RegNet model based on transfer learning. This model
exhibits high classification accuracy and computational efficiency. In terms of
model evaluation, this study employed a comparative evaluation approach by
comparing the performance of the proposed transfer learning model with other

analysis was conducted based on metrics such as Accuracy, Recall, Precision,
F1-score, and FPS, to assess the classification performance of the transfer
learning model proposed in this paper. The results demonstrate that our model
exhibits high performance in terms of recognition speed and accuracy,
surpassing the performance of other models. Through careful parameter selection
and model optimization, our transfer learning model achieved a classification

Abstract: Event cameras offer unique advantages such as high temporal resolution, low
latency, and high dynamic range, making them more and more popular for vision
tasks under challenging light conditions. However, their high cost, limited
resolution, and lack of features such as autofocus hinder their broad adoption,
particularly for early-stage development and prototyping. In this work, we
present Raw2Event, a complete hardware-software system that enables real-time
event generation from low-cost raw frame-based cameras. By leveraging direct
access to raw Bayer data and bypassing traditional image signal processors
(ISP), our system is able to utilize the full potential of camera hardware,
delivering higher dynamic range, higher resolution, and more faithful output
than RGB-based frame-to-event converters.
  Built upon the DVS-Voltmeter model, Raw2Event features a configurable
simulation framework optimized for deployment on embedded platforms. We further
design a data acquisition pipeline that supports synchronized recording of raw,
RGB, and event streams, facilitating downstream evaluation and dataset
creation. Experimental results show that Raw2Event can generate event streams
closely resembling those from real event cameras, while benefiting from higher
resolution and autofocus capabilities. The system also supports user-intuitive
parameter tuning, enabling flexible adaptation to various application
requirements. Finally, we deploy the system on a Raspberry Pi for real-time
operation, providing a scalable and cost-effective solution for event-based
vision research and early-stage system development.

Abstract: Dark humor in online memes poses unique challenges due to its reliance on
implicit, sensitive, and culturally contextual cues. To address the lack of
resources and methods for detecting dark humor in multimodal content, we
introduce a novel dataset of 4,379 Reddit memes annotated for dark humor,
target category (gender, mental health, violence, race, disability, and other),
and a three-level intensity rating (mild, moderate, severe). Building on this
resource, we propose a reasoning-augmented framework that first generates
structured explanations for each meme using a Large Vision-Language Model
(VLM). Through a Role-Reversal Self-Loop, VLM adopts the author's perspective
to iteratively refine its explanations, ensuring completeness and alignment. We
then extract textual features from both the OCR transcript and the self-refined
reasoning via a text encoder, while visual features are obtained using a vision
transformer. A Tri-stream Cross-Reasoning Network (TCRNet) fuses these three
streams, text, image, and reasoning, via pairwise attention mechanisms,
producing a unified representation for classification. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach outperforms strong baselines across three tasks:
dark humor detection, target identification, and intensity prediction. The
dataset, annotations, and code are released to facilitate further research in
multimodal humor understanding and content moderation. Code and Dataset are

Abstract: This article presents UrbanTwin datasets - high-fidelity, realistic replicas
of three public roadside lidar datasets: LUMPI, V2X-Real-IC, and TUMTraf-I.
Each UrbanTwin dataset contains 10K annotated frames corresponding to one of
the public datasets. Annotations include 3D bounding boxes, instance
segmentation labels, and tracking IDs for six object classes, along with
semantic segmentation labels for nine classes. These datasets are synthesized
using emulated lidar sensors within realistic digital twins, modeled based on
surrounding geometry, road alignment at lane level, and the lane topology and
vehicle movement patterns at intersections of the actual locations
corresponding to each real dataset. Due to the precise digital twin modeling,
the synthetic datasets are well aligned with their real counterparts, offering
strong standalone and augmentative value for training deep learning models on
tasks such as 3D object detection, tracking, and semantic and instance
segmentation. We evaluate the alignment of the synthetic replicas through
statistical and structural similarity analysis with real data, and further
demonstrate their utility by training 3D object detection models solely on
synthetic data and testing them on real, unseen data. The high similarity
scores and improved detection performance, compared to the models trained on
real data, indicate that the UrbanTwin datasets effectively enhance existing
benchmark datasets by increasing sample size and scene diversity. In addition,
the digital twins can be adapted to test custom scenarios by modifying the
design and dynamics of the simulations. To our knowledge, these are the first
digitally synthesized datasets that can replace in-domain real-world datasets
for lidar perception tasks. UrbanTwin datasets are publicly available at

Abstract: Segmenting 3D assets into their constituent parts is crucial for enhancing 3D
understanding, facilitating model reuse, and supporting various applications
such as part generation. However, current methods face limitations such as poor
robustness when dealing with complex objects and cannot fully automate the
process. In this paper, we propose a native 3D point-promptable part
segmentation model termed P3-SAM, designed to fully automate the segmentation
of any 3D objects into components. Inspired by SAM, P3-SAM consists of a
feature extractor, multiple segmentation heads, and an IoU predictor, enabling
interactive segmentation for users. We also propose an algorithm to
automatically select and merge masks predicted by our model for part instance
segmentation. Our model is trained on a newly built dataset containing nearly
3.7 million models with reasonable segmentation labels. Comparisons show that
our method achieves precise segmentation results and strong robustness on any
complex objects, attaining state-of-the-art performance. Our code will be
released soon.

Motivation: 自主驾驶领域需要生成稀缺和多样化的场景进行感知训练，但现有方法存在应用局限性：CG方法缺乏多样性且难以扩展，学习方法受限于特定对象类别且需要大量多感知器数据

Method: 提出一种可扩展的real2sim2real系统，利用3D生成技术自动化进行资产挖掘、生成和稀缺案例数据合成

Conclusion: 通过3D生成技术构建的real2sim2real系统有效解决了自主驾驶感知训练中的数据稀缺问题，提供了一种可扩展且通用性更强的模拟解决方案

Abstract: In the field of autonomous driving, sensor simulation is essential for
generating rare and diverse scenarios that are difficult to capture in
real-world environments. Current solutions fall into two categories: 1)
CG-based methods, such as CARLA, which lack diversity and struggle to scale to
the vast array of rare cases required for robust perception training; and 2)
learning-based approaches, such as NeuSim, which are limited to specific object
categories (vehicles) and require extensive multi-sensor data, hindering their
applicability to generic objects. To address these limitations, we propose a
scalable real2sim2real system that leverages 3D generation to automate asset
mining, generation, and rare-case data synthesis.

Abstract: We introduce MIORe and VAR-MIORe, two novel multi-task datasets that address
critical limitations in current motion restoration benchmarks. Designed with
high-frame-rate (1000 FPS) acquisition and professional-grade optics, our
datasets capture a broad spectrum of motion scenarios, which include complex
ego-camera movements, dynamic multi-subject interactions, and depth-dependent
blur effects. By adaptively averaging frames based on computed optical flow
metrics, MIORe generates consistent motion blur, and preserves sharp inputs for
video frame interpolation and optical flow estimation. VAR-MIORe further
extends by spanning a variable range of motion magnitudes, from minimal to
extreme, establishing the first benchmark to offer explicit control over motion
amplitude. We provide high-resolution, scalable ground truths that challenge
existing algorithms under both controlled and adverse conditions, paving the
way for next-generation research of various image and video restoration tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类对脸部更加敏感，现有图像定制方法在多参考图像中存在身份混淆问题，限制了身份的可扩展性。

Method: 采用多对多匹配范式，将多身份生成重新表述为全局分配优化问题，通过扩散模型的强化学习来实现多身份一致性。

Result: 实验表明UMO显著提高了身份一致性，减少了身份混淆，在身份保持维度上达到了开源方法的新最先进水平。

Conclusion: UMO框架有效解决了多身份图像定制中的身份混淆问题，为现有图像定制方法提供了通用的多身份一致性解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in image customization exhibit a wide range of
application prospects due to stronger customization capabilities. However,
since we humans are more sensitive to faces, a significant challenge remains in
preserving consistent identity while avoiding identity confusion with
multi-reference images, limiting the identity scalability of customization
models. To address this, we present UMO, a Unified Multi-identity Optimization
framework, designed to maintain high-fidelity identity preservation and
alleviate identity confusion with scalability. With "multi-to-multi matching"
paradigm, UMO reformulates multi-identity generation as a global assignment
optimization problem and unleashes multi-identity consistency for existing
image customization methods generally through reinforcement learning on
diffusion models. To facilitate the training of UMO, we develop a scalable
customization dataset with multi-reference images, consisting of both
synthesised and real parts. Additionally, we propose a new metric to measure
identity confusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMO not only
improves identity consistency significantly, but also reduces identity
confusion on several image customization methods, setting a new
state-of-the-art among open-source methods along the dimension of identity
preserving. Code and model: https://github.com/bytedance/UMO

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于对比学习的视频年龄分级分类方法，使用LRCN+注意力机制架构，在Contextual Contrastive Learning框架下达到88%准确率，可实时部署用于MPAA评级。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频年龄分级方法需要大量标注数据、泛化能力差且特征学习效率低，无法满足流媒体平台对自动化内容合规的需求。

Method: 采用对比学习（实例判别、上下文对比、多视图对比三种框架），结合LRCN（CNN+LSTM）骨干网络和Bahdanau注意力机制，使用NT-Xent等对比损失函数。

Result: 在Contextual Contrastive Learning框架下达到88%准确率和0.8815 F1分数，能有效区分PG-13和R级等边界案例。

Conclusion: 提出的混合架构在对比学习框架下表现出色，已部署为实时Web应用，为流媒体平台提供高效的自动化内容合规解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid growth of visual content consumption across platforms necessitates
automated video classification for age-suitability standards like the MPAA
rating system (G, PG, PG-13, R). Traditional methods struggle with large
labeled data requirements, poor generalization, and inefficient feature
learning. To address these challenges, we employ contrastive learning for
improved discrimination and adaptability, exploring three frameworks: Instance
Discrimination, Contextual Contrastive Learning, and Multi-View Contrastive
Learning. Our hybrid architecture integrates an LRCN (CNN+LSTM) backbone with a
Bahdanau attention mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the
Contextual Contrastive Learning framework, with 88% accuracy and an F1 score of
0.8815. By combining CNNs for spatial features, LSTMs for temporal modeling,
and attention mechanisms for dynamic frame prioritization, the model excels in
fine-grained borderline distinctions, such as differentiating PG-13 and R-rated
content. We evaluate the model's performance across various contrastive loss
functions, including NT-Xent, NT-logistic, and Margin Triplet, demonstrating
the robustness of our proposed architecture. To ensure practical application,
the model is deployed as a web application for real-time MPAA rating
classification, offering an efficient solution for automated content compliance
across streaming platforms.

Motivation: 当前AI辅助放射学诊断主要依赖单一任务的窄模型，无法覆盖广泛的成像模态、疾病和放射学发现。基础模型在放射学领域的潜力尚未充分实现。

Method: 使用一家大型医院多年来的全部横断面成像输出数据（15万次检查，130TB）训练Curia基础模型，并在新构建的19任务外部验证基准上进行评估。

Conclusion: Curia展示了基础模型在放射学领域的巨大潜力，为加速该领域发展，作者在Hugging Face上发布了模型权重。

Abstract: AI-assisted radiological interpretation is based on predominantly narrow,
single-task models. This approach is impractical for covering the vast spectrum
of imaging modalities, diseases, and radiological findings. Foundation models
(FMs) hold the promise of broad generalization across modalities and in
low-data settings. However, this potential has remained largely unrealized in
radiology. We introduce Curia, a foundation model trained on the entire
cross-sectional imaging output of a major hospital over several years, which to
our knowledge is the largest such corpus of real-world data-encompassing
150,000 exams (130 TB). On a newly curated 19-task external validation
benchmark, Curia accurately identifies organs, detects conditions like brain
hemorrhages and myocardial infarctions, and predicts outcomes in tumor staging.
Curia meets or surpasses the performance of radiologists and recent foundation
models, and exhibits clinically significant emergent properties in
cross-modality, and low-data regimes. To accelerate progress, we release our
base model's weights at https://huggingface.co/raidium/curia.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究如何通过过渡学习调整基础模型和整合多模态数据来支持外科手术数据科学，在肠胰手术视频数据集上进行医院住院时间预测、手术后并发症预测和手术时相识别任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索通过基础模型的领域适应和多模态数据整合来提升外科手术数据科学的性能，利用公共通用基础模型来支持手术决策。

Method: 使用V-JEPA作为单模态基础模型，通过在未标注的手术视频数据上进行微调来实现领域适应，并通过训练独立编码器整合手术室的其他时间分辨数据流。

Result: 领域特定数据的微调显著提升了模型性能，多模态数据整合在内部数据集上同样有效。在HeiCo数据集上，单模态基线模型的准确度已经跟EndoVis2017挑战赛的最佳性能相当，微调后进一步提升。

Conclusion: 这项研究证明了通用基础模型在手术数据科学中的潜力，领域适应和多模态数据整合是提升性能的有效方法，为进一步研究提供了代码和模型权重。

Abstract: We investigate how both the adaptation of a generic foundation model via
transfer learning and the integration of complementary modalities from the
operating room (OR) can support surgical data science. To this end, we use
V-JEPA as the single-modality foundation of a multimodal model for minimally
invasive surgery support. We analyze how the model's downstream performance can
benefit (a) from finetuning on unlabeled surgical video data and (b) from
providing additional time-resolved data streams from the OR in a multimodal
setup.
  In an in-house dataset of liver surgery videos, we analyze the tasks of
predicting hospital length of stay and postoperative complications. In videos
of the public HeiCo dataset, we analyze the task of surgical phase recognition.
As a baseline, we apply pretrained V-JEPA to all tasks. We then finetune it on
unlabeled, held-out videos to investigate its change in performance after
domain adaptation. Following the idea of modular decision support networks, we
integrate additional data streams from the OR by training a separate encoder to
form a shared representation space with V-JEPA's embeddings.
  Our experiments show that finetuning on domain-specific data increases model
performance. On the in-house data, integrating additional time-resolved data
likewise benefits the model. On the HeiCo data, accuracy of the pretrained
video-only, single-modality baseline setup is on par with the top-performing
submissions of the EndoVis2017 challenge, while finetuning on domain-specific
data increases accuracy further. Our results thus demonstrate how surgical data
science can leverage public, generic foundation models. Likewise, they indicate
the potential of domain adaptation and of integrating suitable complementary
data streams from the OR. To support further research, we release our code and
model weights at https://github.com/DigitalSurgeryLab-Basel/ML-CDS-2025.

study lays the groundwork for future exploration into defense mechanisms
tailored for real-world traffic sign recognition systems.

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于深度学习的自动化类风湿关节炎X光评分框架ARTSS，通过多阶段深度学习模型处理全手X光图像，有效解决了关节消失和图像序列长度不一的问题，显著提高了评分准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动评估类风湿关节炎严重程度（TSS评分）耗时且主观性较强，存在观察者间和观察者内变异性问题，需要自动化解决方案来提高评分的一致性和效率。

Abstract: Assessing the severity of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) using the Total Sharp/Van
Der Heijde Score (TSS) is crucial, but manual scoring is often time-consuming
and subjective. This study introduces an Automated Radiographic Sharp Scoring
(ARTSS) framework that leverages deep learning to analyze full-hand X-ray
images, aiming to reduce inter- and intra-observer variability. The research
uniquely accommodates patients with joint disappearance and variable-length
image sequences. We developed ARTSS using data from 970 patients, structured
into four stages: I) Image pre-processing and re-orientation using ResNet50,
II) Hand segmentation using UNet.3, III) Joint identification using YOLOv7, and
IV) TSS prediction using models such as VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, DenseNet201,
EfficientNetB0, and Vision Transformer (ViT). We evaluated model performance
with Intersection over Union (IoU), Mean Average Precision (MAP), mean absolute
error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Huber loss. The average TSS
from two radiologists was used as the ground truth. Model training employed
3-fold cross-validation, with each fold consisting of 452 training and 227
validation samples, and external testing included 291 unseen subjects. Our
joint identification model achieved 99% accuracy. The best-performing model,
ViT, achieved a notably low Huber loss of 0.87 for TSS prediction. Our results
demonstrate the potential of deep learning to automate RA scoring, which can
significantly enhance clinical practice. Our approach addresses the challenge
of joint disappearance and variable joint numbers, offers timesaving benefits,
reduces inter- and intra-reader variability, improves radiologist accuracy, and
aids rheumatologists in making more informed decisions.

Motivation: 解决现实场景中多视图重建常出现的拓扑伪影问题，当前方法基于等距变形或ARAP变形的假设在拓扑配置变化时会失效。

Method: 提出拓扑自适应变形模型，联合优化具有适当拓扑的模板网格及其与待匹配形状的对齐，在ARAP和双射关联约束下提取对应关系。

Result: 方法适用于高度非等距形状和包含拓扑伪影的形状，包括噪声多视图重建，在3D对齐质量上甚至优于基于大数据集训练的方法。

Conclusion: 该拓扑自适应方法能够有效处理拓扑变化情况下的非刚性3D网格匹配问题，无需依赖数据先验，在实际应用中表现出色。

Abstract: Non-rigid 3D mesh matching is a critical step in computer vision and computer
graphics pipelines. We tackle matching meshes that contain topological
artefacts which can break the assumption made by current approaches. While
Functional Maps assume the deformation induced by the ground truth
correspondences to be near-isometric, ARAP-like deformation-guided approaches
assume the latter to be ARAP. Neither assumption holds in certain topological
configurations of the input shapes. We are motivated by real-world scenarios
such as per-frame multi-view reconstructions, often suffering from topological
artefacts. To this end, we propose a topology-adaptive deformation model
allowing changes in shape topology to align shape pairs under ARAP and
bijective association constraints. Using this model, we jointly optimise for a
template mesh with adequate topology and for its alignment with the shapes to
be matched to extract correspondences. We show that, while not relying on any
data-driven prior, our approach applies to highly non-isometric shapes and
shapes with topological artefacts, including noisy per-frame multi-view
reconstructions, even outperforming methods trained on large datasets in 3D
alignment quality.

Abstract: Automatic License-Plate Recognition (ALPR) plays a pivotal role in
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) as a fundamental element of Smart
Cities. However, due to its high variability, ALPR faces challenging issues
more efficiently addressed by deep learning techniques. In this paper, a
selective Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is proposed for deblurring in
the preprocessing step, coupled with the state-of-the-art You-Only-Look-Once
(YOLO)v5 object detection architectures for License-Plate Detection (LPD), and
the integrated Character Segmentation (CS) and Character Recognition (CR)
steps. The selective preprocessing bypasses unnecessary and sometimes
counter-productive input manipulations, while YOLOv5 LPD/CS+CR delivers high
accuracy and low computing cost. As a result, YOLOv5 achieves a detection time
of 0.026 seconds for both LP and CR detection stages, facilitating real-time
applications with exceptionally rapid responsiveness. Moreover, the proposed
model achieves accuracy rates of 95\% and 97\% in the LPD and CR detection
phases, respectively. Furthermore, the inclusion of the Deblur-GAN
pre-processor significantly improves detection accuracy by nearly 40\%,
especially when encountering blurred License Plates (LPs).To train and test the
learning components, we generated and publicly released our blur and ALPR
datasets (using Iranian license plates as a use-case), which are more
representative of close-to-real-life ad-hoc situations. The findings
demonstrate that employing the state-of-the-art YOLO model results in excellent
overall precision and detection time, making it well-suited for portable
applications. Additionally, integrating the Deblur-GAN model as a preliminary
processing step enhances the overall effectiveness of our comprehensive model,
particularly when confronted with blurred scenes captured by the camera as
input.

Result: 在二值分割开发任务中达到竞争性的准确度，同时参数数量显著减少且推理速度更快。

Conclusion: 该模型为实时和资源有限的临床环境提供了一个实用的解决方案，在保持性能的同时大幅提升了效率。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a critical task in clinical workflows,
particularly for the detection and delineation of pathological regions. While
convolutional architectures like U-Net have become standard for such tasks,
their limited receptive field restricts global context modeling. Recent efforts
integrating transformers have addressed this, but often result in deep,
computationally expensive models unsuitable for real-time use. In this work, we
present a novel end-to-end lightweight architecture designed specifically for
real-time binary medical image segmentation. Our model combines a Swin
Transformer-like encoder with a U-Net-like decoder, connected via skip pathways
to preserve spatial detail while capturing contextual information. Unlike
existing designs such as Swin Transformer or U-Net, our architecture is
significantly shallower and competitively efficient. To improve the encoder's
ability to learn meaningful features without relying on large amounts of
labeled data, we first train it using Barlow Twins, a self-supervised learning
method that helps the model focus on important patterns by reducing unnecessary
repetition in the learned features. After this pretraining, we fine-tune the
entire model for our specific task. Experiments on benchmark binary
segmentation tasks demonstrate that our model achieves competitive accuracy
with substantially reduced parameter count and faster inference, positioning it
as a practical alternative for deployment in real-time and resource-limited
clinical environments. The code for our method is available at Github

Conclusion: BIR-Adapter提供了一种高效、低复杂度的盲图像恢复解决方案，其适配器设计使其具有良好的可扩展性和应用前景。

Abstract: This paper introduces BIR-Adapter, a low-complexity blind image restoration
adapter for diffusion models. The BIR-Adapter enables the utilization of the
prior of pre-trained large-scale diffusion models on blind image restoration
without training any auxiliary feature extractor. We take advantage of the
robustness of pretrained models. We extract features from degraded images via
the model itself and extend the self-attention mechanism with these degraded
features. We introduce a sampling guidance mechanism to reduce hallucinations.
We perform experiments on synthetic and real-world degradations and demonstrate
that BIR-Adapter achieves competitive or better performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods while having significantly lower complexity.
Additionally, its adapter-based design enables integration into other diffusion
models, enabling broader applications in image restoration tasks. We showcase
this by extending a super-resolution-only model to perform better under
additional unknown degradations.

TL;DR: FoMo4Wheat是首个作物领域视觉基础模型，通过在最大最多样的小麦图像数据集ImAg4Wheat上进行自监督预训练，在10个田间视觉任务中持续超越通用域预训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用域预训练模型在农业视觉监测中泛化能力不足，因为精细多变的冠层结构与波动的田间条件相互作用，需要作物特定的基础模型。

Method: 使用自监督学习方法在ImAg4Wheat数据集（250万张高分辨率图像，覆盖10年30个全球站点、2000+基因型和500+环境条件）上进行小麦特定预训练。

Result: FoMo4Wheat模型在冠层和器官级别的10个田间视觉任务中一致优于最先进的通用域预训练模型，且表示对小麦具有鲁棒性并可迁移到其他作物和杂草。

Conclusion: 作物特定基础模型对可靠的田间感知具有重要价值，为构建具有跨物种和跨任务能力的通用作物基础模型指明了方向。

Abstract: Vision-driven field monitoring is central to digital agriculture, yet models
built on general-domain pretrained backbones often fail to generalize across
tasks, owing to the interaction of fine, variable canopy structures with
fluctuating field conditions. We present FoMo4Wheat, one of the first
crop-domain vision foundation model pretrained with self-supervision on
ImAg4Wheat, the largest and most diverse wheat image dataset to date (2.5
million high-resolution images collected over a decade at 30 global sites,
spanning >2,000 genotypes and >500 environmental conditions). This
wheat-specific pretraining yields representations that are robust for wheat and
transferable to other crops and weeds. Across ten in-field vision tasks at
canopy and organ levels, FoMo4Wheat models consistently outperform
state-of-the-art models pretrained on general-domain dataset. These results
demonstrate the value of crop-specific foundation models for reliable in-field
perception and chart a path toward a universal crop foundation model with
cross-species and cross-task capabilities. FoMo4Wheat models and the ImAg4Wheat
dataset are publicly available online: https://github.com/PheniX-Lab/FoMo4Wheat

TL;DR: IRG框架通过交替文本推理和图像合成来提升文本到图像生成的质量，在多个基准测试中获得5-10个百分点的绝对提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态理解生成模型在图像生成能力上有显著进步，但在指令跟随和细节保持方面仍与GPT-4o等紧密耦合系统存在差距，受交错推理最新进展的启发

Method: 提出交错推理生成(IRG)框架，交替进行基于文本的思考和图像合成；开发IRGL训练方法，包含两个子目标：强化初始思考生成阶段和实现高质量文本反思；构建IRGL-300K数据集，采用两阶段训练策略

Result: 在GenEval、WISE、TIIF、GenAI-Bench和OneIG-EN等基准测试中获得5-10个百分点的绝对增益，视觉质量和细粒度保真度有显著改善

Conclusion: 交错推理方法能有效提升文本到图像生成的质量和细节保持能力，实现了最先进的性能表现

Abstract: Unified multimodal understanding and generation models recently have achieve
significant improvement in image generation capability, yet a large gap remains
in instruction following and detail preservation compared to systems that
tightly couple comprehension with generation such as GPT-4o. Motivated by
recent advances in interleaving reasoning, we explore whether such reasoning
can further improve Text-to-Image (T2I) generation. We introduce Interleaving
Reasoning Generation (IRG), a framework that alternates between text-based
thinking and image synthesis: the model first produces a text-based thinking to
guide an initial image, then reflects on the result to refine fine-grained
details, visual quality, and aesthetics while preserving semantics. To train
IRG effectively, we propose Interleaving Reasoning Generation Learning (IRGL),
which targets two sub-goals: (1) strengthening the initial think-and-generate
stage to establish core content and base quality, and (2) enabling high-quality
textual reflection and faithful implementation of those refinements in a
subsequent image. We curate IRGL-300K, a dataset organized into six decomposed
learning modes that jointly cover learning text-based thinking, and full
thinking-image trajectories. Starting from a unified foundation model that
natively emits interleaved text-image outputs, our two-stage training first
builds robust thinking and reflection, then efficiently tunes the IRG pipeline
in the full thinking-image trajectory data. Extensive experiments show SoTA
performance, yielding absolute gains of 5-10 points on GenEval, WISE, TIIF,
GenAI-Bench, and OneIG-EN, alongside substantial improvements in visual quality
and fine-grained fidelity. The code, model weights and datasets will be
released in: https://github.com/Osilly/Interleaving-Reasoning-Generation .

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为H₂OT的分层即插即用剪枝-恢复框架，用于高效的基于Transformer的视频3D人体姿态估计，通过动态选择代表性帧的token来减少计算成本，同时保持估计精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频姿态Transformer(VPTs)计算成本高，在资源受限设备上不实用，需要一种既能提高效率又能保持准确性的方法。

Method: 采用分层剪枝-恢复框架，包含Token剪枝模块(TPM)动态选择代表性token，和Token恢复模块(TRM)恢复完整时空信息，可集成到各种VPT模型中。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的广泛实验证明了该方法的有效性和效率，既能显著减少计算量，又能保持高估计精度。

Conclusion: 研究表明维持完整姿态序列是不必要的，少量代表性帧的姿态token即可实现高效率和高精度，为资源受限设备上的3D人体姿态估计提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Transformers have been successfully applied in the field of video-based 3D
human pose estimation. However, the high computational costs of these video
pose transformers (VPTs) make them impractical on resource-constrained devices.
In this paper, we present a hierarchical plug-and-play pruning-and-recovering
framework, called Hierarchical Hourglass Tokenizer (H$_{2}$OT), for efficient
transformer-based 3D human pose estimation from videos. H$_{2}$OT begins with
progressively pruning pose tokens of redundant frames and ends with recovering
full-length sequences, resulting in a few pose tokens in the intermediate
transformer blocks and thus improving the model efficiency. It works with two
key modules, namely, a Token Pruning Module (TPM) and a Token Recovering Module
(TRM). TPM dynamically selects a few representative tokens to eliminate the
redundancy of video frames, while TRM restores the detailed spatio-temporal
information based on the selected tokens, thereby expanding the network output
to the original full-length temporal resolution for fast inference. Our method
is general-purpose: it can be easily incorporated into common VPT models on
both seq2seq and seq2frame pipelines while effectively accommodating different
token pruning and recovery strategies. In addition, our H$_{2}$OT reveals that
maintaining the full pose sequence is unnecessary, and a few pose tokens of
representative frames can achieve both high efficiency and estimation accuracy.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate both the
effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. Code and models are
available at https://github.com/NationalGAILab/HoT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现深度学习去霏方法在真实世界霏图上性能下降的根本原因是收集的清潔数据不能严格满足理想条件，导致真实域和合成域大气物理模型不一致

Method: 提出基于域统统一的合成到真实去霏方法，尝试统一真实和合成域间的关系

Result: 实验结果定性和定量证明所提方法在真实世界图像上显著超过现有最优方法

Conclusion: 通过域统统一的方法可以有效解决分布偏移问题，使去霏模型更符合实际情况

Abstract: Due to distribution shift, the performance of deep learning-based method for
image dehazing is adversely affected when applied to real-world hazy images. In
this paper, we find that such deviation in dehazing task between real and
synthetic domains may come from the imperfect collection of clean data. Owing
to the complexity of the scene and the effect of depth, the collected clean
data cannot strictly meet the ideal conditions, which makes the atmospheric
physics model in the real domain inconsistent with that in the synthetic
domain. For this reason, we come up with a synthetic-to-real dehazing method
based on domain unification, which attempts to unify the relationship between
the real and synthetic domain, thus to let the dehazing model more in line with
the actual situation. Extensive experiments qualitatively and quantitatively
demonstrate that the proposed dehazing method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on real-world images.

Motivation: RED框架使用预训练去噪器作为隐式正则化器，虽然能够获得高保真度重建，但黑盒去噪器导致的不稳定性需要解决

Method: 利用Koopman算子捕捉RED在低维特征空间中的局部动力学，通过谱半径检测不稳定性，形成适应性步长规则

Result: 方法模型无关，较少超开销，无需重新训练，多个预训练去噪器验证了Koopman稳定方法的有效性

Conclusion: 提出的Koopman稳定方法能够有效解决RED框架的不稳定问题，为黑盒去噪器在模型基于重建中的稳定应用提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: The widely used RED (Regularization-by-Denoising) framework uses pretrained
denoisers as implicit regularizers for model-based reconstruction. Although RED
generally yields high-fidelity reconstructions, the use of black-box denoisers
can sometimes lead to instability. In this letter, we propose a data-driven
mechanism to stabilize RED using the Koopman operator, a classical tool for
analyzing dynamical systems. Specifically, we use the operator to capture the
local dynamics of RED in a low-dimensional feature space, and its spectral
radius is used to detect instability and formulate an adaptive step-size rule
that is model-agnostic, has modest overhead, and requires no retraining. We
test this with several pretrained denoisers to demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed Koopman stabilization.

Motivation: 从多视角心脏磁共振图像学习3D+t心脏形状完整与生成需要大量高分辨率3D全心分割数据，但实际数据量有限，需要开发能够在限到数据下学习形状先验知识的深度生成模型。

Method: 1）引入潜在修正流生成3D心脏形状进行数据增帽
2）训练标签完整网络从稀疏多视角分割重建3D+t形状
3）提出CardiacFlow一步生成流模型，以周期性高斯内核编码时间帧作为条件

Conclusion: 流匹配技术能够有效地学习心脏形状的深度生成模型，在限到数据情况下通过数据增帽显著提升形状完整性能，CardiacFlow模型能够生成高质量且具有良好周期一致性的3D+t心脏形状。

Abstract: Learning 3D+t shape completion and generation from multi-view cardiac
magnetic resonance (CMR) images requires a large amount of high-resolution 3D
whole-heart segmentations (WHS) to capture shape priors. In this work, we
leverage flow matching techniques to learn deep generative flows for
augmentation, completion, and generation of 3D+t shapes of four cardiac
chambers represented implicitly by segmentations. Firstly, we introduce a
latent rectified flow to generate 3D cardiac shapes for data augmentation,
learnt from a limited number of 3D WHS data. Then, a label completion network
is trained on both real and synthetic data to reconstruct 3D+t shapes from
sparse multi-view CMR segmentations. Lastly, we propose CardiacFlow, a novel
one-step generative flow model for efficient 3D+t four-chamber cardiac shape
generation, conditioned on the periodic Gaussian kernel encoding of time
frames. The experiments on the WHS datasets demonstrate that flow-based data
augmentation reduces geometric errors by 16% in 3D shape completion. The
evaluation on the UK Biobank dataset validates that CardiacFlow achieves
superior generation quality and periodic consistency compared to existing
baselines.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered deep learning has advanced brain tumor
diagnosis in Internet of Things (IoT)-healthcare systems, achieving high
accuracy with large datasets. Brain health is critical to human life, and
accurate diagnosis is essential for effective treatment. Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) provides key data for brain tumor detection, serving as a major
source of big data for AI-driven image classification. In this study, we
classified glioma, meningioma, and pituitary tumors from MRI images using
Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN) and UNet architectures. We
also applied Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and CNN-based transfer
learning models such as Inception-V3, EfficientNetB4, and VGG19. Model
performance was assessed using F-score, recall, precision, and accuracy. The
Fast R-CNN achieved the best results with 99% accuracy, 98.5% F-score, 99.5%
Area Under the Curve (AUC), 99.4% recall, and 98.5% precision. Combining R-CNN,
UNet, and transfer learning enables earlier diagnosis and more effective
treatment in IoT-healthcare systems, improving patient outcomes. IoT devices
such as wearable monitors and smart imaging systems continuously collect
real-time data, which AI algorithms analyze to provide immediate insights for
timely interventions and personalized care. For external cohort cross-dataset
validation, EfficientNetB2 achieved the strongest performance among fine-tuned
EfficientNet models, with 92.11% precision, 92.11% recall/sensitivity, 95.96%
specificity, 92.02% F1-score, and 92.23% accuracy. These findings underscore
the robustness and reliability of AI models in handling diverse datasets,
reinforcing their potential to enhance brain tumor classification and patient

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的2D Bjontegaard delta指标无法充分评估视频编码系统的复杂度维度，需要扩展到3D RDC空间来更全面地评估编解码器性能。

Method: 将2D BD指标推广到3D RDC体积，使用拉格朗日成本函数D+λR+γC，通过选择不同的(λ,γ)参数对来代表不同的应用场景需求。

Result: 在RDC计算约束下，只有四个神经视频编解码器在不同应用场景下表现最佳，结果具有信息性和意外性。

Conclusion: 提出的RDC分析框架能够有效比较不同编解码器在整个应用空间中的性能，为视频编码系统选择提供了更全面的评估方法。

Abstract: We study the decision-making process for choosing video compression systems
through a rate-distortion-complexity (RDC) analysis. We discuss the 2D
Bjontegaard delta (BD) metric and formulate generalizations in an attempt to
extend its notions to the 3D RDC volume. We follow that discussion with another
one on the computation of metrics in the RDC volume, and on how to define and
measure the cost of a coder-decoder (codec) pair, where the codec is
characterized by a cloud of points in the RDC space. We use a Lagrangian cost
$D+\lambda R + \gamma C$, such that choosing the best video codec among a
number of candidates for an application demands selecting appropriate
$(\lambda, \gamma)$ values. Thus, we argue that an application may be
associated with a $(\lambda, \gamma)$ point in the application space. An
example streaming application was given as a case study to set a particular
point in the $(\lambda, \gamma)$ plane. The result is that we can compare
Lagrangian costs in an RDC volume for different codecs for a given application.
Furthermore, we can span the plane and compare codecs for the entire
application space filled with different $(\lambda, \gamma)$ choices. We then
compared several state-of-the-art neural video codecs using the proposed
metrics. Results are informative and surprising. We found that, within our RDC
computation constraints, only four neural video codecs came out as the best
suited for any application, depending on where its desirable $(\lambda,
\gamma)$ lies.

Abstract: Vision-language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
generating 2D images under various conditions; however the impressive
performance of these models in 2D is largely enabled by extensive, readily
available pretrained foundation models. Critically, comparable pretrained
foundation models do not exist for 3D, significantly limiting progress in this
domain. As a result, the potential of vision-language models to produce
high-resolution 3D counterfactual medical images conditioned solely on natural
language descriptions remains completely unexplored. Addressing this gap would
enable powerful clinical and research applications, such as personalized
counterfactual explanations, simulation of disease progression scenarios, and
enhanced medical training by visualizing hypothetical medical conditions in
realistic detail. Our work takes a meaningful step toward addressing this
challenge by introducing a framework capable of generating high-resolution 3D
counterfactual medical images of synthesized patients guided by free-form
language prompts. We adapt state-of-the-art 3D diffusion models with
enhancements from Simple Diffusion and incorporate augmented conditioning to
improve text alignment and image quality. To our knowledge, this represents the
first demonstration of a language-guided native-3D diffusion model applied
specifically to neurological imaging data, where faithful three-dimensional
modeling is essential to represent the brain's three-dimensional structure.
Through results on two distinct neurological MRI datasets, our framework
successfully simulates varying counterfactual lesion loads in Multiple
Sclerosis (MS), and cognitive states in Alzheimer's disease, generating
high-quality images while preserving subject fidelity in synthetically
generated medical images. Our results lay the groundwork for prompt-driven
disease progression analysis within 3D medical imaging.

Motivation: 当前手术语义分割研究主要关注手术工具而忽略解剖结构，且现有模型难以平衡高层上下文特征和低层边缘特征的捕捉。

Method: 设计特征自适应空间定位模型(FASL-Seg)，包含低层特征投影流(LLFP)和高层特征投影流(HLFP)两个处理流，分别处理不同分辨率特征以实现精确分割。

Result: 在EndoVis18数据集上达到72.71%的mIoU（比SOTA提升5%），在EndoVis18和EndoVis17工具类型分割上分别达到85.61%和72.78%的mIoU，全面超越现有最佳性能。

Conclusion: 双流处理机制能有效处理不同分辨率特征，在解剖结构和手术器械分割方面都表现出色，证明了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: The growing popularity of robotic minimally invasive surgeries has made deep
learning-based surgical training a key area of research. A thorough
understanding of the surgical scene components is crucial, which semantic
segmentation models can help achieve. However, most existing work focuses on
surgical tools and overlooks anatomical objects. Additionally, current
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models struggle to balance capturing high-level
contextual features and low-level edge features. We propose a Feature-Adaptive
Spatial Localization model (FASL-Seg), designed to capture features at multiple
levels of detail through two distinct processing streams, namely a Low-Level
Feature Projection (LLFP) and a High-Level Feature Projection (HLFP) stream,
for varying feature resolutions - enabling precise segmentation of anatomy and
surgical instruments. We evaluated FASL-Seg on surgical segmentation benchmark
datasets EndoVis18 and EndoVis17 on three use cases. The FASL-Seg model
achieves a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 72.71% on parts and anatomy
segmentation in EndoVis18, improving on SOTA by 5%. It further achieves a mIoU
of 85.61% and 72.78% in EndoVis18 and EndoVis17 tool type segmentation,
respectively, outperforming SOTA overall performance, with comparable per-class
SOTA results in both datasets and consistent performance in various classes for
anatomy and instruments, demonstrating the effectiveness of distinct processing
streams for varying feature resolutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 母婴超声是监测胎儿发育的主要手段，但自动分割面临高质量注释稀缺的挑战。需要开发能够利用少量标签数据和大量无标签数据的半监督学习方法来提高分割性能。

Method: 使用轻量卷积网络(1.47M参数)和Transformer网络组合训练。通过标准监督使用标签数据，通过交叉监督使用无标签数据。引入信息散度损失（匀等KL散度和相互信息差距）来减少两个模型间的预测分歧。还应用mixup技术增强模型稳健性。

Result: 在两个胎儿超声数据集上，方法较七种最新半监督方法都更优。仅使用5%标签数据时，Dice指标提高2.39%，95%海士距离降低14.90，平均表面距离降低4.18。

Conclusion: 通过利用信息散度损失和半监督学习框架，成功实现了高效的注释节约型医学图像分割，为胎儿超声分割提供了稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Maternal-fetal Ultrasound is the primary modality for monitoring fetal
development, yet automated segmentation remains challenging due to the scarcity
of high-quality annotations. To address this limitation, we propose a
semi-supervised learning framework that leverages information divergence for
robust fetal ultrasound segmentation. Our method employs a lightweight
convolutional network (1.47M parameters) and a Transformer-based network,
trained jointly with labelled data through standard supervision and with
unlabelled data via cross-supervision. To encourage consistent and confident
predictions, we introduce an information divergence loss that combines
per-pixel Kullback-Leibler divergence and Mutual Information Gap, effectively
reducing prediction disagreement between the two models. In addition, we apply
mixup on unlabelled samples to further enhance robustness. Experiments on two
fetal ultrasound datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently
outperforms seven state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods. When only 5% of
training data is labelled, our framework improves the Dice score by 2.39%,
reduces the 95% Hausdorff distance by 14.90, and decreases the Average Surface
Distance by 4.18. These results highlight the effectiveness of leveraging
information divergence for annotation-efficient and robust medical image
segmentation. Our code is publicly available on GitHub.

heterogeneous data quality, and inconsistent labeling in dental diagnostic AI.
We compared FL with centralized (CL) and local learning (LL) for tooth
segmentation in panoramic radiographs across multiple data corruption
scenarios. Methods: An Attention U-Net was trained on 2066 radiographs from six
institutions across four settings: baseline (unaltered data); label
manipulation (dilated/missing annotations); image-quality manipulation
(additive Gaussian noise); and exclusion of a faulty client with corrupted
data. FL was implemented via the Flower AI framework. Per-client training- and
validation-loss trajectories were monitored for anomaly detection and a set of
metrics (Dice, IoU, HD, HD95 and ASSD) was evaluated on a hold-out test set.
From these metrics significance results were reported through Wilcoxon
signed-rank test. CL and LL served as comparators. Results: Baseline: FL
achieved a median Dice of 0.94889 (ASSD: 1.33229), slightly better than CL at
0.94706 (ASSD: 1.37074) and LL at 0.93557-0.94026 (ASSD: 1.51910-1.69777).
Label manipulation: FL maintained the best median Dice score at 0.94884 (ASSD:
1.46487) versus CL's 0.94183 (ASSD: 1.75738) and LL's 0.93003-0.94026 (ASSD:
1.51910-2.11462). Image noise: FL led with Dice at 0.94853 (ASSD: 1.31088); CL
scored 0.94787 (ASSD: 1.36131); LL ranged from 0.93179-0.94026 (ASSD:
1.51910-1.77350). Faulty-client exclusion: FL reached Dice at 0.94790 (ASSD:
1.33113) better than CL's 0.94550 (ASSD: 1.39318). Loss-curve monitoring
reliably flagged the corrupted site. Conclusions: FL matches or exceeds CL and
outperforms LL across corruption scenarios while preserving privacy. Per-client
loss trajectories provide an effective anomaly-detection mechanism and support
FL as a practical, privacy-preserving approach for scalable clinical AI
deployment.

Abstract: In subjective assessment of image and video quality, observers rate or
compare selected stimuli. Before calculating the mean opinion scores (MOS) for
these stimuli from the ratings, it is recommended to identify and deal with
outliers that may have given unreliable ratings. Several methods are available
for this purpose, some of which have been standardized. These methods are
typically based on statistics and sometimes tested by introducing synthetic
ratings from artificial outliers, such as random clickers. However, a reliable
and comprehensive approach is lacking for comparative performance analysis of
outlier detection methods. To fill this gap, this work proposes and applies an
empirical worst-case analysis as a general solution. Our method involves
evolutionary optimization of an adversarial black-box attack on outlier
detection algorithms, where the adversary maximizes the distortion of scale
values with respect to ground truth. We apply our analysis to several hard and
soft outlier detection methods for absolute category ratings and show their
differing performance in this stress test. In addition, we propose two new
outlier detection methods with low complexity and excellent worst-case
performance. Software for adversarial attacks and data analysis is available.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an invaluable tool for clinical and
research applications. Yet, variations in scanners and acquisition parameters
cause inconsistencies in image contrast, hindering data comparability and
reproducibility across datasets and clinical studies. Existing scanner
harmonization methods, designed to address this challenge, face limitations,
such as requiring traveling subjects or struggling to generalize to unseen
domains. We propose a novel approach using a conditioned diffusion autoencoder
with a contrastive loss and domain-agnostic contrast augmentation to harmonize
MR images across scanners while preserving subject-specific anatomy. Our method
enables brain MRI synthesis from a single reference image. It outperforms
baseline techniques, achieving a +7% PSNR improvement on a traveling subjects
dataset and +18% improvement on age regression in unseen. Our model provides
robust, effective harmonization of brain MRIs to target scanners without
requiring fine-tuning. This advancement promises to enhance comparability,
reproducibility, and generalizability in multi-site and longitudinal clinical
studies, ultimately contributing to improved healthcare outcomes.

TL;DR: MM-DINOv2是一个创新的多模态医学影像分析框架，通过多模态补丁嵌入和全模态掩码技术，将预训练的DINOv2视觉基础模型适配到多模态医疗影像任务中，解决了缺失模态和标注数据有限的问题。

Method: 提出MM-DINOv2框架，包含多模态补丁嵌入技术使模型能够处理多模态数据，采用全模态掩码技术学习跨模态鲁棒关系，并利用半监督学习充分利用大规模未标注数据集。

Conclusion: 该工作为多模态医学影像任务提供了一个可扩展且鲁棒的解决方案，能够有效利用自然图像预训练的视觉基础模型，同时解决临床实践中的缺失数据和有限标注等现实挑战。

Abstract: Vision foundation models like DINOv2 demonstrate remarkable potential in
medical imaging despite their origin in natural image domains. However, their
design inherently works best for uni-modal image analysis, limiting their
effectiveness for multi-modal imaging tasks that are common in many medical
fields, such as neurology and oncology. While supervised models perform well in
this setting, they fail to leverage unlabeled datasets and struggle with
missing modalities, a frequent challenge in clinical settings. To bridge these
gaps, we introduce MM-DINOv2, a novel and efficient framework that adapts the
pre-trained vision foundation model DINOv2 for multi-modal medical imaging. Our
approach incorporates multi-modal patch embeddings, enabling vision foundation
models to effectively process multi-modal imaging data. To address missing
modalities, we employ full-modality masking, which encourages the model to
learn robust cross-modality relationships. Furthermore, we leverage
semi-supervised learning to harness large unlabeled datasets, enhancing both
the accuracy and reliability of medical predictions. Applied to glioma subtype
classification from multi-sequence brain MRI, our method achieves a Matthews
Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.6 on an external test set, surpassing
state-of-the-art supervised approaches by +11.1%. Our work establishes a
scalable and robust solution for multi-modal medical imaging tasks, leveraging
powerful vision foundation models pre-trained on natural images while
addressing real-world clinical challenges such as missing data and limited
annotations.

Abstract: Reducing the triangle count in complex 3D models is a basic geometry
preprocessing step in graphics pipelines such as efficient rendering and
interactive editing. However, most existing mesh simplification methods exhibit
a few issues. Firstly, they often lead to self-intersections during decimation,
a major issue for applications such as 3D printing and soft-body simulation.
Second, to perform simplification on a mesh in the wild, one would first need
to perform re-meshing, which often suffers from surface shifts and losses of
sharp features. Finally, existing re-meshing and simplification methods can
take minutes when processing large-scale meshes, limiting their applications in
practice. To address the challenges, we introduce a novel GPU-based mesh
optimization approach containing three key components: (1) a parallel
re-meshing algorithm to turn meshes in the wild into watertight, manifold, and
intersection-free ones, and reduce the prevalence of poorly shaped triangles;
(2) a robust parallel simplification algorithm with intersection-free
guarantees; (3) an optimization-based safe projection algorithm to realign the
simplified mesh with the input, eliminating the surface shift introduced by
re-meshing and recovering the original sharp features. The algorithm
demonstrates remarkable efficiency, simplifying a 2-million-face mesh to 20k
triangles in 3 seconds on RTX4090. We evaluated the approach on the Thingi10K
dataset and showcased its exceptional performance in geometry preservation and
speed.

Abstract: Each element in tensioned structural networks -- such as tensegrity,
architectural fabrics, or medical braces/meshes -- requires a specific tension
level to achieve and maintain the desired shape, stability, and compliance.
These structures are challenging to manufacture, 3D print, or assemble because
flattening the network during fabrication introduces multiplicative
inaccuracies in the network's final tension gradients. This study overcomes
this challenge by offering a fabrication algorithm for direct 3D printing of
such networks with programmed tension gradients, an approach analogous to the
spinning of spiderwebs. The algorithm: (i) defines the desired network and
prescribes its tension gradients using the force density method; (ii) converts
the network into an unstretched counterpart by numerically optimizing vertex
locations toward target element lengths and converting straight elements into
arcs to resolve any remaining error; and (iii) decomposes the network into
printable toolpaths; Optional additional steps are: (iv) flattening curved 2D
networks or 3D networks to ensure 3D printing compatibility; and (v)
automatically resolving any unwanted crossings introduced by the flattening
process. The proposed method is experimentally validated using 2D unit cells of
viscoelastic filaments, where accurate tension gradients are achieved with an
average element strain error of less than 1.0\%. The method remains effective
for networks with element minimum length and maximum stress of 5.8 mm and 7.3
MPa, respectively. The method is used to demonstrate the fabrication of three
complex cases: a flat spiderweb, a curved mesh, and a tensegrity system. The
programmable tension gradient algorithm can be utilized to produce compact,
integrated cable networks, enabling novel applications such as moment-exerting
structures in medical braces and splints.

Conclusion: 混合方法有效解决了手绘角色动画中几何一致性与动态表现之间的平衡问题，为复杂非刚性元素的自然动画提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Hand-drawn character animation is a vibrant field in computer graphics,
presenting challenges in achieving geometric consistency while conveying
expressive motion. Traditional skeletal animation methods maintain geometric
consistency but struggle with complex non-rigid elements like flowing hair and
skirts, leading to unnatural deformation. Conversely, video diffusion models
synthesize realistic dynamics but often create geometric distortions in
stylized drawings due to domain gaps. This work proposes a hybrid animation
system that combines skeletal animation and video diffusion. Initially, coarse
images are generated from characters retargeted with skeletal animations for
geometric guidance. These images are then enhanced in texture and secondary
dynamics using video diffusion priors, framing this enhancement as an
inpainting task. A domain-adapted diffusion model refines user-masked regions
needing improvement, especially for secondary dynamics. To enhance motion
realism further, we introduce a Secondary Dynamics Injection (SDI) strategy in
the denoising process, incorporating features from a pre-trained diffusion
model enriched with human motion priors. Additionally, to tackle unnatural
deformations from low-poly single-mesh character modeling, we present a Hair
Layering Modeling (HLM) technique that uses segmentation maps to separate hair
from the body, allowing for more natural animation of long-haired characters.
Extensive experiments show that our system outperforms state-of-the-art methods
in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

TL;DR: SKEL是一个新的参数化人体模型，通过将SMPL模型重新绑定到生物力学准确的骨骼结构上，解决了现有模型在生物力学准确性方面的局限性。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的人体模型（如SMPL）具有简化的运动学结构，与真实人体骨骼系统的关节位置和关节结构不符，限制了其在生物力学中的应用。需要开发一个具有生物力学准确骨骼结构且易于摆姿的参数化3D人体模型。

Method: 1) 通过优化AMASS序列中的SMPL网格内的生物力学准确骨骼来构建数据集；2) 学习从SMPL网格顶点到优化关节位置和骨骼旋转的回归器；3) 用新的运动学参数重新参数化SMPL网格。

Conclusion: SKEL提供了一个新工具，实现了"野外生物力学"，同时为视觉和图形研究人员提供了更好约束和更真实的人体关节模型。

Abstract: Great progress has been made in estimating 3D human pose and shape from
images and video by training neural networks to directly regress the parameters
of parametric human models like SMPL. However, existing body models have
simplified kinematic structures that do not correspond to the true joint
locations and articulations in the human skeletal system, limiting their
potential use in biomechanics. On the other hand, methods for estimating
biomechanically accurate skeletal motion typically rely on complex motion
capture systems and expensive optimization methods. What is needed is a
parametric 3D human model with a biomechanically accurate skeletal structure
that can be easily posed. To that end, we develop SKEL, which re-rigs the SMPL
body model with a biomechanics skeleton. To enable this, we need training data
of skeletons inside SMPL meshes in diverse poses.
  We build such a dataset by optimizing biomechanically accurate skeletons
inside SMPL meshes from AMASS sequences. We then learn a regressor from SMPL
mesh vertices to the optimized joint locations and bone rotations. Finally, we
re-parametrize the SMPL mesh with the new kinematic parameters. The resulting
SKEL model is animatable like SMPL but with fewer, and
biomechanically-realistic, degrees of freedom. We show that SKEL has more
biomechanically accurate joint locations than SMPL, and the bones fit inside
the body surface better than previous methods. By fitting SKEL to SMPL meshes
we are able to "upgrade" existing human pose and shape datasets to include
biomechanical parameters. SKEL provides a new tool to enable biomechanics in
the wild, while also providing vision and graphics researchers with a better
constrained and more realistic model of human articulation. The model, code,
and data are available for research at https://skel.is.tue.mpg.de..

Abstract: Large transformer-based models have made significant progress in
generalizable novel view synthesis (NVS) from sparse input views, generating
novel viewpoints without the need for test-time optimization. However, these
models are constrained by the limited diversity of publicly available scene
datasets, making most real-world (in-the-wild) scenes out-of-distribution. To
overcome this, we incorporate synthetic training data generated from diffusion
models, which improves generalization across unseen domains. While synthetic
data offers scalability, we identify artifacts introduced during data
generation as a key bottleneck affecting reconstruction quality. To address
this, we propose a token disentanglement process within the transformer
architecture, enhancing feature separation and ensuring more effective
learning. This refinement not only improves reconstruction quality over
standard transformers but also enables scalable training with synthetic data.
As a result, our method outperforms existing models on both in-dataset and
cross-dataset evaluations, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple
benchmarks while significantly reducing computational costs. Project page:

Abstract: This paper presents a level-set based structural approach for the joint
inversion of full-waveform and gravity data. The joint inversion aims to
integrate the strengths of full-waveform inversion for high resolution imaging
and gravity inversion for detecting density contrasts over extensive regions.
Although common studies typically only observe full-waveform inversion
assisting gravity inversion, we propose three key points that enable gravity
data to complement full-waveform data in the joint inversion. (i) Based on the
well-posedness theorem, we consider a volume mass distribution where the
density-contrast value is imposed as a priori information, ensuring that the
gravity data provide meaningful information. (ii) We utilize a level-set
formulation to characterize the shared interface of wave velocity and density
functions, connecting multi-physics datasets via the structural similarity of
their inversion parameters. (iii) We develop a balanced and decaying weight to
regulate the influence of multi-physics datasets during joint inversion. This
weight comprises a balanced part that accounts for the differing scales of
full-waveform and gravity data, and a decaying part designed to effectively
utilize the features and advantages of each dataset.

Abstract: Solar energy adoption is critical to achieving net-zero emissions. However,
it remains difficult for many industrial and commercial actors to decide on
whether they should adopt distributed solar-battery systems, which is largely
due to the unavailability of fast, low-cost, and high-resolution irradiance
forecasts. Here, we present SunCastNet, a lightweight data-driven forecasting
system that provides 0.05$^\circ$, 10-minute resolution predictions of surface
solar radiation downwards (SSRD) up to 7 days ahead. SunCastNet, coupled with
reinforcement learning (RL) for battery scheduling, reduces operational regret
by 76--93\% compared to robust decision making (RDM). In 25-year investment
backtests, it enables up to five of ten high-emitting industrial sectors per
region to cross the commercial viability threshold of 12\% Internal Rate of
Return (IRR). These results show that high-resolution, long-horizon solar
forecasts can directly translate into measurable economic gains, supporting
near-optimal energy operations and accelerating renewable deployment.

Abstract: We introduce LocoMamba, a vision-driven cross-modal DRL framework built on
selective state-space models, specifically leveraging Mamba, that achieves
near-linear-time sequence modeling, effectively captures long-range
dependencies, and enables efficient training with longer sequences. First, we
embed proprioceptive states with a multilayer perceptron and patchify depth
images with a lightweight convolutional neural network, producing compact
tokens that improve state representation. Second, stacked Mamba layers fuse
these tokens via near-linear-time selective scanning, reducing latency and
memory footprint, remaining robust to token length and image resolution, and
providing an inductive bias that mitigates overfitting. Third, we train the
policy end-to-end with Proximal Policy Optimization under terrain and
appearance randomization and an obstacle-density curriculum, using a compact
state-centric reward that balances progress, smoothness, and safety. We
evaluate our method in challenging simulated environments with static and
moving obstacles as well as uneven terrain. Compared with state-of-the-art
baselines, our method achieves higher returns and success rates with fewer
collisions, exhibits stronger generalization to unseen terrains and obstacle
densities, and improves training efficiency by converging in fewer updates

trajectories, which inherently face issues with 3D spatial ambiguity. In this
work, we present a novel framework named ManipDreamer3D for generating
plausible 3D-aware robotic manipulation videos from the input image and the
text instruction. Our method combines 3D trajectory planning with a
reconstructed 3D occupancy map created from a third-person perspective, along
with a novel trajectory-to-video diffusion model. Specifically, ManipDreamer3D
first reconstructs the 3D occupancy representation from the input image and
then computes an optimized 3D end-effector trajectory, minimizing path length
while avoiding collisions. Next, we employ a latent editing technique to create
video sequences from the initial image latent and the optimized 3D trajectory.
This process conditions our specially trained trajectory-to-video diffusion
model to produce robotic pick-and-place videos. Our method generates robotic
videos with autonomously planned plausible 3D trajectories, significantly
reducing human intervention requirements. Experimental results demonstrate
superior visual quality compared to existing methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对LLMs在自动驾驶中的评估主要局限于合成数据集或缺乏真实性能对比的手动驾驶数据集，无法准确反映LLMs在真实边缘案例中的表现，而这些案例正是当前自动驾驶系统容易失败的地方。

Method: 采用开放词汇目标检测器结合提示工程和大型语言模型上下文推理的架构，在真实边缘案例上测试多个最先进模型。

Result: 提供了定性比较结果，展示了LLMs在真实边缘案例中的表现，并讨论了相关发现。

Conclusion: LLMs有潜力作为自动驾驶车辆中的异常检测器，但需要进一步研究和改进以适应真实世界的复杂场景。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has pushed their
boundaries to many applications in various domains. Recently, the research
community has started to evaluate their potential adoption in autonomous
vehicles and especially as complementary modules in the perception and planning
software stacks. However, their evaluation is limited in synthetic datasets or
manually driving datasets without the ground truth knowledge and more
precisely, how the current perception and planning algorithms would perform in
the cases under evaluation. For this reason, this work evaluates LLMs on
real-world edge cases where current autonomous vehicles have been proven to
fail. The proposed architecture consists of an open vocabulary object detector
coupled with prompt engineering and large language model contextual reasoning.
We evaluate several state-of-the-art models against real edge cases and provide
qualitative comparison results along with a discussion on the findings for the
potential application of LLMs as anomaly detectors in autonomous vehicles.

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: 提出混合照明复用傅里叶叠层成像显微镜（HMFPM），通过混合照明策略和定制重建算法，在减少测量次数的同时实现稳健的像差校正和稳定收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统FPM需要顺序测量导致数据采集慢，现有复用策略需要精细参数调谐且缺乏有效像差校正，容易导致图像质量下降。

Method: 采用混合照明策略和定制重建算法，结合解析和优化方法，集成解析像差提取能力与复用照明效率。

Result: 实现1.08微米分辨率（比系统相干衍射极限提高4倍），在1.77x1.77毫米视场内仅需20次测量，具有84微米数字重聚焦能力，能有效校正全场和扫描引起的像差。

Conclusion: HMFPM为生物医学成像提供了一种实用、高通量且无像差的解决方案。

Abstract: Fourier ptychographic microscopy (FPM) is a powerful computational imaging
modality that achieves high space-bandwidth product imaging for biomedical
samples. However, its adoption is limited by slow data acquisition due to the
need for sequential measurements. Multiplexed FPM strategies have been proposed
to accelerate imaging by activating multiple LEDs simultaneously, but they
typically require careful parameter tuning, and their lack of effective
aberration correction makes them prone to image degradation. To address these
limitations, we introduce hybrid-illumination multiplexed Fourier ptychographic
microscopy (HMFPM), which integrates analytic aberration extraction capability
with the efficiency of multiplexed illumination. Specifically, HMFPM employs a
hybrid illumination strategy and a customized reconstruction algorithm with
analytic and optimization methods. This hybrid strategy substantially reduces
the number of required measurements while ensuring robust aberration correction
and stable convergence. We demonstrate that HMFPM achieves 1.08 micrometers
resolution, representing a 4-fold enhancement over the system's coherent
diffraction limit, across a 1.77x1.77 millimeter square field of view using 20
measurements. HMFPM remains robust under diverse aberrations, providing up to
84 micrometers digital refocusing capability, and effectively corrects both
field-dependent and scanning-induced aberrations in whole-slide pathology
imaging. These results establish HMFPM as a practical, high-throughput, and
aberration-free solution for biological and biomedical imaging.

TL;DR: 开发了一种基于条纹投影的在线监测系统，用于激光定向能量沉积过程中的表面重建和缺陷检测，实现了±46μm的精度和自动化的缺陷识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 定向能量沉积(DED)工艺容易产生几何偏差、未熔合和表面粗糙等缺陷，需要有效的在线监测方法来提高制造质量。

Method: 采用构建高度同步的条纹投影系统进行逐层表面重建，并提出了局部点密度和法向变化率两种几何点云指标来自动识别表面缺陷。

Result: 实现了±46μm的重建精度，能够自动识别表面粗糙和未熔合缺陷，无需人工标注即可实现沉积异常的自动化检测。

Conclusion: 该工作将条纹投影确立为DED工艺中微米级监测的实用工具，通过直接关联几何偏差与缺陷形成，为可认证的增材制造提供了闭环过程控制的可能性。

Abstract: Directed energy deposition (DED), a metal additive manufacturing process, is
highly susceptible to process-induced defects such as geometric deviations,
lack of fusion, and poor surface finish. This work presents a
build-height-synchronized fringe projection system for in-situ, layer-wise
surface reconstruction of laser-DED components, achieving a reconstruction
accuracy of ${\pm}$46 ${\mu}$m. From the reconstructed 3D morphology, two
complementary geometry-based point cloud metrics are introduced: local point
density, which highlights poor surface finish, and normal-change rate, which
identifies lack-of-fusion features. These methods enable automated,
annotation-free identification of common deposition anomalies directly from
reconstructed surfaces, without the need for manual labeling. By directly
linking geometric deviation to defect formation, the approach enables precise
anomaly localization and advances the feasibility of closed-loop process
control. This work establishes fringe projection as a practical tool for
micrometer-scale monitoring in DED, bridging the gap between process signatures
and part geometry for certifiable additive manufacturing.

Abstract: Realistic visual renderings of street-design scenarios are essential for
public engagement in active transportation planning. Traditional approaches are
labor-intensive, hindering collective deliberation and collaborative
decision-making. While AI-assisted generative design shows transformative
potential by enabling rapid creation of design scenarios, existing generative
approaches typically require large amounts of domain-specific training data and
struggle to enable precise spatial variations of design/configuration in
complex street-view scenes. We introduce a multi-agent system that edits and
redesigns bicycle facilities directly on real-world street-view imagery. The
framework integrates lane localization, prompt optimization, design generation,
and automated evaluation to synthesize realistic, contextually appropriate
designs. Experiments across diverse urban scenarios demonstrate that the system
can adapt to varying road geometries and environmental conditions, consistently
yielding visually coherent and instruction-compliant results. This work
establishes a foundation for applying multi-agent pipelines to transportation
infrastructure planning and facility design.

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了旋转球壳中热对流的线性启动，重点分析了机械边界条件和热驱动方式的影响。发现外边界在厚壳层或高Pr数时变得不稳定，无滑移边界条件下雷努数更低，内部加热会提高雷努数并改变对流特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旋转球壳中热对流启动的机制，以了解边界条件和热驱动方式如何影响对流的形成和特征，为行星和恒星内部模型提供理论基础。

Method: 使用谱方法计算了广泛参数范围内的临界雷努数、方位角波数和振荡频率，包括不同普朗司特数、壳层幅比和中等埃克曼数。比较了无滑移和应力自由边界条件，以及差分加热与内部加热方式。

Result: 发现外边界在厚壳层或高Pr数时会变得不稳定，导致无滑移边界条件下的临界雷努数低于应力自由边界。内部加热会提高临界雷努数，使得对流在更大波数和频率下启动，并将关键区域移离切线缸。混合边界条件下行为类似应力自由边界，说明外边界占主导地位。

Conclusion: 边界条件和加热机制在控制热对流启动中起着关键作用，在建立行星和恒星内部模型时应详细考虑这些因素。外边界的特别重要性强调了在实际应用中准确设置边界条件的必要性。

Abstract: We investigate the linear onset of thermal convection in rotating spherical
shells with a focus on the influence of mechanical boundary conditions and
thermal driving modes. Using a spectral method, we determine critical Rayleigh
numbers, azimuthal wavenumbers, and oscillation frequencies over a wide range
of Prandtl numbers and shell aspect ratios at moderate Ekman numbers. We show
that the preferred boundary condition for convective onset depends
systematically on both aspect ratio and Prandtl number: for sufficiently thick
shells or for large $\text{Pr}$, the Ekman boundary layer at the outer boundary
becomes destabilising, so that no-slip boundaries yield a lower $\text{Ra}_c$
than stress-free boundaries. Comparing differential and internal heating, we
find that internal heating generally raises $\text{Ra}_c$, shifts the onset to
larger wavenumbers and frequencies, and relocates the critical column away from
the tangent cylinder. Mixed boundary conditions with no-slip on the inner
boundary behave similarly to purely stress-free boundaries, confirming the
dominant influence of the outer surface. These results demonstrate that
boundary conditions and heating mechanisms play a central role in controlling
the onset of convection and should be carefully considered in models of
planetary and stellar interiors.

Conclusion: 语言对齐模型的集成显著提升了SELD性能，未来将深入研究模态特定贡献和结构优化

Abstract: In this study, we address the multimodal task of stereo sound event
localization and detection with source distance estimation (3D SELD) in regular
video content. 3D SELD is a complex task that combines temporal event
classification with spatial localization, requiring reasoning across spatial,
temporal, and semantic dimensions. The last is arguably the most challenging to
model. Traditional SELD approaches typically rely on multichannel input,
limiting their capacity to benefit from large-scale pre-training due to data
constraints. To overcome this, we enhance a standard SELD architecture with
semantic information by integrating pre-trained, contrastive language-aligned
models: CLAP for audio and OWL-ViT for visual inputs. These embeddings are
incorporated into a modified Conformer module tailored for multimodal fusion,
which we refer to as the Cross-Modal Conformer. We perform an ablation study on
the development set of the DCASE2025 Task3 Stereo SELD Dataset to assess the
individual contributions of the language-aligned models and benchmark against
the DCASE Task 3 baseline systems. Additionally, we detail the curation process
of large synthetic audio and audio-visual datasets used for model pre-training.
These datasets were further expanded through left-right channel swapping
augmentation. Our approach, combining extensive pre-training, model ensembling,
and visual post-processing, achieved second rank in the DCASE 2025 Challenge
Task 3 (Track B), underscoring the effectiveness of our method. Future work
will explore the modality-specific contributions and architectural refinements.

Result: 融合潜在表示能产生更结构化的模式，而单独表示在特定情况下仍然有用

Conclusion: 融合潜在数据表示在城市数据分析中通常更有效，但单独表示在某些特定场景下仍有价值

Abstract: Urban analytics utilizes extensive datasets with diverse urban information to
simulate, predict trends, and uncover complex patterns within cities. While
these data enables advanced analysis, it also presents challenges due to its
granularity, heterogeneity, and multimodality. To address these challenges,
visual analytics tools have been developed to support the exploration of latent
representations of fused heterogeneous and multimodal data, discretized at a
street-level of detail. However, visualization-assisted tools seldom explore
the extent to which fused data can offer deeper insights than examining each
data source independently within an integrated visualization framework. In this
work, we developed a visualization-assisted framework to analyze whether fused
latent data representations are more effective than separate representations in
uncovering patterns from dynamic and static urban data. The analysis reveals
that combined latent representations produce more structured patterns, while
separate ones are useful in particular cases.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的正则化方法，通过在函数空间中约束微调模型与预训练模型的距离，并使用模拟OOD样本来保持预训练模型的OOD鲁棒性，同时引入一致性正则化来增强微调模型的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的鲁棒微调方法（如保留预训练权重、特征或logits）不能始终提高不同模型架构的OOD鲁棒性，因为这些方法不能很好地代理函数空间中的优化。

Method: 提出函数空间距离约束正则化，使用模拟OOD样本来保持预训练模型的OOD鲁棒性；引入一致性正则化来促进扰动样本的稳定预测。

Result: 在多种CLIP骨干网络上，该方法能够一致地提高下游任务的ID微调性能和OOD鲁棒性，优于现有的基于正则化的鲁棒微调方法。

Conclusion: 通过在函数空间中直接约束模型距离并使用一致性正则化，能够有效保持预训练模型的OOD鲁棒性，同时获得良好的下游任务性能。

Abstract: Robust fine-tuning aims to achieve competitive in-distribution (ID)
performance while maintaining the out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness of a
pre-trained model when transferring it to a downstream task. To remedy this,
most robust fine-tuning methods aim to preserve the pretrained weights,
features, or logits. However, we find that these methods cannot always improve
OOD robustness for different model architectures. This is due to the OOD
robustness requiring the model function to produce stable prediction for input
information of downstream tasks, while existing methods might serve as a poor
proxy for the optimization in the function space. Based on this finding, we
propose a novel regularization that constrains the distance of fine-tuning and
pre-trained model in the function space with the simulated OOD samples, aiming
to preserve the OOD robustness of the pre-trained model. Besides, to further
enhance the OOD robustness capability of the fine-tuning model, we introduce an
additional consistency regularization to promote stable predictions of
perturbed samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate our approach could
consistently improve both downstream task ID fine-tuning performance and OOD
robustness across a variety of CLIP backbones, outperforming existing
regularization-based robust fine-tuning methods.

TL;DR: ProfilingAgent是一个基于LLM的多智能体系统，通过分析静态指标和动态性能信号来自动化模型压缩（剪枝和量化），在保持精度的同时显著减少内存使用和提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型在资源受限平台上面临计算和内存瓶颈，现有压缩技术大多使用统一启发式方法，忽略了架构和运行时异质性，需要更智能的自动化压缩方案。

Method: 使用大型语言模型构建模块化多智能体系统，分析静态指标（MACs、参数量）和动态信号（延迟、内存）来设计特定架构的压缩策略，包括结构化剪枝和训练后动态量化。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型上测试显示：剪枝保持或提升精度（ImageNet-1K精度下降约1%，ViT-B/16在小数据集上提升2%），量化实现高达74%内存节省和<0.5%精度损失，推理速度提升达1.74倍。

Conclusion: 智能体系统可作为可扩展的配置文件引导模型优化解决方案，LLM推理质量对迭代剪枝过程至关重要。

Abstract: Foundation models face growing compute and memory bottlenecks, hindering
deployment on resource-limited platforms. While compression techniques such as
pruning and quantization are widely used, most rely on uniform heuristics that
ignore architectural and runtime heterogeneity. Profiling tools expose
per-layer latency, memory, and compute cost, yet are rarely integrated into
automated pipelines. We propose ProfilingAgent, a profiling-guided, agentic
approach that uses large language models (LLMs) to automate compression via
structured pruning and post-training dynamic quantization. Our modular
multi-agent system reasons over static metrics (MACs, parameter counts) and
dynamic signals (latency, memory) to design architecture-specific strategies.
Unlike heuristic baselines, ProfilingAgent tailors layer-wise decisions to
bottlenecks. Experiments on ImageNet-1K, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 with
ResNet-101, ViT-B/16, Swin-B, and DeiT-B/16 show pruning maintains competitive
or improved accuracy (about 1% drop on ImageNet-1K, +2% gains for ViT-B/16 on
smaller datasets), while quantization achieves up to 74% memory savings with
<0.5% accuracy loss. Our quantization also yields consistent inference speedups
of up to 1.74 times faster. Comparative studies with GPT-4o and GPT-4-Turbo
highlight the importance of LLM reasoning quality for iterative pruning. These
results establish agentic systems as scalable solutions for profiling-guided
model optimization.
