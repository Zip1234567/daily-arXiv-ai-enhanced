### [1] [Heatmap Regression without Soft-Argmax for Facial Landmark Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14929)
*Chiao-An Yang,Raymond A. Yeh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文挑战了面部关键点检测中广泛使用的Soft-argmax方法，提出了基于结构化预测框架的替代训练目标，在多个基准测试中实现了最先进性能，训练收敛速度提升2.2倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 热图回归方法在面部关键点检测中广泛使用，但argmax操作不可微分，传统使用Soft-argmax作为近似。作者认为这不是唯一的选择，需要探索替代方案。

Method: 提出基于经典结构化预测框架的训练目标，替代传统的Soft-argmax方法，实现端到端训练。

Result: 在WFLW、COFW和300W三个面部关键点基准测试中达到最先进性能，训练收敛速度提升2.2倍，同时保持更好/竞争性的准确率。

Conclusion: Soft-argmax不是实现高性能面部关键点检测的唯一方法，结构化预测框架提供了有效的替代方案，具有更快的收敛速度和竞争性的性能表现。

Abstract: Facial landmark detection is an important task in computer vision with
numerous applications, such as head pose estimation, expression analysis, face
swapping, etc. Heatmap regression-based methods have been widely used to
achieve state-of-the-art results in this task. These methods involve computing
the argmax over the heatmaps to predict a landmark. Since argmax is not
differentiable, these methods use a differentiable approximation, Soft-argmax,
to enable end-to-end training on deep-nets. In this work, we revisit this
long-standing choice of using Soft-argmax and demonstrate that it is not the
only way to achieve strong performance. Instead, we propose an alternative
training objective based on the classic structured prediction framework.
Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three facial
landmark benchmarks (WFLW, COFW, and 300W), converging 2.2x faster during
training while maintaining better/competitive accuracy. Our code is available
here: https://github.com/ca-joe-yang/regression-without-softarg.

### [2] [Fast Graph Neural Network for Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14958)
*Mustafa Mohammadi Gharasuie,Luis Rueda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种将图卷积网络(GCN)与Voronoi图相结合的新方法，通过将图像表示为图结构并利用Delaunay三角剖分进行优化，显著提升了图像分类的预处理效率和分类精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统卷积神经网络在处理复杂数据结构时存在局限性，而图卷积网络能够更好地建模关系数据。本研究旨在通过结合GCN和Voronoi图来提升图像分类性能，特别是在复杂场景和细粒度分类任务中。

Method: 将图像表示为图结构（像素或区域作为顶点），使用对应的Delaunay三角剖分优化图表示，然后应用图卷积网络进行分类。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上实现了显著的预处理效率提升和分类准确率提高，超越了最先进的方法，特别是在复杂场景和细粒度分类任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: GCN与Voronoi图的结合为图像分类提供了新的视角，扩展了基于图的学习范式在计算机视觉和非结构化数据分析中的应用潜力。

Abstract: The rapid progress in image classification has been largely driven by the
adoption of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), which offer a robust framework
for handling complex data structures. This study introduces a novel approach
that integrates GCNs with Voronoi diagrams to enhance image classification by
leveraging their ability to effectively model relational data. Unlike
conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), our method represents images
as graphs, where pixels or regions function as vertices. These graphs are then
refined using corresponding Delaunay triangulations, optimizing their
representation. The proposed model achieves significant improvements in both
preprocessing efficiency and classification accuracy across various benchmark
datasets, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in challenging
scenarios involving intricate scenes and fine-grained categories. Experimental
results, validated through cross-validation, underscore the effectiveness of
combining GCNs with Voronoi diagrams for advancing image classification. This
research not only presents a novel perspective on image classification but also
expands the potential applications of graph-based learning paradigms in
computer vision and unstructured data analysis.

### [3] [You Only Pose Once: A Minimalist's Detection Transformer for Monocular RGB Category-level 9D Multi-Object Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14965)
*Hakjin Lee,Junghoon Seo,Jaehoon Sim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: YOPO是一个单阶段的RGB-only框架，将目标检测和9自由度姿态估计统一起来，无需额外数据，在三个基准测试中达到新的最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖伪深度、CAD模型或多阶段级联，需要更简单的RGB-only解决方案来直接从类别级别学习，统一目标检测和9自由度姿态估计。

Method: 基于transformer检测器的单阶段查询框架，增加轻量级姿态头、边界框条件平移模块和6D感知匈牙利匹配成本，仅使用RGB图像和类别级姿态标签进行端到端训练。

Result: 在REAL275数据集上达到79.6% IoU50和54.1%的10°10cm指标，超越之前的RGB-only方法，缩小了与RGB-D系统的差距。

Conclusion: YOPO证明了目标检测和9自由度姿态估计可以高性能地统一，无需额外数据，为机器人学和自动化提供了更简洁有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurately recovering the full 9-DoF pose of unseen instances within specific
categories from a single RGB image remains a core challenge for robotics and
automation. Most existing solutions still rely on pseudo-depth, CAD models, or
multi-stage cascades that separate 2D detection from pose estimation. Motivated
by the need for a simpler, RGB-only alternative that learns directly at the
category level, we revisit a longstanding question: Can object detection and
9-DoF pose estimation be unified with high performance, without any additional
data? We show that they can with our method, YOPO, a single-stage, query-based
framework that treats category-level 9-DoF estimation as a natural extension of
2D detection. YOPO augments a transformer detector with a lightweight pose
head, a bounding-box-conditioned translation module, and a 6D-aware Hungarian
matching cost. The model is trained end-to-end only with RGB images and
category-level pose labels. Despite its minimalist design, YOPO sets a new
state of the art on three benchmarks. On the REAL275 dataset, it achieves 79.6%
$\rm{IoU}_{50}$ and 54.1% under the $10^\circ$$10{\rm{cm}}$ metric, surpassing
prior RGB-only methods and closing much of the gap to RGB-D systems. The code,
models, and additional qualitative results can be found on our project.

### [4] [Paired-Sampling Contrastive Framework for Joint Physical-Digital Face Attack Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14980)
*Andrei Balykin,Anvar Ganiev,Denis Kondranin,Kirill Polevoda,Nikolai Liudkevich,Artem Petrov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的物理-数字攻击检测框架，通过配对采样对比学习来自动匹配真实和攻击自拍对，学习模态无关的活体特征，在Face Anti-Spoofing挑战赛上达到2.10%的错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统人脸识别系统使用独立模型分别处理物理呈现攻击和数字伪造攻击，这增加了系统复杂度、推理延迟，并且容易受到组合攻击向量的威胁。

Method: 提出了配对采样对比框架（Paired-Sampling Contrastive Framework），利用自动匹配的真实和攻击自拍对来学习模态无关的活体线索，实现统一的训练方法。

Result: 在第6届Face Anti-Spoofing挑战赛的统一物理-数字攻击检测基准上，平均分类错误率（ACER）达到2.10%，优于现有解决方案，且模型轻量（4.46 GFLOPs），训练时间不到1小时。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种实用且高效的统一解决方案，能够同时防御物理和数字攻击，适合实际部署应用。

Abstract: Modern face recognition systems remain vulnerable to spoofing attempts,
including both physical presentation attacks and digital forgeries.
Traditionally, these two attack vectors have been handled by separate models,
each targeting its own artifacts and modalities. However, maintaining distinct
detectors increases system complexity and inference latency and leaves systems
exposed to combined attack vectors. We propose the Paired-Sampling Contrastive
Framework, a unified training approach that leverages automatically matched
pairs of genuine and attack selfies to learn modality-agnostic liveness cues.
Evaluated on the 6th Face Anti-Spoofing Challenge Unified Physical-Digital
Attack Detection benchmark, our method achieves an average classification error
rate (ACER) of 2.10 percent, outperforming prior solutions. The framework is
lightweight (4.46 GFLOPs) and trains in under one hour, making it practical for
real-world deployment. Code and pretrained models are available at

### [5] [TAIGen: Training-Free Adversarial Image Generation via Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15020)
*Susim Roy,Anubhooti Jain,Mayank Vatsa,Richa Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TAIGen是一种无需训练的黑盒对抗图像生成方法，通过仅需3-20个采样步骤从无条件扩散模型中高效生成高质量对抗样本，攻击成功率高且计算速度快。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成模型的对抗攻击往往产生低质量图像且需要大量计算资源，扩散模型虽然能生成高质量图像但通常需要数百个采样步骤，因此需要开发更高效的对抗生成方法。

Method: 提出TAIGen方法：1）在混合步骤区间注入扰动，无需处理所有时间步；2）采用选择性RGB通道策略，对红色通道应用注意力图，对绿色和蓝色通道使用GradCAM引导的扰动；3）保持图像结构的同时最大化目标模型的误分类。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上，以VGGNet为源模型，对ResNet攻击成功率达70.6%，对MNASNet达80.8%，对ShuffleNet达97.8%；PSNR超过30dB保持视觉质量；生成速度比现有扩散攻击快10倍；获得最低的鲁棒准确率。

Conclusion: TAIGen是一种高效且有效的对抗图像生成方法，能够在保持高质量的同时实现高攻击成功率，且计算效率显著优于现有方法，防御机制对其生成的图像净化效果最差。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks from generative models often produce low-quality images
and require substantial computational resources. Diffusion models, though
capable of high-quality generation, typically need hundreds of sampling steps
for adversarial generation. This paper introduces TAIGen, a training-free
black-box method for efficient adversarial image generation. TAIGen produces
adversarial examples using only 3-20 sampling steps from unconditional
diffusion models. Our key finding is that perturbations injected during the
mixing step interval achieve comparable attack effectiveness without processing
all timesteps. We develop a selective RGB channel strategy that applies
attention maps to the red channel while using GradCAM-guided perturbations on
green and blue channels. This design preserves image structure while maximizing
misclassification in target models. TAIGen maintains visual quality with PSNR
above 30 dB across all tested datasets. On ImageNet with VGGNet as source,
TAIGen achieves 70.6% success against ResNet, 80.8% against MNASNet, and 97.8%
against ShuffleNet. The method generates adversarial examples 10x faster than
existing diffusion-based attacks. Our method achieves the lowest robust
accuracy, indicating it is the most impactful attack as the defense mechanism
is least successful in purifying the images generated by TAIGen.

### [6] [Reversible Unfolding Network for Concealed Visual Perception with Generative Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15027)
*Chunming He,Fengyang Xiao,Rihan Zhang,Chengyu Fang,Deng-Ping Fan,Sina Farsiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RUN++是一个可逆展开网络，通过生成式细化解决隐蔽视觉感知问题，在mask和RGB双域应用可逆建模，并利用扩散模型处理不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CVP方法主要局限于mask域，未能充分利用RGB域的潜力，且在处理不确定性方面存在局限。

Method: 将CVP任务建模为数学优化问题，展开为多阶段深度网络，包含CORE、CARE和FINE三个模块，分别处理mask域、RGB域和最终细化。

Result: 提出的方法能够有效减少假阳性和假阴性，在真实世界退化条件下保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RUN++通过可逆展开网络和生成式细化的协同作用，为构建鲁棒的CVP系统提供了新范式，并扩展为双层优化框架。

Abstract: Existing methods for concealed visual perception (CVP) often leverage
reversible strategies to decrease uncertainty, yet these are typically confined
to the mask domain, leaving the potential of the RGB domain underexplored. To
address this, we propose a reversible unfolding network with generative
refinement, termed RUN++. Specifically, RUN++ first formulates the CVP task as
a mathematical optimization problem and unfolds the iterative solution into a
multi-stage deep network. This approach provides a principled way to apply
reversible modeling across both mask and RGB domains while leveraging a
diffusion model to resolve the resulting uncertainty. Each stage of the network
integrates three purpose-driven modules: a Concealed Object Region Extraction
(CORE) module applies reversible modeling to the mask domain to identify core
object regions; a Context-Aware Region Enhancement (CARE) module extends this
principle to the RGB domain to foster better foreground-background separation;
and a Finetuning Iteration via Noise-based Enhancement (FINE) module provides a
final refinement. The FINE module introduces a targeted Bernoulli diffusion
model that refines only the uncertain regions of the segmentation mask,
harnessing the generative power of diffusion for fine-detail restoration
without the prohibitive computational cost of a full-image process. This unique
synergy, where the unfolding network provides a strong uncertainty prior for
the diffusion model, allows RUN++ to efficiently direct its focus toward
ambiguous areas, significantly mitigating false positives and negatives.
Furthermore, we introduce a new paradigm for building robust CVP systems that
remain effective under real-world degradations and extend this concept into a
broader bi-level optimization framework.

Conclusion: GasTwinFormer通过有效利用饮食-排放相关性，为实时牲畜排放监测提供了实用解决方案，架构组件经过充分验证。

Abstract: Livestock methane emissions represent 32% of human-caused methane production,
making automated monitoring critical for climate mitigation strategies. We
introduce GasTwinFormer, a hybrid vision transformer for real-time methane
emission segmentation and dietary classification in optical gas imaging through
a novel Mix Twin encoder alternating between spatially-reduced global attention
and locally-grouped attention mechanisms. Our architecture incorporates a
lightweight LR-ASPP decoder for multi-scale feature aggregation and enables
simultaneous methane segmentation and dietary classification in a unified
framework. We contribute the first comprehensive beef cattle methane emission
dataset using OGI, containing 11,694 annotated frames across three dietary
treatments. GasTwinFormer achieves 74.47% mIoU and 83.63% mF1 for segmentation
while maintaining exceptional efficiency with only 3.348M parameters, 3.428G
FLOPs, and 114.9 FPS inference speed. Additionally, our method achieves perfect
dietary classification accuracy (100%), demonstrating the effectiveness of
leveraging diet-emission correlations. Extensive ablation studies validate each
architectural component, establishing GasTwinFormer as a practical solution for
real-time livestock emission monitoring. Please see our project page at

### [8] [CurveFlow: Curvature-Guided Flow Matching for Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15093)
*Yan Luo,Drake Du,Hao Huang,Yi Fang,Mengyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CurveFlow通过引入曲率正则化来学习非线性轨迹，显著提升了文本到图像生成的语义一致性和图像质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有整流流模型使用线性轨迹，可能迫使生成过程通过数据流形的低概率区域，影响语义对齐和指令遵循能力

Method: 提出CurveFlow框架，将曲率指导直接融入流路径，采用鲁棒的曲率正则化技术惩罚轨迹内在动力学的突变

Result: 在MS COCO数据集上达到最先进性能，在BLEU、METEOR、ROUGE和CLAIR等语义一致性指标上显著优于标准整流流变体和其他非线性基线

Conclusion: 曲率感知建模显著增强了模型忠实遵循复杂指令的能力，同时保持高质量图像生成

Abstract: Existing rectified flow models are based on linear trajectories between data
and noise distributions. This linearity enforces zero curvature, which can
inadvertently force the image generation process through low-probability
regions of the data manifold. A key question remains underexplored: how does
the curvature of these trajectories correlate with the semantic alignment
between generated images and their corresponding captions, i.e., instructional
compliance? To address this, we introduce CurveFlow, a novel flow matching
framework designed to learn smooth, non-linear trajectories by directly
incorporating curvature guidance into the flow path. Our method features a
robust curvature regularization technique that penalizes abrupt changes in the
trajectory's intrinsic dynamics.Extensive experiments on MS COCO 2014 and 2017
demonstrate that CurveFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance in
text-to-image generation, significantly outperforming both standard rectified
flow variants and other non-linear baselines like Rectified Diffusion. The
improvements are especially evident in semantic consistency metrics such as
BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, and CLAIR. This confirms that our curvature-aware modeling
substantially enhances the model's ability to faithfully follow complex
instructions while simultaneously maintaining high image quality. The code is
made publicly available at
https://github.com/Harvard-AI-and-Robotics-Lab/CurveFlow.

### [9] [Image-Conditioned 3D Gaussian Splat Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15372)
*Xinshuang Liu,Runfa Blark Li,Keito Suzuki,Truong Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ICGS-Quantizer方法，通过联合利用高斯间和属性间相关性，使用跨场景共享码本，将3D高斯泼溅压缩到千字节级别，并支持基于图像的条件解码以适应存档后的场景变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS压缩方法存在两个限制：(1)只能将中等规模场景压缩到兆字节范围，对大规模场景或场景集合仍不实用；(2)缺乏适应长期存档后场景变化的机制。

Method: 提出图像条件高斯泼溅量化器(ICGS-Quantizer)，通过联合利用高斯间和属性间相关性，使用跨所有训练场景的共享码本，消除逐场景码本开销。编码、量化和解码过程联合训练，使量化后的场景表示能够进行条件解码。

Result: 实验结果表明，ICGS-Quantizer在压缩效率和场景变化适应性方面持续优于最先进方法，将3DGS存储需求降低到千字节范围同时保持视觉保真度。

Conclusion: ICGS-Quantizer显著提升了压缩效率，并为存档后的场景变化提供了适应性，解决了现有3DGS压缩方法的局限性。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has attracted considerable attention for
enabling high-quality real-time rendering. Although 3DGS compression methods
have been proposed for deployment on storage-constrained devices, two
limitations hinder archival use: (1) they compress medium-scale scenes only to
the megabyte range, which remains impractical for large-scale scenes or
extensive scene collections; and (2) they lack mechanisms to accommodate scene
changes after long-term archival. To address these limitations, we propose an
Image-Conditioned Gaussian Splat Quantizer (ICGS-Quantizer) that substantially
enhances compression efficiency and provides adaptability to scene changes
after archiving. ICGS-Quantizer improves quantization efficiency by jointly
exploiting inter-Gaussian and inter-attribute correlations and by using shared
codebooks across all training scenes, which are then fixed and applied to
previously unseen test scenes, eliminating the overhead of per-scene codebooks.
This approach effectively reduces the storage requirements for 3DGS to the
kilobyte range while preserving visual fidelity. To enable adaptability to
post-archival scene changes, ICGS-Quantizer conditions scene decoding on images
captured at decoding time. The encoding, quantization, and decoding processes
are trained jointly, ensuring that the codes, which are quantized
representations of the scene, are effective for conditional decoding. We
evaluate ICGS-Quantizer on 3D scene compression and 3D scene updating.
Experimental results show that ICGS-Quantizer consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in compression efficiency and adaptability to scene
changes. Our code, model, and data will be publicly available on GitHub.

### [10] [HiRQA: Hierarchical Ranking and Quality Alignment for Opinion-Unaware Image Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15130)
*Vaishnav Ramesh,Haining Wang,Md Jahidul Islam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiRQA是一个自监督的无参考图像质量评估框架，通过分层排序和对齐学习实现质量感知嵌入，无需参考图像或主观标签，在合成和真实失真上均表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的无参考图像质量评估方法存在数据集偏差和依赖主观标签的问题，限制了其泛化性能。需要开发不依赖参考图像或辅助模态的自监督方法。

Method: 提出HiRQA框架，结合排序学习和对比学习：1）高阶排序损失监督质量预测；2）嵌入距离损失确保特征距离与感知差异一致；3）基于结构化文本提示的对比对齐损失增强表示学习。

Result: 仅在合成失真上训练，HiRQA能有效泛化到真实退化场景（如镜头光晕、雾霾、运动模糊、低光条件）。轻量版HiRQA-S推理时间仅3.5ms/图像，在合成和真实基准测试中达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: HiRQA通过自监督的层次化排序和对齐学习，实现了强大的泛化能力和实时部署性能，为无参考图像质量评估提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in no-reference image quality assessment
(NR-IQA), dataset biases and reliance on subjective labels continue to hinder
their generalization performance. We propose HiRQA, Hierarchical Ranking and
Quality Alignment), a self-supervised, opinion-unaware framework that offers a
hierarchical, quality-aware embedding through a combination of ranking and
contrastive learning. Unlike prior approaches that depend on pristine
references or auxiliary modalities at inference time, HiRQA predicts quality
scores using only the input image. We introduce a novel higher-order ranking
loss that supervises quality predictions through relational ordering across
distortion pairs, along with an embedding distance loss that enforces
consistency between feature distances and perceptual differences. A
training-time contrastive alignment loss, guided by structured textual prompts,
further enhances the learned representation. Trained only on synthetic
distortions, HiRQA generalizes effectively to authentic degradations, as
demonstrated through evaluation on various distortions such as lens flare,
haze, motion blur, and low-light conditions. For real-time deployment, we
introduce \textbf{HiRQA-S}, a lightweight variant with an inference time of
only 3.5 ms per image. Extensive experiments across synthetic and authentic
benchmarks validate HiRQA's state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, strong
generalization ability, and scalability.

### [11] [Reliable Multi-view 3D Reconstruction for `Just-in-time' Edge Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15158)
*Md. Nurul Absur,Abhinav Kumar,Swastik Brahma,Saptarshi Debroy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于投资组合理论的新型边缘资源管理策略，用于在系统可能发生中断的情况下实现可靠的多视角3D重建。该方法能够保证重建质量，即使相机面临时空相关的中断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多视角3D重建应用在需要快速态势感知的关键用例中越来越重要，但边缘环境的动态性和操作困难可能导致时空相关的中断，影响相机操作并导致重建质量持续下降。

Method: 采用投资组合理论启发的边缘资源管理策略，通过遗传算法解决投资组合理论优化问题，快速收敛于实际系统设置。

Result: 使用公开和定制3D数据集验证，证明所提出的相机选择策略在时空中断下比传统基线策略更能保证可靠的3D重建。

Conclusion: 该方法为边缘环境中的多视角3D重建提供了一种可靠的资源管理解决方案，能够有效应对时空相关的中断问题。

Abstract: Multi-view 3D reconstruction applications are revolutionizing critical use
cases that require rapid situational-awareness, such as emergency response,
tactical scenarios, and public safety. In many cases, their near-real-time
latency requirements and ad-hoc needs for compute resources necessitate
adoption of `Just-in-time' edge environments where the system is set up on the
fly to support the applications during the mission lifetime. However,
reliability issues can arise from the inherent dynamism and operational
adversities of such edge environments, resulting in spatiotemporally correlated
disruptions that impact the camera operations, which can lead to sustained
degradation of reconstruction quality. In this paper, we propose a novel
portfolio theory inspired edge resource management strategy for reliable
multi-view 3D reconstruction against possible system disruptions. Our proposed
methodology can guarantee reconstruction quality satisfaction even when the
cameras are prone to spatiotemporally correlated disruptions. The portfolio
theoretic optimization problem is solved using a genetic algorithm that
converges quickly for realistic system settings. Using publicly available and
customized 3D datasets, we demonstrate the proposed camera selection strategy's
benefits in guaranteeing reliable 3D reconstruction against traditional
baseline strategies, under spatiotemporal disruptions.

### [12] [Scaling Group Inference for Diverse and High-Quality Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15773)
*Gaurav Parmar,Or Patashnik,Daniil Ostashev,Kuan-Chieh Wang,Kfir Aberman,Srinivasa Narasimhan,Jun-Yan Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种可扩展的组推理方法，通过将组推理建模为二次整数分配问题，在保证样本质量的同时最大化组内多样性，解决了生成模型中独立采样导致的冗余问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统生成模型独立采样导致输出冗余，限制了用户选择和创意探索。在实际应用中，用户通常需要一组多样化的输出结果。

Method: 将组推理建模为二次整数分配问题：候选输出作为图节点，通过优化样本质量（一元项）和最大化组多样性（二元项）来选择子集。采用渐进式剪枝策略提高运行效率。

Result: 实验表明，该方法相比独立采样基线和近期推理算法，显著提高了组的多样性和质量。框架适用于文本到图像、图像到图像、图像提示和视频生成等多种任务。

Conclusion: 该方法使生成模型能够将多个输出视为有凝聚力的组而非独立样本，为实际应用提供了更有效的多输出生成解决方案。

Abstract: Generative models typically sample outputs independently, and recent
inference-time guidance and scaling algorithms focus on improving the quality
of individual samples. However, in real-world applications, users are often
presented with a set of multiple images (e.g., 4-8) for each prompt, where
independent sampling tends to lead to redundant results, limiting user choices
and hindering idea exploration. In this work, we introduce a scalable group
inference method that improves both the diversity and quality of a group of
samples. We formulate group inference as a quadratic integer assignment
problem: candidate outputs are modeled as graph nodes, and a subset is selected
to optimize sample quality (unary term) while maximizing group diversity
(binary term). To substantially improve runtime efficiency, we progressively
prune the candidate set using intermediate predictions, allowing our method to
scale up to large candidate sets. Extensive experiments show that our method
significantly improves group diversity and quality compared to independent
sampling baselines and recent inference algorithms. Our framework generalizes
across a wide range of tasks, including text-to-image, image-to-image, image
prompting, and video generation, enabling generative models to treat multiple
outputs as cohesive groups rather than independent samples.

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a major cause of global blindness, necessitating
early and accurate diagnosis. While deep learning models have shown promise in
DR detection, their black-box nature often hinders clinical adoption due to a
lack of transparency and interpretability. To address this, we propose XDR-LVLM
(eXplainable Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis with LVLM), a novel framework that
leverages Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) for high-precision DR diagnosis
coupled with natural language-based explanations. XDR-LVLM integrates a
specialized Medical Vision Encoder, an LVLM Core, and employs Multi-task Prompt
Engineering and Multi-stage Fine-tuning to deeply understand pathological
features within fundus images and generate comprehensive diagnostic reports.
These reports explicitly include DR severity grading, identification of key
pathological concepts (e.g., hemorrhages, exudates, microaneurysms), and
detailed explanations linking observed features to the diagnosis. Extensive
experiments on the Diabetic Retinopathy (DDR) dataset demonstrate that XDR-LVLM
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a Balanced Accuracy of 84.55% and
an F1 Score of 79.92% for disease diagnosis, and superior results for concept
detection (77.95% BACC, 66.88% F1). Furthermore, human evaluations confirm the
high fluency, accuracy, and clinical utility of the generated explanations,
showcasing XDR-LVLM's ability to bridge the gap between automated diagnosis and
clinical needs by providing robust and interpretable insights.

Conclusion: MeSS方法成功解决了城市网格模型纹理缺失问题，为虚拟城市导航和自动驾驶提供了高质量的纹理化三维场景生成方案。

Abstract: Mesh models have become increasingly accessible for numerous cities; however,
the lack of realistic textures restricts their application in virtual urban
navigation and autonomous driving. To address this, this paper proposes MeSS
(Meshbased Scene Synthesis) for generating high-quality, styleconsistent
outdoor scenes with city mesh models serving as the geometric prior. While
image and video diffusion models can leverage spatial layouts (such as depth
maps or HD maps) as control conditions to generate street-level perspective
views, they are not directly applicable to 3D scene generation. Video diffusion
models excel at synthesizing consistent view sequences that depict scenes but
often struggle to adhere to predefined camera paths or align accurately with
rendered control videos. In contrast, image diffusion models, though unable to
guarantee cross-view visual consistency, can produce more geometry-aligned
results when combined with ControlNet. Building on this insight, our approach
enhances image diffusion models by improving cross-view consistency. The
pipeline comprises three key stages: first, we generate geometrically
consistent sparse views using Cascaded Outpainting ControlNets; second, we
propagate denser intermediate views via a component dubbed AGInpaint; and
third, we globally eliminate visual inconsistencies (e.g., varying exposure)
using the GCAlign module. Concurrently with generation, a 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) scene is reconstructed by initializing Gaussian balls on the mesh
surface. Our method outperforms existing approaches in both geometric alignment
and generation quality. Once synthesized, the scene can be rendered in diverse
styles through relighting and style transfer techniques.

agents to cause failure scenarios. We evaluate our adversarial agent against
all the rule based agents and show the decrease in cumulative reward.

Conclusion: DyMorph-B2I能够促进肾脏病理学工作流程中更准确的形态计量分析，该管道已公开可用

Abstract: Accurate morphological quantification of renal pathology functional units
relies on instance-level segmentation, yet most existing datasets and automated
methods provide only binary (semantic) masks, limiting the precision of
downstream analyses. Although classical post-processing techniques such as
watershed, morphological operations, and skeletonization, are often used to
separate semantic masks into instances, their individual effectiveness is
constrained by the diverse morphologies and complex connectivity found in renal
tissue. In this study, we present DyMorph-B2I, a dynamic, morphology-guided
binary-to-instance segmentation pipeline tailored for renal pathology. Our
approach integrates watershed, skeletonization, and morphological operations
within a unified framework, complemented by adaptive geometric refinement and
customizable hyperparameter tuning for each class of functional unit. Through
systematic parameter optimization, DyMorph-B2I robustly separates adherent and
heterogeneous structures present in binary masks. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms individual classical approaches and
na\"ive combinations, enabling superior instance separation and facilitating
more accurate morphometric analysis in renal pathology workflows. The pipeline

Abstract: Accident prediction and timely warnings play a key role in improving road
safety by reducing the risk of injury to road users and minimizing property
damage. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are designed to support human
drivers and are especially useful when they can anticipate potential accidents
before they happen. While many existing systems depend on a range of sensors
such as LiDAR, radar, and GPS, relying solely on dash-cam video input presents
a more challenging but a more cost-effective and easily deployable solution. In
this work, we incorporate better spatio-temporal features and aggregate them
through a recurrent network to improve upon state-of-the-art graph neural
networks for predicting accidents from dash-cam videos. Experiments using three
publicly available datasets show that our proposed STAGNet model achieves
higher average precision and mean time-to-collision values than previous
methods, both when cross-validated on a given dataset and when trained and
tested on different datasets.

TL;DR: TriMM是首个前馈式3D原生生成模型，通过整合RGB、RGBD和点云等多模态数据，利用协作多模态编码和三平面潜在扩散模型生成高质量3D资产。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D生成模型大多局限于单一模态或3D结构，无法充分利用多模态数据的互补优势，限制了训练数据集的范围和模型性能。

Method: 1) 引入协作多模态编码整合模态特定特征；2) 使用辅助2D和3D监督提升鲁棒性；3) 基于三平面潜在扩散模型生成高质量3D资产

Result: 在多个知名数据集上的实验表明，TriMM通过有效利用多模态数据，在使用少量训练数据的情况下实现了与大规模数据集训练模型相竞争的性能。

Conclusion: TriMM证明了多模态数据在3D生成中的有效性，并验证了将其他多模态数据集整合到3D生成中的可行性。

Abstract: 3D content inherently encompasses multi-modal characteristics and can be
projected into different modalities (e.g., RGB images, RGBD, and point clouds).
Each modality exhibits distinct advantages in 3D asset modeling: RGB images
contain vivid 3D textures, whereas point clouds define fine-grained 3D
geometries. However, most existing 3D-native generative architectures either
operate predominantly within single-modality paradigms-thus overlooking the
complementary benefits of multi-modality data-or restrict themselves to 3D
structures, thereby limiting the scope of available training datasets. To
holistically harness multi-modalities for 3D modeling, we present TriMM, the
first feed-forward 3D-native generative model that learns from basic
multi-modalities (e.g., RGB, RGBD, and point cloud). Specifically, 1) TriMM
first introduces collaborative multi-modal coding, which integrates
modality-specific features while preserving their unique representational
strengths. 2) Furthermore, auxiliary 2D and 3D supervision are introduced to
raise the robustness and performance of multi-modal coding. 3) Based on the
embedded multi-modal code, TriMM employs a triplane latent diffusion model to
generate 3D assets of superior quality, enhancing both the texture and the
geometric detail. Extensive experiments on multiple well-known datasets
demonstrate that TriMM, by effectively leveraging multi-modality, achieves
competitive performance with models trained on large-scale datasets, despite
utilizing a small amount of training data. Furthermore, we conduct additional
experiments on recent RGB-D datasets, verifying the feasibility of
incorporating other multi-modal datasets into 3D generation.

Result: 在五个数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法相比最先进方法具有有效性

Conclusion: 提出的中心导向原型对比聚类框架能够有效解决类间冲突问题，减少原型漂移，提供可靠的原型计算保证

Abstract: Contrastive learning is widely used in clustering tasks due to its
discriminative representation. However, the conflict problem between classes is
difficult to solve effectively. Existing methods try to solve this problem
through prototype contrast, but there is a deviation between the calculation of
hard prototypes and the true cluster center. To address this problem, we
propose a center-oriented prototype contrastive clustering framework, which
consists of a soft prototype contrastive module and a dual consistency learning
module. In short, the soft prototype contrastive module uses the probability
that the sample belongs to the cluster center as a weight to calculate the
prototype of each category, while avoiding inter-class conflicts and reducing
prototype drift. The dual consistency learning module aligns different
transformations of the same sample and the neighborhoods of different samples
respectively, ensuring that the features have transformation-invariant semantic
information and compact intra-cluster distribution, while providing reliable
guarantees for the calculation of prototypes. Extensive experiments on five
datasets show that the proposed method is effective compared to the SOTA. Our
code is published on https://github.com/LouisDong95/CPCC.

Motivation: 传统单机航空视觉-语言导航存在轨迹过长、操纵复杂、需要人工干预或过于详细指令的问题，而无人机高机动性的优势可以提供多粒度视角，需要新的方案来利用这一优势同时维持可管理的运动空间

Abstract: Aerial Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is an emerging task that enables
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to navigate outdoor environments using natural
language instructions and visual cues. However, due to the extended
trajectories and complex maneuverability of UAVs, achieving reliable UAV-VLN
performance is challenging and often requires human intervention or overly
detailed instructions. To harness the advantages of UAVs' high mobility, which
could provide multi-grained perspectives, while maintaining a manageable motion
space for learning, we introduce a novel task called Dual-Altitude UAV
Collaborative VLN (DuAl-VLN). In this task, two UAVs operate at distinct
altitudes: a high-altitude UAV responsible for broad environmental reasoning,
and a low-altitude UAV tasked with precise navigation. To support the training
and evaluation of the DuAl-VLN, we construct the HaL-13k, a dataset comprising
13,838 collaborative high-low UAV demonstration trajectories, each paired with
target-oriented language instructions. This dataset includes both unseen maps
and an unseen object validation set to systematically evaluate the model's
generalization capabilities across novel environments and unfamiliar targets.
To consolidate their complementary strengths, we propose a dual-UAV
collaborative VLN framework, AeroDuo, where the high-altitude UAV integrates a
multimodal large language model (Pilot-LLM) for target reasoning, while the
low-altitude UAV employs a lightweight multi-stage policy for navigation and
target grounding. The two UAVs work collaboratively and only exchange minimal
coordinate information to ensure efficiency.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种跳过步采样机制，可以直接绕过多个中间去噪步骤，实现扩散模型的高效采样，证明了马尔可夫方式的加速采样是预训练扩散模型的内在属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽然在各生成任务中表现优异，但其顺序生成过程需要多步迭代，采样效率较低。现有方法如DDIM通过非马尔可夫过程减少采样步数，但缺乏对原始扩散过程是否能在保持马尔可夫性的情况下实现相同效率的理解。

Method: 提出了跳过步采样机制，直接从噪声状态跳过多个中间步骤进行采样，而不是传统的逐步细化。该方法与标准扩散模型具有相同的训练目标，并与DDIM结合形成增强的生成方法。

Result: 在OpenAI ADM、Stable Diffusion和Open Sora等流行预训练扩散模型上的大量实验表明，该方法能够以显著减少的采样步数实现高质量生成。

Conclusion: 跳过步采样机制是预训练扩散模型的内在属性，通过马尔可夫方式实现加速采样，为扩散模型的高效推理提供了新的思路和方法。

Abstract: Diffusion models have been achieving state-of-the-art results across various
generation tasks. However, a notable drawback is their sequential generation
process, requiring long-sequence step-by-step generation. Existing methods,
such as DDIM, attempt to reduce sampling steps by constructing a class of
non-Markovian diffusion processes that maintain the same training objective.
However, there remains a gap in understanding whether the original diffusion
process can achieve the same efficiency without resorting to non-Markovian
processes. In this paper, we provide a confirmative answer and introduce
skipped-step sampling, a mechanism that bypasses multiple intermediate
denoising steps in the iterative generation process, in contrast with the
traditional step-by-step refinement of standard diffusion inference. Crucially,
we demonstrate that this skipped-step sampling mechanism is derived from the
same training objective as the standard diffusion model, indicating that
accelerated sampling via skipped-step sampling via a Markovian way is an
intrinsic property of pretrained diffusion models. Additionally, we propose an
enhanced generation method by integrating our accelerated sampling technique
with DDIM. Extensive experiments on popular pretrained diffusion models,
including the OpenAI ADM, Stable Diffusion, and Open Sora models, show that our
method achieves high-quality generation with significantly reduced sampling
steps.

Abstract: We present Comp-X, the first intelligently interactive image compression
paradigm empowered by the impressive reasoning capability of large language
model (LLM) agent. Notably, commonly used image codecs usually suffer from
limited coding modes and rely on manual mode selection by engineers, making
them unfriendly for unprofessional users. To overcome this, we advance the
evolution of image coding paradigm by introducing three key innovations: (i)
multi-functional coding framework, which unifies different coding modes of
various objective/requirements, including human-machine perception, variable
coding, and spatial bit allocation, into one framework. (ii) interactive coding
agent, where we propose an augmented in-context learning method with coding
expert feedback to teach the LLM agent how to understand the coding request,
mode selection, and the use of the coding tools. (iii) IIC-bench, the first
dedicated benchmark comprising diverse user requests and the corresponding
annotations from coding experts, which is systematically designed for
intelligently interactive image compression evaluation. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed Comp-X can understand the coding requests
efficiently and achieve impressive textual interaction capability. Meanwhile,
it can maintain comparable compression performance even with a single coding
framework, providing a promising avenue for artificial general intelligence
(AGI) in image compression.

Method: 重构Transformer解码器结构，交换交叉注意力和自注意力层顺序；实例化多个并行交叉注意力块；实现一对多冗余分配策略

Result: 在OpenLane-V2数据集上的大量实验表明，RATopo策略具有模型无关性，能无缝集成到现有拓扑推理框架中，持续提升车道-车道和车道-交通拓扑性能

Conclusion: RATopo通过冗余分配策略实现了数量丰富和几何多样化的拓扑监督，有效解决了现有方法监督范围有限的问题，显著提升了车道拓扑推理性能

Abstract: Lane topology reasoning plays a critical role in autonomous driving by
modeling the connections among lanes and the topological relationships between
lanes and traffic elements. Most existing methods adopt a
first-detect-then-reason paradigm, where topological relationships are
supervised based on the one-to-one assignment results obtained during the
detection stage. This supervision strategy results in suboptimal topology
reasoning performance due to the limited range of valid supervision. In this
paper, we propose RATopo, a Redundancy Assignment strategy for lane Topology
reasoning that enables quantity-rich and geometry-diverse topology supervision.
Specifically, we restructure the Transformer decoder by swapping the
cross-attention and self-attention layers. This allows redundant lane
predictions to be retained before suppression, enabling effective one-to-many
assignment. We also instantiate multiple parallel cross-attention blocks with
independent parameters, which further enhances the diversity of detected lanes.
Extensive experiments on OpenLane-V2 demonstrate that our RATopo strategy is
model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing topology
reasoning frameworks, consistently improving both lane-lane and lane-traffic
topology performance.

Abstract: In the field of design patent analysis, traditional tasks such as patent
classification and patent image retrieval heavily depend on the image data.
However, patent images -- typically consisting of sketches with abstract and
structural elements of an invention -- often fall short in conveying
comprehensive visual context and semantic information. This inadequacy can lead
to ambiguities in evaluation during prior art searches. Recent advancements in
vision-language models, such as CLIP, offer promising opportunities for more
reliable and accurate AI-driven patent analysis. In this work, we leverage CLIP
models to develop a unified framework DesignCLIP for design patent applications
with a large-scale dataset of U.S. design patents. To address the unique
characteristics of patent data, DesignCLIP incorporates class-aware
classification and contrastive learning, utilizing generated detailed captions
for patent images and multi-views image learning. We validate the effectiveness
of DesignCLIP across various downstream tasks, including patent classification
and patent retrieval. Additionally, we explore multimodal patent retrieval,
which provides the potential to enhance creativity and innovation in design by
offering more diverse sources of inspiration. Our experiments show that
DesignCLIP consistently outperforms baseline and SOTA models in the patent
domain on all tasks. Our findings underscore the promise of multimodal

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声视频中的先天性心脏病检测受图像噪声和探头位置变异性的影响，现有机器学习方法往往忽略时间信息、仅限于二元分类且缺乏预测校准。

Conclusion: TPA框架通过整合时间建模、提示感知对比学习和不确定性量化，在胎儿先天性心脏病超声视频分类中实现了优异的性能和临床可靠性。

Abstract: Congenital heart defect (CHD) detection in ultrasound videos is hindered by
image noise and probe positioning variability. While automated methods can
reduce operator dependence, current machine learning approaches often neglect
temporal information, limit themselves to binary classification, and do not
account for prediction calibration. We propose Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA),
a method leveraging foundation image-text model and prompt-aware contrastive
learning to classify fetal CHD on cardiac ultrasound videos. TPA extracts
features from each frame of video subclips using an image encoder, aggregates
them with a trainable temporal extractor to capture heart motion, and aligns
the video representation with class-specific text prompts via a margin-hinge
contrastive loss. To enhance calibration for clinical reliability, we introduce
a Conditional Variational Autoencoder Style Modulation (CVAESM) module, which
learns a latent style vector to modulate embeddings and quantifies
classification uncertainty. Evaluated on a private dataset for CHD detection

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 一种基于冲突地图(CMs)的新题方法CM2LoD3，通过语义分割真实世界和合成冲突地图来自动重建LOD3级别建筑模型，解决了传统手工建模的大规模采用挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LOD1和LOD2建筑模型广泛可用，但缺乏立面元素细节，而LOD3模型能够包含窗户、门户等立面元素，但传统面临手工建模的大规模采用挑战。

Method: 利用光线到模型先验分析获得冲突地图(CMs)，通过语义冲突地图生成器(SCMG)生成合成CMs并进行语义分割，同时融合素材模型的分割结果来提升性能。

Result: 实验结果显示CM2LoD3方法在分割和重建建筑开放部位方面有效，使用不确定性明感融合技术达到61%的性能。

Conclusion: 这项研究推进了自动化LOD3模型重建的进展，为可扩展和高效的3D城市建模打开了途径。

Abstract: Detailed 3D building models are crucial for urban planning, digital twins,
and disaster management applications. While Level of Detail 1 (LoD)1 and LoD2
building models are widely available, they lack detailed facade elements
essential for advanced urban analysis. In contrast, LoD3 models address this
limitation by incorporating facade elements such as windows, doors, and
underpasses. However, their generation has traditionally required manual
modeling, making large-scale adoption challenging. In this contribution,
CM2LoD3, we present a novel method for reconstructing LoD3 building models
leveraging Conflict Maps (CMs) obtained from ray-to-model-prior analysis.
Unlike previous works, we concentrate on semantically segmenting real-world CMs
with synthetically generated CMs from our developed Semantic Conflict Map
Generator (SCMG). We also observe that additional segmentation of textured
models can be fused with CMs using confidence scores to further increase
segmentation performance and thus increase 3D reconstruction accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our CM2LoD3 method in
segmenting and reconstructing building openings, with the 61% performance with
uncertainty-aware fusion of segmented building textures. This research
contributes to the advancement of automated LoD3 model reconstruction, paving
the way for scalable and efficient 3D city modeling. Our project is available:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多摄像头系统受限于2D视频数据和复杂3D重建处理，难以实现实时分析。篮球运动场景复杂，球员快速移动且遮挡频繁，需要更有效的跟踪方案

Method: 构建包含LiDAR点云和同步多视角摄像头的多模态数据集，开发基于LiDAR高精度3D空间信息的MOT算法，包括纯LiDAR实时跟踪和LiDAR-摄像头融合的多模态跟踪管道

Conclusion: BasketLiDAR数据集和提出的MOT框架为体育MOT领域提供了新的解决方案，结合LiDAR的3D空间信息显著提升了跟踪精度和实时性能

Abstract: Real-time 3D trajectory player tracking in sports plays a crucial role in
tactical analysis, performance evaluation, and enhancing spectator experience.
Traditional systems rely on multi-camera setups, but are constrained by the
inherently two-dimensional nature of video data and the need for complex 3D
reconstruction processing, making real-time analysis challenging. Basketball,
in particular, represents one of the most difficult scenarios in the MOT field,
as ten players move rapidly and complexly within a confined court space, with
frequent occlusions caused by intense physical contact.
  To address these challenges, this paper constructs BasketLiDAR, the first
multimodal dataset in the sports MOT field that combines LiDAR point clouds
with synchronized multi-view camera footage in a professional basketball
environment, and proposes a novel MOT framework that simultaneously achieves
improved tracking accuracy and reduced computational cost. The BasketLiDAR
dataset contains a total of 4,445 frames and 3,105 player IDs, with fully
synchronized IDs between three LiDAR sensors and three multi-view cameras. We
recorded 5-on-5 and 3-on-3 game data from actual professional basketball
players, providing complete 3D positional information and ID annotations for
each player. Based on this dataset, we developed a novel MOT algorithm that
leverages LiDAR's high-precision 3D spatial information. The proposed method
consists of a real-time tracking pipeline using LiDAR alone and a multimodal
tracking pipeline that fuses LiDAR and camera data. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach achieves real-time operation, which was difficult
with conventional camera-only methods, while achieving superior tracking
performance even under occlusion conditions. The dataset is available upon

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有伪装目标检测方法需要大量训练和计算资源，而基础模型如SAM需要高质量提示才能发挥性能，手动生成提示成本高且低效。

Method: 提出两阶段训练免费范式：第一阶段通过无监督聚类构建检索数据库进行特征检索生成粗掩码提示；第二阶段使用SAM2进行精细分割。

Result: 在基准COD数据集上实验表明，RAG-SEG性能与或超过最先进方法，所有实验均在个人笔记本上完成，计算效率高。

Conclusion: RAG-SEG无需传统训练即可保持竞争力，提供了计算高效且实用的伪装目标检测解决方案。

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection (COD) poses a significant challenge in computer
vision due to the high similarity between objects and their backgrounds.
Existing approaches often rely on heavy training and large computational
resources. While foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
offer strong generalization, they still struggle to handle COD tasks without
fine-tuning and require high-quality prompts to yield good performance.
However, generating such prompts manually is costly and inefficient. To address
these challenges, we propose \textbf{First RAG, Second SEG (RAG-SEG)}, a
training-free paradigm that decouples COD into two stages: Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) for generating coarse masks as prompts, followed by SAM-based
segmentation (SEG) for refinement. RAG-SEG constructs a compact retrieval
database via unsupervised clustering, enabling fast and effective feature
retrieval. During inference, the retrieved features produce pseudo-labels that
guide precise mask generation using SAM2. Our method eliminates the need for
conventional training while maintaining competitive performance. Extensive
experiments on benchmark COD datasets demonstrate that RAG-SEG performs on par
with or surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Notably, all experiments are
conducted on a \textbf{personal laptop}, highlighting the computational
efficiency and practicality of our approach. We present further analysis in the
Appendix, covering limitations, salient object detection extension, and
possible improvements.

Method: 提出了VideoEraser框架，采用两阶段处理：选择性提示嵌入调整（SPEA）和抗干扰噪声引导（ARNG），作为即插即用模块与现有T2V模型集成

Result: 在四个任务（物体擦除、艺术风格擦除、名人擦除和显式内容擦除）上进行了广泛评估，平均减少46%的不良内容生成，在效果、完整性、保真度、鲁棒性和泛化性方面均优于现有方法

Conclusion: VideoEraser在抑制T2V生成中的不良内容方面达到了最先进的性能，为控制扩散模型的潜在滥用提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: The rapid growth of text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models has raised concerns
about privacy, copyright, and safety due to their potential misuse in
generating harmful or misleading content. These models are often trained on
numerous datasets, including unauthorized personal identities, artistic
creations, and harmful materials, which can lead to uncontrolled production and
distribution of such content. To address this, we propose VideoEraser, a
training-free framework that prevents T2V diffusion models from generating
videos with undesirable concepts, even when explicitly prompted with those
concepts. Designed as a plug-and-play module, VideoEraser can seamlessly
integrate with representative T2V diffusion models via a two-stage process:
Selective Prompt Embedding Adjustment (SPEA) and Adversarial-Resilient Noise
Guidance (ARNG). We conduct extensive evaluations across four tasks, including
object erasure, artistic style erasure, celebrity erasure, and explicit content
erasure. Experimental results show that VideoEraser consistently outperforms
prior methods regarding efficacy, integrity, fidelity, robustness, and
generalizability. Notably, VideoEraser achieves state-of-the-art performance in
suppressing undesirable content during T2V generation, reducing it by 46% on
average across four tasks compared to baselines.

require sensors and cameras to detect objects and maneuver according to that.
It becomes important to for such vehicles to also predict from a distant if a
person is about to cross a road or not. The current study focused on predicting
the intent of crossing the road by pedestrians in an experimental setup. The
study involved working with deep learning models to predict poses and sequence
modelling for temporal predictions. The study analysed three different sequence
modelling to understand the prediction behaviour and it was found out that GRU
was better in predicting the intent compared to LSTM model but 1D CNN was the
best model in terms of speed. The study involved video analysis, and the output
of pose detection model was integrated later on to sequence modelling
techniques for an end-to-end deep learning framework for predicting road
crossing intents.

Motivation: 现有Video-LLMs研究主要关注性能提升，对其内部工作机制理解有限，需要系统性的实证研究来揭示模型如何处理和理解视频内容。

Method: 采用注意力敲除作为主要分析工具，设计三种敲除变体（时间、空间、语言到视频），在不同层数窗口上应用，设置全局和细粒度两种分析设置。

Result: 发现视频信息提取主要在早期层完成，形成感知编码和抽象推理两阶段过程；中间层存在对视频问答影响巨大的关键异常层；时空建模更依赖语言引导检索。

Conclusion: 这些发现可用于减少Video-LLMs的注意力计算，为未来研究提供可解释性和效率视角，是首个系统揭示Video-LLMs内部视频处理机制的工作。

Abstract: Taking advantage of large-scale data and pretrained language models, Video
Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in answering
video questions. However, most existing efforts focus on improving performance,
with limited attention to understanding their internal mechanisms. This paper
aims to bridge this gap through a systematic empirical study. To interpret
existing VideoLLMs, we adopt attention knockouts as our primary analytical tool
and design three variants: Video Temporal Knockout, Video Spatial Knockout, and
Language-to-Video Knockout. Then, we apply these three knockouts on different
numbers of layers (window of layers). By carefully controlling the window of
layers and types of knockouts, we provide two settings: a global setting and a
fine-grained setting. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) Global setting
indicates Video information extraction primarily occurs in early layers,
forming a clear two-stage process -- lower layers focus on perceptual encoding,
while higher layers handle abstract reasoning; (2) In the fine-grained setting,
certain intermediate layers exert an outsized impact on video question
answering, acting as critical outliers, whereas most other layers contribute
minimally; (3) In both settings, we observe that spatial-temporal modeling
relies more on language-guided retrieval than on intra- and inter-frame
self-attention among video tokens, despite the latter's high computational
cost. Finally, we demonstrate that these insights can be leveraged to reduce
attention computation in Video-LLMs. To our knowledge, this is the first work
to systematically uncover how Video-LLMs internally process and understand
video content, offering interpretability and efficiency perspectives for future
research.

Conclusion: 通过集中微调过程在相关层子集上，BioTune减少了可训练参数数量，降低了计算成本，促进了跨不同数据特征和分布的更高效迁移学习。

Abstract: Deep learning has shown substantial progress in image analysis. However, the
computational demands of large, fully trained models remain a consideration.
Transfer learning offers a strategy for adapting pre-trained models to new
tasks. Traditional fine-tuning often involves updating all model parameters,
which can potentially lead to overfitting and higher computational costs. This
paper introduces BioTune, an evolutionary adaptive fine-tuning technique that
selectively fine-tunes layers to enhance transfer learning efficiency. BioTune
employs an evolutionary algorithm to identify a focused set of layers for
fine-tuning, aiming to optimize model performance on a given target task.
Evaluation across nine image classification datasets from various domains
indicates that BioTune achieves competitive or improved accuracy and efficiency
compared to existing fine-tuning methods such as AutoRGN and LoRA. By
concentrating the fine-tuning process on a subset of relevant layers, BioTune
reduces the number of trainable parameters, potentially leading to decreased
computational cost and facilitating more efficient transfer learning across
diverse data characteristics and distributions.

Motivation: 解决驾驶场景中快速移动车辆、行人和大规模静态背景对3D场景重建带来的挑战，现有基于3D高斯泼溅的方法在解耦动态静态组件时忽视了背景优化的几何关系，仅通过添加高斯拟合训练视图，导致新视角渲染鲁棒性有限且缺乏准确几何表示。

Conclusion: DriveSplat通过创新的动态-静态解耦方法和几何先验监督，有效解决了驾驶场景3D重建的挑战，实现了高质量的新视角渲染和准确的几何表示。

Abstract: In the realm of driving scenarios, the presence of rapidly moving vehicles,
pedestrians in motion, and large-scale static backgrounds poses significant
challenges for 3D scene reconstruction. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian
Splatting address the motion blur problem by decoupling dynamic and static
components within the scene. However, these decoupling strategies overlook
background optimization with adequate geometry relationships and rely solely on
fitting each training view by adding Gaussians. Therefore, these models exhibit
limited robustness in rendering novel views and lack an accurate geometric
representation. To address the above issues, we introduce DriveSplat, a
high-quality reconstruction method for driving scenarios based on neural
Gaussian representations with dynamic-static decoupling. To better accommodate
the predominantly linear motion patterns of driving viewpoints, a region-wise
voxel initialization scheme is employed, which partitions the scene into near,
middle, and far regions to enhance close-range detail representation.
Deformable neural Gaussians are introduced to model non-rigid dynamic actors,
whose parameters are temporally adjusted by a learnable deformation network.
The entire framework is further supervised by depth and normal priors from
pre-trained models, improving the accuracy of geometric structures. Our method
has been rigorously evaluated on the Waymo and KITTI datasets, demonstrating
state-of-the-art performance in novel-view synthesis for driving scenarios.

Motivation: 当前深度学习模型在抽象推理方面存在根本性瓶颈，Raven渐进矩阵问题被用作评估算法抽象推理能力的权威基准。本文旨在通过解决RPM问题来提升机器智能的抽象推理能力。

Method: 采用因果链建模视角分析RPM任务完整因果链，设计基线模型DIO的网络架构。针对DIO优化目标的局限性，逐步提出三种改进方法。

Result: 实验发现DIO模型的优化目标（最大化上下文与正确选项间互信息的变分下界）无法让模型真正获得预设的人类推理逻辑，主要原因是下界紧致性影响互信息最大化效果，以及互信息作为统计度量无法捕捉主客体间的因果关系。

Conclusion: 需要克服互信息最大化方法的局限性，通过提出的三种改进方法来更好地捕捉RPM任务中的因果关系，从而提升模型的抽象推理能力。

Abstract: Despite the outstanding performance of current deep learning models across
various domains, their fundamental bottleneck in abstract reasoning remains
unresolved. To address this challenge, the academic community has introduced
Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) problems as an authoritative benchmark for
evaluating the abstract reasoning capabilities of deep learning algorithms,
with a focus on core intelligence dimensions such as abstract reasoning,
pattern recognition, and complex problem-solving. Therefore, this paper centers
on solving RPM problems, aiming to contribute to enhancing the abstract
reasoning abilities of machine intelligence. Firstly, this paper adopts a
``causal chain modeling'' perspective to systematically analyze the complete
causal chain in RPM tasks: image $\rightarrow$ abstract attributes
$\rightarrow$ progressive attribute patterns $\rightarrow$ pattern consistency
$\rightarrow$ correct answer. Based on this analysis, the network architecture
of the baseline model DIO is designed. However, experiments reveal that the
optimization objective formulated for DIO, namely maximizing the variational
lower bound of mutual information between the context and the correct option,
fails to enable the model to genuinely acquire the predefined human reasoning
logic. This is attributed to two main reasons: the tightness of the lower bound
significantly impacts the effectiveness of mutual information maximization, and
mutual information, as a statistical measure, does not capture the causal
relationship between subjects and objects. To overcome these limitations, this
paper progressively proposes three improvement methods:

Result: 在SumMe、TVSum、VideoXum、QFVS等多个数据集上超越现有方法

Conclusion: SpiVG网络能有效提升信息密度、降低计算复杂度，解决视频摘要中的关键挑战

Abstract: With the rise of short video content, efficient video summarization
techniques for extracting key information have become crucial. However,
existing methods struggle to capture the global temporal dependencies and
maintain the semantic coherence of video content. Additionally, these methods
are also influenced by noise during multi-channel feature fusion. We propose a
Spiking Variational Graph (SpiVG) Network, which enhances information density
and reduces computational complexity. First, we design a keyframe extractor
based on Spiking Neural Networks (SNN), leveraging the event-driven computation
mechanism of SNNs to learn keyframe features autonomously. To enable
fine-grained and adaptable reasoning across video frames, we introduce a
Dynamic Aggregation Graph Reasoner, which decouples contextual object
consistency from semantic perspective coherence. We present a Variational
Inference Reconstruction Module to address uncertainty and noise arising during
multi-channel feature fusion. In this module, we employ Evidence Lower Bound
Optimization (ELBO) to capture the latent structure of multi-channel feature
distributions, using posterior distribution regularization to reduce
overfitting. Experimental results show that SpiVG surpasses existing methods
across multiple datasets such as SumMe, TVSum, VideoXum, and QFVS. Our codes

Conclusion: 研究为实践中如何选择MAE超参数提供了理论见解，帮助更好地理解和优化MAE在视觉基础模型中的表现。

Abstract: Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) have emerged as a powerful pretraining technique
for vision foundation models. Despite their effectiveness, they require
extensive hyperparameter tuning (masking ratio, patch size, encoder/decoder
layers) when applied to novel datasets. While prior theoretical works have
analyzed MAEs in terms of their attention patterns and hierarchical latent
variable models, the connection between MAE hyperparameters and performance on
downstream tasks is relatively unexplored. This work investigates how MAEs
learn spatial correlations in the input image. We analytically derive the
features learned by a linear MAE and show that masking ratio and patch size can
be used to select for features that capture short- and long-range spatial
correlations. We extend this analysis to non-linear MAEs to show that MAE
representations adapt to spatial correlations in the dataset, beyond
second-order statistics. Finally, we discuss some insights on how to select MAE
hyper-parameters in practice.

Conclusion: BIRD方法通过双向时间信息传播有效解决了现有滑动窗口方法的局限性，在红外小目标检测任务中表现出色

Abstract: Moving infrared small target detection is broadly adopted in infrared search
and track systems, and has attracted considerable research focus in recent
years. The existing learning-based multi-frame methods mainly aggregate the
information of adjacent frames in a sliding window fashion to assist the
detection of the current frame. However, the sliding-window-based methods do
not consider joint optimization of the entire video clip and ignore the global
temporal information outside the sliding window, resulting in redundant
computation and sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a
Bidirectional temporal information propagation method for moving InfraRed small
target Detection, dubbed BIRD. The bidirectional propagation strategy
simultaneously utilizes local temporal information of adjacent frames and
global temporal information of past and future frames in a recursive fashion.
Specifically, in the forward and backward propagation branches, we first design
a Local Temporal Motion Fusion (LTMF) module to model local spatio-temporal
dependency between a target frame and its two adjacent frames. Then, a Global
Temporal Motion Fusion (GTMF) module is developed to further aggregate the
global propagation feature with the local fusion feature. Finally, the
bidirectional aggregated features are fused and input into the detection head
for detection. In addition, the entire video clip is jointly optimized by the
traditional detection loss and the additional Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF)
loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed BIRD method not only
achieves the state-of-the-art performance but also shows a fast inference
speed.

Abstract: Conventional car damage inspection techniques are labor-intensive, manual,
and frequently overlook tiny surface imperfections like microscopic dents.
Machine learning provides an innovative solution to the increasing demand for
quicker and more precise inspection methods. The paper uses the YOLOv8 object
recognition framework to provide a deep learning-based solution for
automatically detecting microscopic surface flaws, notably tiny dents, on car
exteriors. Traditional automotive damage inspection procedures are manual,
time-consuming, and frequently unreliable at detecting tiny flaws. To solve
this, a bespoke dataset containing annotated photos of car surfaces under
various lighting circumstances, angles, and textures was created. To improve
robustness, the YOLOv8m model and its customized variants, YOLOv8m-t4 and
YOLOv8m-t42, were trained employing real-time data augmentation approaches.
Experimental results show that the technique has excellent detection accuracy
and low inference latency, making it suited for real-time applications such as
automated insurance evaluations and automobile inspections. Evaluation
parameters such as mean Average Precision (mAP), precision, recall, and
F1-score verified the model's efficacy. With a precision of 0.86, recall of
0.84, and F1-score of 0.85, the YOLOv8m-t42 model outperformed the YOLOv8m-t4
model (precision: 0.81, recall: 0.79, F1-score: 0.80) in identifying
microscopic surface defects. With a little reduced mAP@0.5:0.95 of 0.20, the
mAP@0.5 for YOLOv8m-t42 stabilized at 0.60. Furthermore, YOLOv8m-t42's PR curve
area was 0.88, suggesting more consistent performance than YOLOv8m-t4 (0.82).
YOLOv8m-t42 has greater accuracy and is more appropriate for practical dent
detection applications, even though its convergence is slower.

*Yogesh Kumar,Uday Agarwal,Manish Gupta,Anand Mishra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MATR模型通过双阶段序列对齐和自监督预训练，在视频到视频时刻检索任务中实现了显著的性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频到视频时刻检索需要解决语义帧级对齐和复杂依赖关系建模的挑战，现有方法难以精确捕捉查询视频和目标视频之间的语义和时间关联

Method: 提出基于Transformer的MATR模型，采用双阶段序列对齐机制编码查询和目标视频的相关性，结合前景/背景分类和边界预测头，并使用自监督预训练技术进行任务特定初始化

Result: 在ActivityNet-VRL数据集上R@1提升13.1%，mIoU提升8.1%；在新提出的SportsMoments数据集上R@1提升14.7%，mIoU提升14.4%

Conclusion: MATR通过有效的序列对齐和自监督预训练，显著提升了视频到视频时刻检索的性能，为解决该任务的挑战提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Video-to-video moment retrieval (Vid2VidMR) is the task of localizing unseen
events or moments in a target video using a query video. This task poses
several challenges, such as the need for semantic frame-level alignment and
modeling complex dependencies between query and target videos. To tackle this
challenging problem, we introduce MATR (Moment Alignment TRansformer), a
transformer-based model designed to capture semantic context as well as the
temporal details necessary for precise moment localization. MATR conditions
target video representations on query video features using dual-stage sequence
alignment that encodes the required correlations and dependencies. These
representations are then used to guide foreground/background classification and
boundary prediction heads, enabling the model to accurately identify moments in
the target video that semantically match with the query video. Additionally, to
provide a strong task-specific initialization for MATR, we propose a
self-supervised pre-training technique that involves training the model to
localize random clips within videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MATR achieves notable performance improvements of 13.1% in R@1 and 8.1% in mIoU
on an absolute scale compared to state-of-the-art methods on the popular
ActivityNet-VRL dataset. Additionally, on our newly proposed dataset,
SportsMoments, MATR shows a 14.7% gain in R@1 and a 14.4% gain in mIoU on an
absolute scale over strong baselines.

TL;DR: 一种不依赖SfM的3D高斯抽射方法，能够从极稀疏视图输入中聚合估计相机姿势和重建3D场景，在仅2张训练图像下实现了显著的渲染质量提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯抽射方法依赖密集多视图输入和精确相机姿势，在极稀疏视图条件下SfM方法失败导致渲染质量下降。

Method: 提出密集立体模块进行相机姿势估计，使用一致视图插值模块生成额外监督信号，并采用多尺度拉普拉斯一致性正则化和适应性空间感知多尺度几何正则化。

Result: 在仅2张训练图像的极稀疏条件下，PSNR按提升2.75dB，综合性能显著超过现有技术，生成图像很少扭曲但保留了丰富的高频细节。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了3DGS在极稀疏视图输入下的初始化问题，为少量视图重建提供了一种更加健壮的方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable real-time
performance in novel view synthesis, yet its effectiveness relies heavily on
dense multi-view inputs with precisely known camera poses, which are rarely
available in real-world scenarios. When input views become extremely sparse,
the Structure-from-Motion (SfM) method that 3DGS depends on for initialization
fails to accurately reconstruct the 3D geometric structures of scenes,
resulting in degraded rendering quality. In this paper, we propose a novel
SfM-free 3DGS-based method that jointly estimates camera poses and reconstructs
3D scenes from extremely sparse-view inputs. Specifically, instead of SfM, we
propose a dense stereo module to progressively estimates camera pose
information and reconstructs a global dense point cloud for initialization. To
address the inherent problem of information scarcity in extremely sparse-view
settings, we propose a coherent view interpolation module that interpolates
camera poses based on training view pairs and generates viewpoint-consistent
content as additional supervision signals for training. Furthermore, we
introduce multi-scale Laplacian consistent regularization and adaptive
spatial-aware multi-scale geometry regularization to enhance the quality of
geometrical structures and rendered content. Experiments show that our method
significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art 3DGS-based approaches,
achieving a remarkable 2.75dB improvement in PSNR under extremely sparse-view
conditions (using only 2 training views). The images synthesized by our method
exhibit minimal distortion while preserving rich high-frequency details,
resulting in superior visual quality compared to existing techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有轻量级模型在医学图像分割中性能与效率的权衡问题，特别是缺乏全局上下文感知能力和通道冗余问题

Method: 采用异构层内卷积核提取局部高频信息并缓解通道冗余，集成稀疏Transformer-卷积混合分支捕获低频全局信息

Result: 在六个公共数据集上超越现有最先进方法，在四个未见数据集上保持优异的零样本泛化性能

Conclusion: LGMSNet在资源受限的医疗场景中具有实际部署潜力，为轻量级医学图像分割提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a pivotal role in disease diagnosis and
treatment planning, particularly in resource-constrained clinical settings
where lightweight and generalizable models are urgently needed. However,
existing lightweight models often compromise performance for efficiency and
rarely adopt computationally expensive attention mechanisms, severely
restricting their global contextual perception capabilities. Additionally,
current architectures neglect the channel redundancy issue under the same
convolutional kernels in medical imaging, which hinders effective feature
extraction. To address these challenges, we propose LGMSNet, a novel
lightweight framework based on local and global dual multiscale that achieves
state-of-the-art performance with minimal computational overhead. LGMSNet
employs heterogeneous intra-layer kernels to extract local high-frequency
information while mitigating channel redundancy. In addition, the model
integrates sparse transformer-convolutional hybrid branches to capture
low-frequency global information. Extensive experiments across six public
datasets demonstrate LGMSNet's superiority over existing state-of-the-art
methods. In particular, LGMSNet maintains exceptional performance in zero-shot
generalization tests on four unseen datasets, underscoring its potential for
real-world deployment in resource-limited medical scenarios. The whole project
code is in https://github.com/cq-dong/LGMSNet.

TL;DR: MExECON是一个从稀疏多视角RGB图像进行3D穿衣人体重建的新方法，通过多视角联合优化提升了几何和姿态估计精度，无需重新训练网络。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的单视角方法ECON在3D人体重建方面表现良好，但多视角信息未被充分利用。MExECON旨在扩展ECON的能力，利用多视角图像来提升重建质量和一致性。

Method: 提出联合多视角身体优化(JMBO)算法，在所有输入视角上联合拟合单个SMPL-X身体模型，确保多视角一致性。优化后的身体模型作为低频先验指导后续表面重建，通过法线图积分添加几何细节，并整合前后视角的法线图来捕捉精细表面细节。

Result: 实验结果表明，MExECON相比单视角基线方法在保真度方面持续提升，与现代少样本3D重建方法相比具有竞争力。

Conclusion: MExECON成功实现了从稀疏多视角RGB图像的高质量3D穿衣人体重建，通过多视角联合优化显著提升了重建质量，且无需额外的网络训练。

Abstract: This work presents MExECON, a novel pipeline for 3D reconstruction of clothed
human avatars from sparse multi-view RGB images. Building on the single-view
method ECON, MExECON extends its capabilities to leverage multiple viewpoints,
improving geometry and body pose estimation. At the core of the pipeline is the
proposed Joint Multi-view Body Optimization (JMBO) algorithm, which fits a
single SMPL-X body model jointly across all input views, enforcing multi-view
consistency. The optimized body model serves as a low-frequency prior that
guides the subsequent surface reconstruction, where geometric details are added
via normal map integration. MExECON integrates normal maps from both front and
back views to accurately capture fine-grained surface details such as clothing
folds and hairstyles. All multi-view gains are achieved without requiring any
network re-training. Experimental results show that MExECON consistently
improves fidelity over the single-view baseline and achieves competitive
performance compared to modern few-shot 3D reconstruction methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态图像融合方法面临模态不对齐、高频细节破坏和任务特定限制等挑战，需要一种通用的融合框架来克服这些限制。

Method: 提出AdaSFFuse框架，包含自适应近似小波变换(AdaWAT)进行频率解耦，以及空间-频率Mamba块进行高效多模态融合，实现跨域协同学习。

Result: 在红外-可见光、多焦点、多曝光和医学图像融合四个任务上的广泛实验表明，AdaSFFuse具有优越的融合性能，同时保持低计算成本和紧凑网络结构。

Conclusion: AdaSFFuse通过创新的频率解耦和跨域融合机制，在多模态图像融合中实现了性能与效率的良好平衡，为通用融合任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Image Fusion (MMIF) aims to integrate complementary information
from different imaging modalities to overcome the limitations of individual
sensors. It enhances image quality and facilitates downstream applications such
as remote sensing, medical diagnostics, and robotics. Despite significant
advancements, current MMIF methods still face challenges such as modality
misalignment, high-frequency detail destruction, and task-specific limitations.
To address these challenges, we propose AdaSFFuse, a novel framework for
task-generalized MMIF through adaptive cross-domain co-fusion learning.
AdaSFFuse introduces two key innovations: the Adaptive Approximate Wavelet
Transform (AdaWAT) for frequency decoupling, and the Spatial-Frequency Mamba
Blocks for efficient multimodal fusion. AdaWAT adaptively separates the high-
and low-frequency components of multimodal images from different scenes,
enabling fine-grained extraction and alignment of distinct frequency
characteristics for each modality. The Spatial-Frequency Mamba Blocks
facilitate cross-domain fusion in both spatial and frequency domains, enhancing
this process. These blocks dynamically adjust through learnable mappings to
ensure robust fusion across diverse modalities. By combining these components,
AdaSFFuse improves the alignment and integration of multimodal features,
reduces frequency loss, and preserves critical details. Extensive experiments
on four MMIF tasks -- Infrared-Visible Image Fusion (IVF), Multi-Focus Image
Fusion (MFF), Multi-Exposure Image Fusion (MEF), and Medical Image Fusion (MIF)
-- demonstrate AdaSFFuse's superior fusion performance, ensuring both low
computational cost and a compact network, offering a strong balance between
performance and efficiency. The code will be publicly available at
https://github.com/Zhen-yu-Liu/AdaSFFuse.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法利用生成先验作为伪真值，但往往导致几何一致性差和渲染过度平滑的问题，需要一种能够同时保持几何准确性和视觉真实性的解决方案。

Method: 提出Road Surface Gaussian(RSG)混合高斯-SDF表示和Far Field Gaussians(FFG)处理远距离物体，开发基于球谐函数的自监督不确定性估计框架，选择性整合生成先验。

Result: 在多个数据集、多样化多相机设置和各种生成先验上的实验表明，ExtraGS显著提升了外推视图的真实性和几何一致性，同时在原始轨迹上保持高保真度。

Conclusion: ExtraGS通过整合几何和生成先验的创新方法，有效解决了自动驾驶场景外推中的关键挑战，为模拟驾驶场景提供了更高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Synthesizing extrapolated views from recorded driving logs is critical for
simulating driving scenes for autonomous driving vehicles, yet it remains a
challenging task. Recent methods leverage generative priors as pseudo ground
truth, but often lead to poor geometric consistency and over-smoothed
renderings. To address these limitations, we propose ExtraGS, a holistic
framework for trajectory extrapolation that integrates both geometric and
generative priors. At the core of ExtraGS is a novel Road Surface Gaussian(RSG)
representation based on a hybrid Gaussian-Signed Distance Function (SDF)
design, and Far Field Gaussians (FFG) that use learnable scaling factors to
efficiently handle distant objects. Furthermore, we develop a self-supervised
uncertainty estimation framework based on spherical harmonics that enables
selective integration of generative priors only where extrapolation artifacts
occur. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, diverse multi-camera setups,
and various generative priors demonstrate that ExtraGS significantly enhances
the realism and geometric consistency of extrapolated views, while preserving
high fidelity along the original trajectory.

TL;DR: GroupSketch是一种新颖的矢量草图动画方法，通过两阶段流程（运动初始化和运动细化）有效处理多对象交互和复杂运动，解决了现有方法在时间一致性和泛化能力方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有草图动画方法在处理多对象交互和复杂运动时存在困难，要么仅限于单对象情况，要么存在时间不一致性和泛化能力差的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：1）运动初始化阶段交互式分割语义组并定义关键帧，通过插值生成粗略动画；2）运动细化阶段使用基于组的位移网络（GDN）预测组特定位移场，并利用文本到视频模型的先验知识，包含上下文条件特征增强（CCFE）等专门模块来提高时间一致性。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在生成复杂多对象草图的高质量、时间一致动画方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GroupSketch方法扩展了草图动画的实际应用范围，为处理复杂多对象交互提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce GroupSketch, a novel method for vector sketch animation that
effectively handles multi-object interactions and complex motions. Existing
approaches struggle with these scenarios, either being limited to single-object
cases or suffering from temporal inconsistency and poor generalization. To
address these limitations, our method adopts a two-stage pipeline comprising
Motion Initialization and Motion Refinement. In the first stage, the input
sketch is interactively divided into semantic groups and key frames are
defined, enabling the generation of a coarse animation via interpolation. In
the second stage, we propose a Group-based Displacement Network (GDN), which
refines the coarse animation by predicting group-specific displacement fields,
leveraging priors from a text-to-video model. GDN further incorporates
specialized modules, such as Context-conditioned Feature Enhancement (CCFE), to
improve temporal consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality,
temporally consistent animations for complex, multi-object sketches, thus
expanding the practical applications of sketch animation.

TL;DR: D3FNet是一种用于高分辨率遥感图像中细粒度窄路分割的网络，通过差分注意力扩张提取、双流解码融合和多尺度扩张策略，有效解决了窄路宽度有限、拓扑碎片化和遮挡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率遥感图像中的窄路提取面临宽度有限、拓扑碎片化和频繁遮挡等挑战，传统模型容易过拟合到通用道路宽度，无法有效处理细粒度、遮挡和低对比度的路段。

Method: 基于D-LinkNet编码器-解码器架构，提出三个关键创新：1)差分注意力扩张提取模块增强细粒度道路特征；2)双流解码融合机制平衡空间精度和语义上下文；3)多尺度扩张策略减少网格伪影并改善连续性。

Result: 在DeepGlobe和CHN6-CUG基准测试中，D3FNet在具有挑战性的道路区域实现了优越的IoU和召回率，超越了最先进的基线方法。消融研究验证了注意力引导编码和双路径解码的互补协同作用。

Conclusion: D3FNet被证实为复杂遥感和协同感知场景中细粒度窄路提取的鲁棒解决方案，特别适用于处理细粒度、遮挡和低对比度的道路段。

Abstract: Extracting narrow roads from high-resolution remote sensing imagery remains a
significant challenge due to their limited width, fragmented topology, and
frequent occlusions. To address these issues, we propose D3FNet, a Dilated
Dual-Stream Differential Attention Fusion Network designed for fine-grained
road structure segmentation in remote perception systems. Built upon the
encoder-decoder backbone of D-LinkNet, D3FNet introduces three key
innovations:(1) a Differential Attention Dilation Extraction (DADE) module that
enhances subtle road features while suppressing background noise at the
bottleneck; (2) a Dual-stream Decoding Fusion Mechanism (DDFM) that integrates
original and attention-modulated features to balance spatial precision with
semantic context; and (3) a multi-scale dilation strategy (rates 1, 3, 5, 9)
that mitigates gridding artifacts and improves continuity in narrow road
prediction. Unlike conventional models that overfit to generic road widths,
D3FNet specifically targets fine-grained, occluded, and low-contrast road
segments. Extensive experiments on the DeepGlobe and CHN6-CUG benchmarks show
that D3FNet achieves superior IoU and recall on challenging road regions,
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies further verify the
complementary synergy of attention-guided encoding and dual-path decoding.
These results confirm D3FNet as a robust solution for fine-grained narrow road
extraction in complex remote and cooperative perception scenarios.

Motivation: 现有测试时自适应方法存在两个主要问题：1）依赖反向传播或迭代优化，限制了可扩展性和实时部署；2）缺乏对类别条件特征分布的显式建模，影响决策边界可靠性和预测校准。

Method: 将TTA重构为高斯概率推理任务，使用逐渐更新的类别均值和共享协方差矩阵建模类别条件似然，实现闭式、无训练推理。引入CLIP先验和历史知识库指导的轻量级正则化来纠正可能存在的似然偏差。

Conclusion: ADAPT方法无需源数据、梯度更新或完整访问目标数据，支持在线和转导设置，为测试时自适应提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) enhances the zero-shot robustness under
distribution shifts by leveraging unlabeled test data during inference. Despite
notable advances, several challenges still limit its broader applicability.
First, most methods rely on backpropagation or iterative optimization, which
limits scalability and hinders real-time deployment. Second, they lack explicit
modeling of class-conditional feature distributions. This modeling is crucial
for producing reliable decision boundaries and calibrated predictions, but it
remains underexplored due to the lack of both source data and supervision at
test time. In this paper, we propose ADAPT, an Advanced Distribution-Aware and
backPropagation-free Test-time adaptation method. We reframe TTA as a Gaussian
probabilistic inference task by modeling class-conditional likelihoods using
gradually updated class means and a shared covariance matrix. This enables
closed-form, training-free inference. To correct potential likelihood bias, we
introduce lightweight regularization guided by CLIP priors and a historical
knowledge bank. ADAPT requires no source data, no gradient updates, and no full
access to target data, supporting both online and transductive settings.
Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance under a wide range of distribution shifts
with superior scalability and robustness.

Motivation: 隐式神经表示(INRs)存在频谱偏置问题，倾向于学习低频分量而难以捕捉高频细节如锐利边缘和精细纹理

Method: 采用两阶段训练策略：第一阶段使用邻居感知软掩码自适应地为局部变化强烈的像素分配更高权重，引导模型早期关注细节；第二阶段进行全图像训练

Result: 实验结果表明该方法能持续提升重建质量，并与现有INR方法互补

Conclusion: 作为首个在图像INR中为像素分配频率感知重要性的尝试，为缓解频谱偏置问题提供了新途径

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful alternative
to traditional pixel-based formats by modeling images as continuous functions
over spatial coordinates. A key challenge, however, lies in the spectral bias
of neural networks, which tend to favor low-frequency components while
struggling to capture high-frequency (HF) details such as sharp edges and fine
textures. While prior approaches have addressed this limitation through
architectural modifications or specialized activation functions, we propose an
orthogonal direction by directly guiding the training process. Specifically, we
introduce a two-stage training strategy where a neighbor-aware soft mask
adaptively assigns higher weights to pixels with strong local variations,
encouraging early focus on fine details. The model then transitions to
full-image training. Experimental results show that our approach consistently
improves reconstruction quality and complements existing INR methods. As a
pioneering attempt to assign frequency-aware importance to pixels in image INR,
our work offers a new avenue for mitigating the spectral bias problem.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了点云配准的计算效率，虽然目前仅适用于旋转轴已知的情况，但为全局最优求解提供了新的有效途径

Abstract: Recent results showed that point cloud registration with given
correspondences can be made robust to outlier rates of up to 95\% using the
truncated least squares (TLS) formulation. However, solving this combinatorial
optimization problem to global optimality is challenging. Provably globally
optimal approaches using semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations take
hundreds of seconds for 100 points. In this paper, we propose a novel linear
time convex relaxation as well as a contractor method to speed up Branch and
Bound (BnB). Our solver can register two 3D point clouds with 100 points to
provable global optimality in less than half a second when the axis of rotation
is provided. Although it currently cannot solve the full 6DoF problem, it is
two orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art SDP solver STRIDE when
solving the rotation-only TLS problem. In addition to providing a formal proof
for global optimality, we present empirical evidence of global optimality using
adversarial instances with local minimas close to the global minimum.

Abstract: Wildlife and human activities are key components of landscape systems.
Understanding their spatial distribution is essential for evaluating human
wildlife interactions and informing effective conservation planning.
Multiperspective monitoring of wildlife and human activities by combining
camera traps and drone imagery. Capturing the spatial patterns of their
distributions, which allows the identification of the overlap of their activity
zones and the assessment of the degree of human wildlife conflict. The study
was conducted in Chitwan National Park (CNP), Nepal, and adjacent regions.
Images collected by visible and nearinfrared camera traps and thermal infrared
drones from February to July 2022 were processed to create training and testing
datasets, which were used to build deep learning models to automatic identify
wildlife and human activities. Drone collected thermal imagery was used for
detecting targets to provide a multiple monitoring perspective. Spatial pattern
analysis was performed to identify animal and resident activity hotspots and
delineation potential human wildlife conflict zones. Among the deep learning
models tested, YOLOv11s achieved the highest performance with a precision of
96.2%, recall of 92.3%, mAP50 of 96.7%, and mAP50 of 81.3%, making it the most
effective for detecting objects in camera trap imagery. Drone based thermal
imagery, analyzed with an enhanced Faster RCNN model, added a complementary
aerial viewpoint for camera trap detections. Spatial pattern analysis
identified clear hotspots for both wildlife and human activities and their
overlapping patterns within certain areas in the CNP and buffer zones

*Pengcheng Fang,Yuxia Chen,Rui Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Grounded VideoDiT是一个视频大语言模型，通过扩散时间潜在编码器、对象接地表示和混合令牌方案，显著提升了视频时间感知和实体交互的精确度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频LLM在时间感知方面存在不足：时间戳编码隐式、帧级特征连续性弱、语言视觉对齐容易漂移，需要更精确的时间定位和实体交互能力。

Method: 1. 扩散时间潜在（DTL）编码器增强边界敏感性和时间一致性
2. 对象接地表示显式绑定查询实体到局部视觉证据
3. 混合令牌方案使用离散时间令牌进行显式时间戳建模

Result: 在Charades STA、NExT GQA和多个VideoQA基准测试中取得了最先进的结果

Conclusion: Grounded VideoDiT通过三项关键创新设计，为视频LLM提供了强大的接地能力，实现了精细的时间推理和实体交互理解。

Abstract: Understanding videos requires more than answering open ended questions, it
demands the ability to pinpoint when events occur and how entities interact
across time. While recent Video LLMs have achieved remarkable progress in
holistic reasoning, they remain coarse in temporal perception: timestamps are
encoded only implicitly, frame level features are weak in capturing continuity,
and language vision alignment often drifts from the entities of interest. In
this paper, we present Grounded VideoDiT, a Video LLM designed to overcome
these limitations by introducing three key innovations. First, a Diffusion
Temporal Latent (DTL) encoder enhances boundary sensitivity and maintains
temporal consistency. Second, object grounded representations explicitly bind
query entities to localized visual evidence, strengthening alignment. Third, a
mixed token scheme with discrete temporal tokens provides explicit timestamp
modeling, enabling fine grained temporal reasoning. Together, these designs
equip Grounded VideoDiT with robust grounding capabilities, as validated by
state of the art results on Charades STA, NExT GQA, and multiple VideoQA
benchmarks.

TL;DR: 基于人工评分和评分模型的弱监督方法，提升机载充满刻扫数据的树木实例分割性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机载充满刻扫数据树木分割中的数据变异性问题，以及获取精确标签训练数据成本高的挑战

Method: 通过人工质量评价创建评分标签，训练评分模型分类分割输出，然后利用评分模型的反馈微调分割模型

Result: 方法将原始分割模型的正确识别树木实例数量提升了34%，同时大幅减少了非树木实例的预测数量

Conclusion: 该弱监督方法有效提升了树木分割性能，但在疏林区域小树和复杂环境中仍面临挑战

Abstract: Tree instance segmentation of airborne laser scanning (ALS) data is of utmost
importance for forest monitoring, but remains challenging due to variations in
the data caused by factors such as sensor resolution, vegetation state at
acquisition time, terrain characteristics, etc. Moreover, obtaining a
sufficient amount of precisely labeled data to train fully supervised instance
segmentation methods is expensive. To address these challenges, we propose a
weakly supervised approach where labels of an initial segmentation result
obtained either by a non-finetuned model or a closed form algorithm are
provided as a quality rating by a human operator. The labels produced during
the quality assessment are then used to train a rating model, whose task is to
classify a segmentation output into the same classes as specified by the human
operator. Finally, the segmentation model is finetuned using feedback from the
rating model. This in turn improves the original segmentation model by 34\% in
terms of correctly identified tree instances while considerably reducing the
number of non-tree instances predicted. Challenges still remain in data over
sparsely forested regions characterized by small trees (less than two meters in
height) or within complex surroundings containing shrubs, boulders, etc. which
can be confused as trees where the performance of the proposed method is
reduced.

TL;DR: 提出CFG方法，通过关键特征引导提升3D点云对抗样本的迁移性，在黑盒攻击场景下无需目标模型信息即可生成有效对抗样本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中难以获取目标模型信息，现有3D对抗攻击方法依赖模型参数或输出信息，需要开发不依赖目标模型信息的迁移攻击方法

Method: 基于关键特征一致性观察，通过计算特征重要性来指导对抗点云搜索，优先破坏不同架构可能采用的关键特征，并在损失函数中约束最大偏差以确保不可感知性

Result: 在ModelNet40和ScanObjectNN基准数据集上的大量实验表明，CFG方法大幅优于现有最先进的攻击方法

Conclusion: CFG方法通过关键特征引导有效提升了3D点云对抗样本的迁移攻击能力，为黑盒场景下的3D点云安全提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Deep neural networks for 3D point clouds have been demonstrated to be
vulnerable to adversarial examples. Previous 3D adversarial attack methods
often exploit certain information about the target models, such as model
parameters or outputs, to generate adversarial point clouds. However, in
realistic scenarios, it is challenging to obtain any information about the
target models under conditions of absolute security. Therefore, we focus on
transfer-based attacks, where generating adversarial point clouds does not
require any information about the target models. Based on our observation that
the critical features used for point cloud classification are consistent across
different DNN architectures, we propose CFG, a novel transfer-based black-box
attack method that improves the transferability of adversarial point clouds via
the proposed Critical Feature Guidance. Specifically, our method regularizes
the search of adversarial point clouds by computing the importance of the
extracted features, prioritizing the corruption of critical features that are
likely to be adopted by diverse architectures. Further, we explicitly constrain
the maximum deviation extent of the generated adversarial point clouds in the
loss function to ensure their imperceptibility. Extensive experiments conducted
on the ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN benchmark datasets demonstrate that the
proposed CFG outperforms the state-of-the-art attack methods by a large margin.

Conclusion: MapKD框架成功实现了从多模态模型到视觉模型的跨模态知识转移，为自动驾驶系统提供了高效低成本的在线地图构建方案

Abstract: Online HD map construction is a fundamental task in autonomous driving
systems, aiming to acquire semantic information of map elements around the ego
vehicle based on real-time sensor inputs. Recently, several approaches have
achieved promising results by incorporating offline priors such as SD maps and
HD maps or by fusing multi-modal data. However, these methods depend on stale
offline maps and multi-modal sensor suites, resulting in avoidable
computational overhead at inference. To address these limitations, we employ a
knowledge distillation strategy to transfer knowledge from multimodal models
with prior knowledge to an efficient, low-cost, and vision-centric student
model. Specifically, we propose MapKD, a novel multi-level cross-modal
knowledge distillation framework with an innovative Teacher-Coach-Student (TCS)
paradigm. This framework consists of: (1) a camera-LiDAR fusion model with
SD/HD map priors serving as the teacher; (2) a vision-centric coach model with
prior knowledge and simulated LiDAR to bridge the cross-modal knowledge
transfer gap; and (3) a lightweight vision-based student model. Additionally,
we introduce two targeted knowledge distillation strategies: Token-Guided 2D
Patch Distillation (TGPD) for bird's eye view feature alignment and Masked
Semantic Response Distillation (MSRD) for semantic learning guidance. Extensive
experiments on the challenging nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MapKD improves
the student model by +6.68 mIoU and +10.94 mAP while simultaneously
accelerating inference speed. The code is available

TL;DR: MDPR框架通过多维度动态提示路由解决VLM在类别不平衡场景下的微调偏差问题，在多个长尾基准测试中达到SOTA水平


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练视觉语言模型在类别不平衡场景下微调时存在偏差，现有方法忽略了VLM预训练中固有的类别不平衡问题，导致下游任务中的偏差积累

Method: 提出多维度动态提示路由(MDPR)框架，构建跨越五个视觉语义维度的综合知识库，通过动态路由机制对齐全局视觉类别、检索最优提示、平衡细粒度语义，并通过logits融合产生稳定预测

Result: 在CIFAR-LT、ImageNet-LT和Places-LT等长尾基准测试中取得了与当前SOTA方法相当的结果，消融研究证实了语义库对尾部类别的有效性，动态路由计算开销极小

Conclusion: MDPR为数据不平衡下的VLM微调提供了一个灵活高效的增强方案，能够有效缓解类别不平衡带来的偏差问题

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
impressive capability in visual tasks, but their fine-tuning often suffers from
bias in class-imbalanced scene. Recent works have introduced large language
models (LLMs) to enhance VLM fine-tuning with supplementing semantic
information. However, they often overlook inherent class imbalance in VLMs'
pre-training, which may lead to bias accumulation in downstream tasks. To
address this problem, this paper proposes a Multi-dimensional Dynamic Prompt
Routing (MDPR) framework. MDPR constructs a comprehensive knowledge base for
classes, spanning five visual-semantic dimensions. During fine-tuning, the
dynamic routing mechanism aligns global visual classes, retrieves optimal
prompts, and balances fine-grained semantics, yielding stable predictions
through logits fusion. Extensive experiments on long-tailed benchmarks,
including CIFAR-LT, ImageNet-LT, and Places-LT, demonstrate that MDPR achieves
comparable results with current SOTA methods. Ablation studies further confirm
the effectiveness of our semantic library for tail classes, and show that our
dynamic routing incurs minimal computational overhead, making MDPR a flexible
and efficient enhancement for VLM fine-tuning under data imbalance.

TL;DR: StreamMem是一种查询无关的KV缓存内存机制，用于流式视频理解，通过注意力分数压缩视觉token和通用查询token之间的KV缓存，在内存受限的长视频场景中实现高效问答。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在处理长视频时存在内存和计算开销大的问题，现有视觉压缩方法需要预先编码整个视觉上下文或提前获取问题，这在长视频理解和多轮对话场景中不实用。

Method: 提出StreamMem方法，以流式方式编码新视频帧，使用视觉token和通用查询token之间的注意力分数压缩KV缓存，并维持固定大小的KV内存。

Result: 在三个长视频理解和两个流式视频问答基准测试中，StreamMem在查询无关的KV缓存压缩方面达到最先进性能，并与查询感知压缩方法具有竞争力。

Conclusion: StreamMem为长视频流式理解提供了一种高效的查询无关KV缓存压缩解决方案，在内存受限环境下表现出色。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in
visual-language reasoning, but their ability to efficiently handle long videos
remains limited. Despite recent advances in long-context MLLMs, storing and
attending to the key-value (KV) cache for long visual contexts incurs
substantial memory and computational overhead. Existing visual compression
methods require either encoding the entire visual context before compression or
having access to the questions in advance, which is impractical for long video
understanding and multi-turn conversational settings. In this work, we propose
StreamMem, a query-agnostic KV cache memory mechanism for streaming video
understanding. Specifically, StreamMem encodes new video frames in a streaming
manner, compressing the KV cache using attention scores between visual tokens
and generic query tokens, while maintaining a fixed-size KV memory to enable
efficient question answering (QA) in memory-constrained, long-video scenarios.
Evaluation on three long video understanding and two streaming video question
answering benchmarks shows that StreamMem achieves state-of-the-art performance
in query-agnostic KV cache compression and is competitive with query-aware
compression approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成视频建模方法主要依赖RGB信号，导致在长序列中对象结构和运动出现累积错误，需要解决时间一致性和结构保持的问题。

Method: 提出统一的长时域建模方案，联合预测感知条件和颜色信息；利用深度线索构建记忆库保持上下文信息；采用分段噪声调度训练预测组。

Result: 在扩散模型和整流流模型上的大量实验表明，WorldWeaver能有效减少时间漂移并提高生成视频的保真度。

Conclusion: WorldWeaver通过联合建模RGB和感知条件、利用深度线索和分段噪声调度，显著提升了长视频生成的时间一致性和质量。

Abstract: Generative video modeling has made significant strides, yet ensuring
structural and temporal consistency over long sequences remains a challenge.
Current methods predominantly rely on RGB signals, leading to accumulated
errors in object structure and motion over extended durations. To address these
issues, we introduce WorldWeaver, a robust framework for long video generation
that jointly models RGB frames and perceptual conditions within a unified
long-horizon modeling scheme. Our training framework offers three key
advantages. First, by jointly predicting perceptual conditions and color
information from a unified representation, it significantly enhances temporal
consistency and motion dynamics. Second, by leveraging depth cues, which we
observe to be more resistant to drift than RGB, we construct a memory bank that
preserves clearer contextual information, improving quality in long-horizon
video generation. Third, we employ segmented noise scheduling for training
prediction groups, which further mitigates drift and reduces computational
cost. Extensive experiments on both diffusion- and rectified flow-based models
demonstrate the effectiveness of WorldWeaver in reducing temporal drift and
improving the fidelity of generated videos.

Motivation: 现有的视觉基础模型（如SAM）在计算病理学中虽能进行核分割，但在细粒度语义分割（如识别特定核亚型或特定细胞）方面存在挑战，需要更精确的模型来处理病理图像分析。

Method: 采用全栈方法：1）通过分子赋能的标注减少像素级标注需求；2）使用SAM适配器调整模型以强调特定语义；3）整合分子导向的校正学习（MOCL）来提升分割精度。

Result: 在内部和公共数据集上的实验表明，All-in-SAM模型显著提高了细胞分类性能，即使在标注质量不同的情况下也能保持良好效果。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅减轻了标注人员的工作负担，还将精确的生物医学图像分析扩展到资源有限的环境中，推动了医学诊断和病理图像分析的自动化。

Abstract: Purpose: Recent developments in computational pathology have been driven by
advances in Vision Foundation Models, particularly the Segment Anything Model
(SAM). This model facilitates nuclei segmentation through two primary methods:
prompt-based zero-shot segmentation and the use of cell-specific SAM models for
direct segmentation. These approaches enable effective segmentation across a
range of nuclei and cells. However, general vision foundation models often face
challenges with fine-grained semantic segmentation, such as identifying
specific nuclei subtypes or particular cells. Approach: In this paper, we
propose the molecular-empowered All-in-SAM Model to advance computational
pathology by leveraging the capabilities of vision foundation models. This
model incorporates a full-stack approach, focusing on: (1) annotation-engaging
lay annotators through molecular-empowered learning to reduce the need for
detailed pixel-level annotations, (2) learning-adapting the SAM model to
emphasize specific semantics, which utilizes its strong generalizability with
SAM adapter, and (3) refinement-enhancing segmentation accuracy by integrating
Molecular-Oriented Corrective Learning (MOCL). Results: Experimental results
from both in-house and public datasets show that the All-in-SAM model
significantly improves cell classification performance, even when faced with
varying annotation quality. Conclusions: Our approach not only reduces the
workload for annotators but also extends the accessibility of precise
biomedical image analysis to resource-limited settings, thereby advancing
medical diagnostics and automating pathology image analysis.

Abstract: We present Waver, a high-performance foundation model for unified image and
video generation. Waver can directly generate videos with durations ranging
from 5 to 10 seconds at a native resolution of 720p, which are subsequently
upscaled to 1080p. The model simultaneously supports text-to-video (T2V),

quality, we establish a comprehensive data curation pipeline and manually
annotate and train an MLLM-based video quality model to filter for the
highest-quality samples. Furthermore, we provide detailed training and
inference recipes to facilitate the generation of high-quality videos. Building

Motivation: 现有参数化人体模型在捕捉多样化姿态和形状的细节变化方面存在困难，主要由于训练数据多样性有限和建模假设限制。传统方法先优化外部身体表面再回归内部骨骼关节，导致内部骨骼与外部软组织之间存在问题依赖关系。

Method: 从600K高分辨率扫描数据学习，使用240个同步相机捕获。显式解耦形状和骨骼基础，将网格表示基于人体骨骼。采用非线性姿态校正来更有效地捕捉复杂姿态。

Result: ATLAS在拟合未见过的多样化姿态主体方面优于现有方法，定量评估显示非线性姿态校正比线性模型更有效地捕捉复杂姿态。

Conclusion: 通过解耦形状和骨骼表示，ATLAS实现了增强的形状表达能力、细粒度身体属性定制以及独立于外部软组织特征的关键点拟合，为高保真人体建模提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Parametric body models offer expressive 3D representation of humans across a
wide range of poses, shapes, and facial expressions, typically derived by
learning a basis over registered 3D meshes. However, existing human mesh
modeling approaches struggle to capture detailed variations across diverse body
poses and shapes, largely due to limited training data diversity and
restrictive modeling assumptions. Moreover, the common paradigm first optimizes
the external body surface using a linear basis, then regresses internal
skeletal joints from surface vertices. This approach introduces problematic
dependencies between internal skeleton and outer soft tissue, limiting direct
control over body height and bone lengths. To address these issues, we present
ATLAS, a high-fidelity body model learned from 600k high-resolution scans
captured using 240 synchronized cameras. Unlike previous methods, we explicitly
decouple the shape and skeleton bases by grounding our mesh representation in
the human skeleton. This decoupling enables enhanced shape expressivity,
fine-grained customization of body attributes, and keypoint fitting independent
of external soft-tissue characteristics. ATLAS outperforms existing methods by
fitting unseen subjects in diverse poses more accurately, and quantitative
evaluations show that our non-linear pose correctives more effectively capture
complex poses compared to linear models.

Abstract: 3D content generation has recently attracted significant research interest
due to its applications in VR/AR and embodied AI. In this work, we address the
challenging task of synthesizing multiple 3D assets within a single scene
image. Concretely, our contributions are fourfold: (i) we present SceneGen, a
novel framework that takes a scene image and corresponding object masks as
input, simultaneously producing multiple 3D assets with geometry and texture.
Notably, SceneGen operates with no need for optimization or asset retrieval;
(ii) we introduce a novel feature aggregation module that integrates local and
global scene information from visual and geometric encoders within the feature
extraction module. Coupled with a position head, this enables the generation of
3D assets and their relative spatial positions in a single feedforward pass;
(iii) we demonstrate SceneGen's direct extensibility to multi-image input
scenarios. Despite being trained solely on single-image inputs, our
architectural design enables improved generation performance with multi-image
inputs; and (iv) extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations confirm the
efficiency and robust generation abilities of our approach. We believe this
paradigm offers a novel solution for high-quality 3D content generation,
potentially advancing its practical applications in downstream tasks. The code

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have brought remarkable visual fidelity
to instruction-guided image editing. However, their global denoising process
inherently entangles the edited region with the entire image context, leading
to unintended spurious modifications and compromised adherence to editing
instructions. In contrast, autoregressive models offer a distinct paradigm by
formulating image synthesis as a sequential process over discrete visual
tokens. Their causal and compositional mechanism naturally circumvents the
adherence challenges of diffusion-based methods. In this paper, we present
VAREdit, a visual autoregressive (VAR) framework that reframes image editing as
a next-scale prediction problem. Conditioned on source image features and text
instructions, VAREdit generates multi-scale target features to achieve precise
edits. A core challenge in this paradigm is how to effectively condition the
source image tokens. We observe that finest-scale source features cannot
effectively guide the prediction of coarser target features. To bridge this
gap, we introduce a Scale-Aligned Reference (SAR) module, which injects
scale-matched conditioning information into the first self-attention layer.
VAREdit demonstrates significant advancements in both editing adherence and
efficiency. On standard benchmarks, it outperforms leading diffusion-based
methods by 30\%+ higher GPT-Balance score. Moreover, it completes a
$512\times512$ editing in 1.2 seconds, making it 2.2$\times$ faster than the
similarly sized UltraEdit. The models are available at

Conclusion: CineScale成功扩展了预训练模型的高分辨率视觉生成能力，为高质量高分辨率图像和视频生成提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Visual diffusion models achieve remarkable progress, yet they are typically
trained at limited resolutions due to the lack of high-resolution data and
constrained computation resources, hampering their ability to generate
high-fidelity images or videos at higher resolutions. Recent efforts have
explored tuning-free strategies to exhibit the untapped potential
higher-resolution visual generation of pre-trained models. However, these
methods are still prone to producing low-quality visual content with repetitive
patterns. The key obstacle lies in the inevitable increase in high-frequency
information when the model generates visual content exceeding its training
resolution, leading to undesirable repetitive patterns deriving from the
accumulated errors. In this work, we propose CineScale, a novel inference
paradigm to enable higher-resolution visual generation. To tackle the various
issues introduced by the two types of video generation architectures, we
propose dedicated variants tailored to each. Unlike existing baseline methods
that are confined to high-resolution T2I and T2V generation, CineScale broadens
the scope by enabling high-resolution I2V and V2V synthesis, built atop
state-of-the-art open-source video generation frameworks. Extensive experiments
validate the superiority of our paradigm in extending the capabilities of
higher-resolution visual generation for both image and video models.
Remarkably, our approach enables 8k image generation without any fine-tuning,
and achieves 4k video generation with only minimal LoRA fine-tuning. Generated

Abstract: Advancements in diffusion-based foundation models have improved text-to-image
generation, yet most efforts have been limited to low-resolution settings. As
high-resolution image synthesis becomes increasingly essential for various
applications, particularly in medical imaging domains, fine-tuning emerges as a
crucial mechanism for adapting these powerful pre-trained models to
task-specific requirements and data distributions. In this work, we present a
systematic study, examining the impact of various fine-tuning techniques on
image generation quality when scaling to high resolution 512x512 pixels. We
benchmark a diverse set of fine-tuning methods, including full fine-tuning
strategies and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). We dissect how different
fine-tuning methods influence key quality metrics, including Fr\'echet
Inception Distance (FID), Vendi score, and prompt-image alignment. We also
evaluate the utility of generated images in a downstream classification task
under data-scarce conditions, demonstrating that specific fine-tuning
strategies improve both generation fidelity and downstream performance when
synthetic images are used for classifier training and evaluation on real
images. Our code is accessible through the project website -

Conclusion: 首个开源免费的舌象分割工具，为中医从业者和研究者提供无需编程经验的解决方案

Abstract: Tongue imaging serves as a valuable diagnostic tool, particularly in
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). The quality of tongue surface segmentation
significantly affects the accuracy of tongue image classification and
subsequent diagnosis in intelligent tongue diagnosis systems. However, existing
research on tongue image segmentation faces notable limitations, and there is a
lack of robust and user-friendly segmentation tools. This paper proposes a
tongue image segmentation model (TOM) based on multi-teacher knowledge
distillation. By incorporating a novel diffusion-based data augmentation
method, we enhanced the generalization ability of the segmentation model while
reducing its parameter size. Notably, after reducing the parameter count by
96.6% compared to the teacher models, the student model still achieves an
impressive segmentation performance of 95.22% mIoU. Furthermore, we packaged
and deployed the trained model as both an online and offline segmentation tool
(available at https://itongue.cn/), allowing TCM practitioners and researchers
to use it without any programming experience. We also present a case study on
TCM constitution classification using segmented tongue patches. Experimental
results demonstrate that training with tongue patches yields higher
classification performance and better interpretability than original tongue
images. To our knowledge, this is the first open-source and freely available
tongue image segmentation tool.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 本研究探索了基于GAN的超分辨率方法在4D Flow MRI中的应用，特别是针对近壁速度恢复问题，发现Wasserstein GAN在稳定性和性能方面表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D Flow MRI在临床应用中受限于低空间分辨率和噪声，特别是在近壁速度测量方面。虽然机器学习超分辨率方法有潜力，但近壁速度恢复仍具挑战性。GAN在非医学超分辨率任务中表现出色，但在4D Flow MRI中的应用尚未探索。

Method: 使用患者特异性脑血管硅模型生成合成图像，通过MR真实重建管道。实现专用GAN架构，评估三种对抗损失函数：Vanilla、Relativistic和Wasserstein GAN。

Result: 提出的GAN相比非对抗参考改善了近壁速度恢复（vNRMSE: 6.9% vs. 9.6%）。Wasserstein GAN表现出最佳稳定性和增量改进（vNRMSE: 6.9% vs. 7.2%），在低信噪比条件下也优于生成器基线（vNRMSE: 8.7% vs. 10.7%）。

Conclusion: GAN-based超分辨率在增强4D Flow MRI方面具有潜力，特别是在具有挑战性的脑血管区域，但需要仔细选择对抗策略，Wasserstein GAN是最稳定的选择。

Abstract: 4D Flow Magnetic Resonance Imaging (4D Flow MRI) enables non-invasive
quantification of blood flow and hemodynamic parameters. However, its clinical
application is limited by low spatial resolution and noise, particularly
affecting near-wall velocity measurements. Machine learning-based
super-resolution has shown promise in addressing these limitations, but
challenges remain, not least in recovering near-wall velocities. Generative
adversarial networks (GANs) offer a compelling solution, having demonstrated
strong capabilities in restoring sharp boundaries in non-medical
super-resolution tasks. Yet, their application in 4D Flow MRI remains
unexplored, with implementation challenged by known issues such as training
instability and non-convergence. In this study, we investigate GAN-based
super-resolution in 4D Flow MRI. Training and validation were conducted using
patient-specific cerebrovascular in-silico models, converted into synthetic
images via an MR-true reconstruction pipeline. A dedicated GAN architecture was
implemented and evaluated across three adversarial loss functions: Vanilla,
Relativistic, and Wasserstein. Our results demonstrate that the proposed GAN
improved near-wall velocity recovery compared to a non-adversarial reference
(vNRMSE: 6.9% vs. 9.6%); however, that implementation specifics are critical
for stable network training. While Vanilla and Relativistic GANs proved
unstable compared to generator-only training (vNRMSE: 8.1% and 7.8% vs. 7.2%),
a Wasserstein GAN demonstrated optimal stability and incremental improvement
(vNRMSE: 6.9% vs. 7.2%). The Wasserstein GAN further outperformed the
generator-only baseline at low SNR (vNRMSE: 8.7% vs. 10.7%). These findings
highlight the potential of GAN-based super-resolution in enhancing 4D Flow MRI,
particularly in challenging cerebrovascular regions, while emphasizing the need
for careful selection of adversarial strategies.

*Paul Fischer,Jan Nikolas Morshuis,Thomas Küstner,Christian Baumgartner*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种动态的、不确定性感知的MRI采集框架，能够根据每个宜主的不确定性条件动态调整扫描时间，在保证诊断信心的前提下减少扫描时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统加速MRI采用固定加速因子，导致扫描时间要么过长要么质量不足，而深度学习重建引入的不确定性通常被忽略。需要一种能够动态调整采集过程、平衡扫描效率和诊断信心的方法。

Method: 使用概率论重建模型估计图像不确定性，通过满足预测技术将不确定性转换为精确的置信区间。在k空间采集过程中迭代地更新重建并评估置信区间，当不确定性达到用户预定精度目标时自动终止扫描。

Result: 在膝关和心脏MRI数据集上验证显示，该适应性方法能够比固定协议减少扫描时间，同时为最终图像精度提供正式的统计保证。

Conclusion: 该框架超越了固定加速因子的限制，实现了基于患者特征的个性化采集，在扫描效率和诊断信心之间取得平衡，是向个性化和资源高效MRI的关键步骤。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) offers unparalleled soft-tissue contrast but
is fundamentally limited by long acquisition times. While deep learning-based
accelerated MRI can dramatically shorten scan times, the reconstruction from
undersampled data introduces ambiguity resulting from an ill-posed problem with
infinitely many possible solutions that propagates to downstream clinical
tasks. This uncertainty is usually ignored during the acquisition process as
acceleration factors are often fixed a priori, resulting in scans that are
either unnecessarily long or of insufficient quality for a given clinical
endpoint. This work introduces a dynamic, uncertainty-aware acquisition
framework that adjusts scan time on a per-subject basis. Our method leverages a
probabilistic reconstruction model to estimate image uncertainty, which is then
propagated through a full analysis pipeline to a quantitative metric of
interest (e.g., patellar cartilage volume or cardiac ejection fraction). We use
conformal prediction to transform this uncertainty into a rigorous, calibrated
confidence interval for the metric. During acquisition, the system iteratively
samples k-space, updates the reconstruction, and evaluates the confidence
interval. The scan terminates automatically once the uncertainty meets a
user-predefined precision target. We validate our framework on both knee and
cardiac MRI datasets. Our results demonstrate that this adaptive approach
reduces scan times compared to fixed protocols while providing formal
statistical guarantees on the precision of the final image. This framework
moves beyond fixed acceleration factors, enabling patient-specific acquisitions
that balance scan efficiency with diagnostic confidence, a critical step
towards personalized and resource-efficient MRI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频流使用有损压缩和速率自适应技术，但新兴的神经形态事件传感器采用异步像素采样而非图像帧，现有研究主要关注应用开发而忽略了数据传输这一关键问题

Result: 提出了解决事件传感器数据传输问题的技术方案

Conclusion: 事件传感器视频流需要专门的压缩和传输解决方案，提出的低延迟事件流格式为解决这一问题提供了有效途径

Abstract: Lossy compression and rate-adaptive streaming are a mainstay in traditional
video steams. However, a new class of neuromorphic ``event'' sensors records
video with asynchronous pixel samples rather than image frames. These sensors
are designed for computer vision applications, rather than human video
consumption. Until now, researchers have focused their efforts primarily on
application development, ignoring the crucial problem of data transmission. We
survey the landscape of event-based video systems, discuss the technical issues
with our recent scalable event streaming work, and propose a new low-latency
event streaming format based on the latest additions to the Media Over QUIC
protocol draft.

Abstract: Medical imaging modalities including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),
computed tomography (CT), and ultrasound are essential for accurate diagnosis
and treatment planning in modern healthcare. However, noise contamination
during image acquisition and processing frequently degrades image quality,
obscuring critical diagnostic details and compromising clinical
decision-making. Additionally, enhancement techniques such as histogram
equalization may inadvertently amplify existing noise artifacts, including
salt-and-pepper distortions. This study investigates wavelet transform-based
denoising methods for effective noise mitigation in medical images, with the
primary objective of identifying optimal combinations of threshold values,
decomposition levels, and wavelet types to achieve superior denoising
performance and enhanced diagnostic accuracy. Through systematic evaluation
across various noise conditions, the research demonstrates that the bior6.8
biorthogonal wavelet with universal thresholding at decomposition levels 2-3
consistently achieves optimal denoising performance, providing significant
noise reduction while preserving essential anatomical structures and diagnostic
features critical for clinical applications.

Method: 提出SPIRiT正则化项，将压缩感知与两种并行成像方法（线性预测性和灵敏度编码）相结合

Result: 在脑部、膝盖和脚踝数据上验证了重建图像的改进效果

Conclusion: SPIRiT正则化项能有效结合压缩感知和并行成像，显著提升MRI图像重建质量

Abstract: Accelerated Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) permits high quality images from
fewer samples that can be collected with a faster scan. Two established methods
for accelerating MRI include parallel imaging and compressed sensing. Two types
of parallel imaging include linear predictability, which assumes that the
Fourier samples are linearly related, and sensitivity encoding, which
incorporates a priori knowledge of the sensitivity maps. In this work, we
combine compressed sensing with both types of parallel imaging using a novel
regularization term: SPIRiT regularization. When combined, the reconstructed
images are improved. We demonstrate results on data of a brain, a knee, and an
ankle.

Conclusion: 该方法成功利用2D X射线投影先验解决了零样本3D CT超分辨率问题，为临床诊断提供了高质量的重建效果。

Abstract: Computed tomography (CT) is widely used in clinical diagnosis, but acquiring
high-resolution (HR) CT is limited by radiation exposure risks. Deep
learning-based super-resolution (SR) methods have been studied to reconstruct
HR from low-resolution (LR) inputs. While supervised SR approaches have shown
promising results, they require large-scale paired LR-HR volume datasets that
are often unavailable. In contrast, zero-shot methods alleviate the need for
paired data by using only a single LR input, but typically struggle to recover
fine anatomical details due to limited internal information. To overcome these,
we propose a novel zero-shot 3D CT SR framework that leverages upsampled 2D
X-ray projection priors generated by a diffusion model. Exploiting the
abundance of HR 2D X-ray data, we train a diffusion model on large-scale 2D
X-ray projection and introduce a per-projection adaptive sampling strategy. It
selects the generative process for each projection, thus providing HR
projections as strong external priors for 3D CT reconstruction. These
projections serve as inputs to 3D Gaussian splatting for reconstructing a 3D CT
volume. Furthermore, we propose negative alpha blending (NAB-GS) that allows
negative values in Gaussian density representation. NAB-GS enables residual
learning between LR and diffusion-based projections, thereby enhancing
high-frequency structure reconstruction. Experiments on two datasets show that
our method achieves superior quantitative and qualitative results for 3D CT SR.

Conclusion: 提出的AnoPILaD方法展示了视觉语言模型与扩散模型结合在数字病理学无监督异常检测中的有效性，为跨器官病理异常检测提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Anomaly detection is an emerging approach in digital pathology for its
ability to efficiently and effectively utilize data for disease diagnosis.
While supervised learning approaches deliver high accuracy, they rely on
extensively annotated datasets, suffering from data scarcity in digital
pathology. Unsupervised anomaly detection, however, offers a viable alternative
by identifying deviations from normal tissue distributions without requiring
exhaustive annotations. Recently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models have
gained popularity in unsupervised anomaly detection, achieving promising
performance in both natural and medical imaging datasets. Building on this, we
incorporate a vision-language model with a diffusion model for unsupervised
anomaly detection in digital pathology, utilizing histopathology prompts during
reconstruction. Our approach employs a set of pathology-related keywords
associated with normal tissues to guide the reconstruction process,
facilitating the differentiation between normal and abnormal tissues. To
evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct experiments on a
gastric lymph node dataset from a local hospital and assess its generalization
ability under domain shift using a public breast lymph node dataset. The
experimental results highlight the potential of the proposed method for
unsupervised anomaly detection across various organs in digital pathology.

approach leverages hybrid supervision, combining ground-truth labels with
teacher models' soft targets to balance accuracy and computational efficiency.
We validate our models on two benchmark datasets: COVID-QU-Ex and LCS25000,
covering multiple classes, including COVID-19, healthy, non-COVID pneumonia,
lung, and colon cancer. To interpret the spatial focus of the models, we employ
Score-CAM-based visualizations, which provide insight into the reasoning
process of both teacher and student networks. The results demonstrate that the
distilled student model maintains high classification performance with
significantly reduced parameters and inference time, making it an optimal
choice in resource-constrained clinical environments. Our work underscores the
importance of combining model efficiency with explainability for practical,
trustworthy medical AI solutions.

Abstract: Numerous deep learning-based solutions have been developed for the automatic
recognition of breast cancer using mammography images. However, their
performance often declines when applied to data from different domains,
primarily due to domain shift -- the variation in data distributions between
source and target domains. This performance drop limits the safe and equitable
deployment of AI in real-world clinical settings. In this study, we present
DoSReMC (Domain Shift Resilient Mammography Classification), a batch
normalization (BN) adaptation framework designed to enhance cross-domain
generalization without retraining the entire model. Using three large-scale
full-field digital mammography (FFDM) datasets -- including HCTP, a newly
introduced, pathologically confirmed in-house dataset -- we conduct a
systematic cross-domain evaluation with convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
Our results demonstrate that BN layers are a primary source of domain
dependence: they perform effectively when training and testing occur within the
same domain, and they significantly impair model generalization under domain
shift. DoSReMC addresses this limitation by fine-tuning only the BN and fully
connected (FC) layers, while preserving pretrained convolutional filters. We
further integrate this targeted adaptation with an adversarial training scheme,
yielding additional improvements in cross-domain generalizability. DoSReMC can
be readily incorporated into existing AI pipelines and applied across diverse
clinical environments, providing a practical pathway toward more robust and
generalizable mammography classification systems.

Conclusion: 基于深度均衡模型的DECSC框架有效统一了局部空谱相关性、非局部空间自相似性和全局空间一致性，为高光谱图像去噪提供了强大解决方案

Abstract: Hyperspectral images (HSIs) play a crucial role in remote sensing but are
often degraded by complex noise patterns. Ensuring the physical property of the
denoised HSIs is vital for robust HSI denoising, giving the rise of deep
unfolding-based methods. However, these methods map the optimization of a
physical model to a learnable network with a predefined depth, which lacks
convergence guarantees. In contrast, Deep Equilibrium (DEQ) models treat the
hidden layers of deep networks as the solution to a fixed-point problem and
models them as infinite-depth networks, naturally consistent with the
optimization. Under the framework of DEQ, we propose a Deep Equilibrium
Convolutional Sparse Coding (DECSC) framework that unifies local
spatial-spectral correlations, nonlocal spatial self-similarities, and global
spatial consistency for robust HSI denoising. Within the convolutional sparse
coding (CSC) framework, we enforce shared 2D convolutional sparse
representation to ensure global spatial consistency across bands, while
unshared 3D convolutional sparse representation captures local spatial-spectral
details. To further exploit nonlocal self-similarities, a transformer block is
embedded after the 2D CSC. Additionally, a detail enhancement module is
integrated with the 3D CSC to promote image detail preservation. We formulate
the proximal gradient descent of the CSC model as a fixed-point problem and
transform the iterative updates into a learnable network architecture within
the framework of DEQ. Experimental results demonstrate that our DECSC method
achieves superior denoising performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了使用机器学习模型从低能量图像生成虚拟双能量扣除图像的方法，以减少挽也受到的放射。最佳模型达到了85.59%的F1分数，还有提升空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过从低能量图像生成虚拟双能量扣除图像，可以减少患者在高能量图像采集过程中接触的放射浮量，同时保持诊断效果。

Method: 研究了三种图像转换模型：预训练U-Net模型、端到端训练U-Net模型和CycleGAN模型，并评估这些虚拟DES图像对恶性与非恶性分类的影响。

Result: 预训练U-Net模型表现最佳，使用虚拟DES图像获得85.59%的F1分数，这与使用真实DES图像的90.35%相比还有一定差距，但展现了良好的潜力。

Conclusion: 虚拟DES图像生成具有重要的临床应用价值，未来技术进步有望缩小与真实图像的性能差距，实现临床上可独立依赖虚拟图像的可能性。

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM) is an imaging modality that
provides two types of images, commonly known as low-energy (LE) and dual-energy
subtracted (DES) images. In many domains, particularly in medicine, the
emergence of image-to-image translation techniques has enabled the artificial
generation of images using other images as input. Within CESM, applying such
techniques to generate DES images from LE images could be highly beneficial,
potentially reducing patient exposure to radiation associated with high-energy
image acquisition. In this study, we investigated three models for the
artificial generation of DES images (virtual DES): a pre-trained U-Net model, a
U-Net trained end-to-end model, and a CycleGAN model. We also performed a
series of experiments to assess the impact of using virtual DES images on the
classification of CESM examinations into malignant and non-malignant
categories. To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the impact of
virtual DES images on CESM lesion classification. The results demonstrate that
the best performance was achieved with the pre-trained U-Net model, yielding an
F1 score of 85.59% when using the virtual DES images, compared to 90.35% with
the real DES images. This discrepancy likely results from the additional
diagnostic information in real DES images, which contributes to a higher
classification accuracy. Nevertheless, the potential for virtual DES image
generation is considerable and future advancements may narrow this performance
gap to a level where exclusive reliance on virtual DES images becomes
clinically viable.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新题的医学影像标注方法，通过收集射彩科医师的像素级信心度值来模型标签不确定性，并在训练AI模型时利用这些信心度信息提升了分割性能和下游临床任务的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像中观察者间的标注变异性导致标签不确定性，特别是在胸部超声这种视觉解释主观性强的模态中。传统的绝对真实标签方法无法抓取这种内在的不确定性，影响AI模型的可靠性和临床应用价值。

Method: 设计了一种数据标注协议，收集射彩科医师对每个标注区域的像素级信心度值。在训练时使用不同信心度阈值（如60%）对标签进行二值化处理，对比了多种将不确定性暴露给学习模型的方法。

Result: 经验证，使用高信心度阈值（60%）训练的模型在分割性能上显著提升，这种改善转化为下游临床任务的更佳表现，包括S/F氧合比值估计、S/F比值变化分类和30天病人再入院预测。高阈值方法远超过传统的50%阈值方法。

Conclusion: 标签信心度是一个有价值的信号，通过合理利用可以显著提升AI在医学影像中的可靠性和临床应用价值。在高信心度标签上训练模型比使用所有标签更有效。

Abstract: In medical imaging, inter-observer variability among radiologists often
introduces label uncertainty, particularly in modalities where visual
interpretation is subjective. Lung ultrasound (LUS) is a prime example-it
frequently presents a mixture of highly ambiguous regions and clearly
discernible structures, making consistent annotation challenging even for
experienced clinicians. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to both
labeling and training AI models using expert-supplied, per-pixel confidence
values. Rather than treating annotations as absolute ground truth, we design a
data annotation protocol that captures the confidence that radiologists have in
each labeled region, modeling the inherent aleatoric uncertainty present in
real-world clinical data. We demonstrate that incorporating these confidence
values during training leads to improved segmentation performance. More
importantly, we show that this enhanced segmentation quality translates into
better performance on downstream clinically-critical tasks-specifically,
estimating S/F oxygenation ratio values, classifying S/F ratio change, and
predicting 30-day patient readmission. While we empirically evaluate many
methods for exposing the uncertainty to the learning model, we find that a
simple approach that trains a model on binarized labels obtained with a (60%)
confidence threshold works well. Importantly, high thresholds work far better
than a naive approach of a 50% threshold, indicating that training on very
confident pixels is far more effective. Our study systematically investigates
the impact of training with varying confidence thresholds, comparing not only
segmentation metrics but also downstream clinical outcomes. These results
suggest that label confidence is a valuable signal that, when properly
leveraged, can significantly enhance the reliability and clinical utility of AI
in medical imaging.

Motivation: 脑MRA血管分割对手术至关重要，但现有方法精度不足且缺乏公开标注数据集

Method: 基于Hessian矩阵的半监督学习轻量神经网络HessNet，仅6000参数，可在CPU运行

Result: 在最小训练集上达到SOTA血管分割精度，创建了包含200张IXI数据集图像的半手动标注脑血管数据集

Conclusion: HessNet提供高效的血管分割解决方案，显著降低资源需求，有助于专家专注于复杂病例，数据集已公开

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of blood vessels in brain magnetic resonance
angiography (MRA) is essential for successful surgical procedures, such as
aneurysm repair or bypass surgery. Currently, annotation is primarily performed
through manual segmentation or classical methods, such as the Frangi filter,
which often lack sufficient accuracy. Neural networks have emerged as powerful
tools for medical image segmentation, but their development depends on
well-annotated training datasets. However, there is a notable lack of publicly
available MRA datasets with detailed brain vessel annotations.
  To address this gap, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning lightweight
neural network with Hessian matrices on board for 3D segmentation of complex
structures such as tubular structures, which we named HessNet. The solution is
a Hessian-based neural network with only 6000 parameters. HessNet can run on
the CPU and significantly reduces the resource requirements for training neural
networks. The accuracy of vessel segmentation on a minimal training dataset
reaches state-of-the-art results. It helps us create a large, semi-manually
annotated brain vessel dataset of brain MRA images based on the IXI dataset
(annotated 200 images). Annotation was performed by three experts under the
supervision of three neurovascular surgeons after applying HessNet. It provides
high accuracy of vessel segmentation and allows experts to focus only on the
most complex important cases. The dataset is available at

Method: 结合图像分割、各向异性扩散的光照传播算法，基于基础场景理解进行重照明

Result: 能在边缘设备上达到100fps的高速率，精确修正扫描错误，产生视觉吸引力强的重照明效果

Conclusion: 该方法结合了深度学习和简单筛波器方法的优点，为混合现实应用提供了高性能、高质量的重照明解决方案

Abstract: Mixed Reality scene relighting, where virtual changes to lighting conditions
realistically interact with physical objects, producing authentic illumination
and shadows, can be used in a variety of applications. One such application in
real estate could be visualizing a room at different times of day and placing
virtual light fixtures. Existing deep learning-based relighting techniques
typically exceed the real-time performance capabilities of current MR devices.
On the other hand, scene understanding methods, such as on-device scene
reconstruction, often yield inaccurate results due to scanning limitations, in
turn affecting relighting quality. Finally, simpler 2D image filter-based
approaches cannot represent complex geometry and shadows. We introduce a novel
method to integrate image segmentation, with lighting propagation via
anisotropic diffusion on top of basic scene understanding, and the
computational simplicity of filter-based techniques. Our approach corrects
on-device scanning inaccuracies, delivering visually appealing and accurate
relighting effects in real-time on edge devices, achieving speeds as high as
100 fps. We show a direct comparison between our method and the industry
standard, and present a practical demonstration of our method in the
aforementioned real estate example.

TL;DR: DeCoDi是一种针对文本到图像扩散模型的去偏方法，通过改变推理过程来避免潜在维度中的偏见概念区域，无需复杂干预或显著计算开销


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度学习去偏方法通常需要复杂或计算密集的干预，而DeCoDi旨在仅改变推理过程，使其对更广泛的从业者更加可访问

Method: 改变扩散过程以避免潜在维度中偏见概念的区域，该方法仅修改推理过程而不需要重新训练模型

Result: 在护士、消防员和CEO等概念上成功去除了性别、种族和年龄偏见，人工评估1200张图像显示方法有效，GPT4o自动评估与人工评估结果统计上无显著差异

Conclusion: DeCoDi方法有潜力显著改善基于扩散的文本到图像生成模型生成图像的多样性，评估结果显示评估者间一致性良好，对受保护属性的覆盖更全面

Abstract: We propose DeCoDi, a debiasing procedure for text-to-image diffusion-based
models that changes the inference procedure, does not significantly change
image quality, has negligible compute overhead, and can be applied in any
diffusion-based image generation model. DeCoDi changes the diffusion process to
avoid latent dimension regions of biased concepts. While most deep learning
debiasing methods require complex or compute-intensive interventions, our
method is designed to change only the inference procedure. Therefore, it is
more accessible to a wide range of practitioners. We show the effectiveness of
the method by debiasing for gender, ethnicity, and age for the concepts of
nurse, firefighter, and CEO. Two distinct human evaluators manually inspect
1,200 generated images. Their evaluation results provide evidence that our
method is effective in mitigating biases based on gender, ethnicity, and age.
We also show that an automatic bias evaluation performed by the GPT4o is not
significantly statistically distinct from a human evaluation. Our evaluation
shows promising results, with reliable levels of agreement between evaluators
and more coverage of protected attributes. Our method has the potential to
significantly improve the diversity of images it generates by diffusion-based
text-to-image generative models.

Method: 使用基于智能体的LLM系统，结合角色个性、欲望和关系生成智能体间对话，并利用对话内容、个性、情感状态、视觉和物理状态来控制每个智能体的导航和转向

Result: 在复杂场景中验证了方法有效性，观察到智能体自动分组和解组现象，方法可作为人群内部信息传递机制，产生更真实的人群模拟和自然涌现的群体行为

Conclusion: 该方法通过整合语言模型和对话系统，显著提升了人群模拟的真实性，能够自然产生基于环境设置的社会群体行为

Abstract: Animating and simulating crowds using an agent-based approach is a
well-established area where every agent in the crowd is individually controlled
such that global human-like behaviour emerges. We observe that human navigation
and movement in crowds are often influenced by complex social and environmental
interactions, driven mainly by language and dialogue. However, most existing
work does not consider these dimensions and leads to animations where
agent-agent and agent-environment interactions are largely limited to steering
and fixed higher-level goal extrapolation.
  We propose a novel method that exploits large language models (LLMs) to
control agents' movement. Our method has two main components: a dialogue system
and language-driven navigation. We periodically query agent-centric LLMs
conditioned on character personalities, roles, desires, and relationships to
control the generation of inter-agent dialogue when necessitated by the spatial
and social relationships with neighbouring agents. We then use the conversation
and each agent's personality, emotional state, vision, and physical state to
control the navigation and steering of each agent. Our model thus enables
agents to make motion decisions based on both their perceptual inputs and the
ongoing dialogue.
  We validate our method in two complex scenarios that exemplify the interplay
between social interactions, steering, and crowding. In these scenarios, we
observe that grouping and ungrouping of agents automatically occur.
Additionally, our experiments show that our method serves as an
information-passing mechanism within the crowd. As a result, our framework
produces more realistic crowd simulations, with emergent group behaviours
arising naturally from any environmental setting.

Conclusion: 该研究为个性化伤口护理、及时干预和改善患者预后奠定了基础，解决了手术伤口筛查中的数据隐私和标注成本问题。

Abstract: Surgical site infection (SSI) is one of the most common and costly
healthcare-associated infections and and surgical wound care remains a
significant clinical challenge in preventing SSIs and improving patient
outcomes. While recent studies have explored the use of deep learning for
preliminary surgical wound screening, progress has been hindered by concerns
over data privacy and the high costs associated with expert annotation.
Currently, no publicly available dataset or benchmark encompasses various types
of surgical wounds, resulting in the absence of an open-source Surgical-Wound
screening tool. To address this gap: (1) we present SurgWound, the first
open-source dataset featuring a diverse array of surgical wound types. It
contains 697 surgical wound images annotated by 3 professional surgeons with
eight fine-grained clinical attributes. (2) Based on SurgWound, we introduce
the first benchmark for surgical wound diagnosis, which includes visual
question answering (VQA) and report generation tasks to comprehensively
evaluate model performance. (3) Furthermore, we propose a three-stage learning
framework, WoundQwen, for surgical wound diagnosis. In the first stage, we
employ five independent MLLMs to accurately predict specific surgical wound
characteristics. In the second stage, these predictions serve as additional
knowledge inputs to two MLLMs responsible for diagnosing outcomes, which assess
infection risk and guide subsequent interventions. In the third stage, we train
a MLLM that integrates the diagnostic results from the previous two stages to
produce a comprehensive report. This three-stage framework can analyze detailed
surgical wound characteristics and provide subsequent instructions to patients
based on surgical images, paving the way for personalized wound care, timely
intervention, and improved patient outcomes.

Motivation: 扩散模型在照片真实感方面表现出色，但在空间精度、对齐和符号结构方面难以满足流程图等精确图表的需求，需要开发能够保持空间精度和符号结构的草图到图表生成方法。

Method: 训练自由的代理系统，结合视觉语言模型(VLM)和大型语言模型(LLMs)，通过迭代循环：批评VLM提出定性关系编辑，多个候选LLM以不同策略合成SVG更新，法官VLM选择最佳候选，确保稳定改进。

Result: 在10个来自已发表论文流程图的草图测试中，该方法比GPT-5和Gemini-2.5-Pro更忠实地重建布局和结构，准确组合图元而不插入不需要的文本。

Abstract: We study sketch-to-diagram generation: converting rough hand sketches into
precise, compositional diagrams. Diffusion models excel at photorealism but
struggle with the spatial precision, alignment, and symbolic structure required
for flowcharts. We introduce See it. Say it. Sorted., a training-free agentic
system that couples a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with Large Language Models
(LLMs) to produce editable Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) programs. The system
runs an iterative loop in which a Critic VLM proposes a small set of
qualitative, relational edits; multiple candidate LLMs synthesize SVG updates
with diverse strategies (conservative->aggressive, alternative, focused); and a
Judge VLM selects the best candidate, ensuring stable improvement. This design
prioritizes qualitative reasoning over brittle numerical estimates, preserves
global constraints (e.g., alignment, connectivity), and naturally supports
human-in-the-loop corrections. On 10 sketches derived from flowcharts in
published papers, our method more faithfully reconstructs layout and structure
than two frontier closed-source image generation LLMs (GPT-5 and
Gemini-2.5-Pro), accurately composing primitives (e.g., multi-headed arrows)
without inserting unwanted text. Because outputs are programmatic SVGs, the
approach is readily extensible to presentation tools (e.g., PowerPoint) via
APIs and can be specialized with improved prompts and task-specific tools. The
codebase is open-sourced at

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis with medical large language models is hindered by
knowledge gaps and hallucinations. Retrieval and tool-augmented methods help,
but their impact is limited by weak use of external knowledge and poor
feedback-reasoning traceability. To address these challenges, We introduce
Deep-DxSearch, an agentic RAG system trained end-to-end with reinforcement
learning (RL) that enables steer tracebale retrieval-augmented reasoning for
medical diagnosis. In Deep-DxSearch, we first construct a large-scale medical
retrieval corpus comprising patient records and reliable medical knowledge
sources to support retrieval-aware reasoning across diagnostic scenarios. More
crutially, we frame the LLM as the core agent and the retrieval corpus as its
environment, using tailored rewards on format, retrieval, reasoning structure,
and diagnostic accuracy, thereby evolving the agentic RAG policy from
large-scale data through RL.
  Experiments demonstrate that our end-to-end agentic RL training framework
consistently outperforms prompt-engineering and training-free RAG approaches
across multiple data centers. After training, Deep-DxSearch achieves
substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing strong diagnostic
baselines such as GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and other medical-specific frameworks
for both common and rare disease diagnosis under in-distribution and
out-of-distribution settings. Moreover, ablation studies on reward design and
retrieval corpus components confirm their critical roles, underscoring the
uniqueness and effectiveness of our approach compared with traditional
implementations. Finally, case studies and interpretability analyses highlight
improvements in Deep-DxSearch's diagnostic policy, providing deeper insight
into its performance gains and supporting clinicians in delivering more
reliable and precise preliminary diagnoses. See

Motivation: 随着文本到图像生成模型在隐私、版权和安全方面的担忧日益增加，概念擦除技术被开发出来阻止生成特定不良概念。然而这些技术的实际效果和鲁棒性需要系统评估。

Method: 提出了Side Effect Evaluation (SEE)评估基准，包含层次化和组合式提示，通过自动化评估管道从三个维度量化CETs的副作用：对邻近概念的影响、目标规避和属性泄漏。

Conclusion: 当前的概念擦除技术存在严重缺陷，需要更鲁棒的解决方案。作者发布了数据集、代码和评估工具以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Concerns about text-to-image (T2I) generative models infringing on privacy,
copyright, and safety have led to the development of Concept Erasure Techniques
(CETs).
  The goal of an effective CET is to prohibit the generation of undesired
``target'' concepts specified by the user, while preserving the ability to
synthesize high-quality images of the remaining concepts.
  In this work, we demonstrate that CETs can be easily circumvented and present
several side effects of concept erasure.
  For a comprehensive measurement of the robustness of CETs, we present Side
Effect Evaluation (\see), an evaluation benchmark that consists of hierarchical
and compositional prompts that describe objects and their attributes.
  This dataset and our automated evaluation pipeline quantify side effects of
CETs across three aspects: impact on neighboring concepts, evasion of targets,
and attribute leakage.
  Our experiments reveal that CETs can be circumvented by using
superclass-subclass hierarchy and semantically similar prompts, such as
compositional variants of the target. We show that CETs suffer from attribute
leakage and counterintuitive phenomena of attention concentration or dispersal.
  We release our dataset, code, and evaluation tools to aid future work on
robust concept erasure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管似然在理论上是最优的OOD检测器，但在实践中经常失败。研究旨在确定这是否是由于像素空间的问题，还是表示空间也存在密度估计的困难。

Method: 训练变分扩散模型在预训练ResNet-18的表示空间上，而不是在图像像素空间上，使用OpenOOD套件中的最先进方法进行比较评估。

Result: 表示空间中的似然检测器性能优于像素空间，表明像素空间可能是导致似然检测器在实践中失败的主要原因。

Conclusion: 表示空间中的似然检测器能够更好地进行OOD检测，解决了像素空间中似然检测器失败的问题，为OOD检测提供了更有效的方法。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in AI, safety remains the main bottleneck to deploying
machine-learning systems. A critical safety component is out-of-distribution
detection: given an input, decide whether it comes from the same distribution
as the training data. In generative models, the most natural OOD score is the
data likelihood. Actually, under the assumption of uniformly distributed OOD
data, the likelihood is even the optimal OOD detector, as we show in this work.
However, earlier work reported that likelihood often fails in practice, raising
doubts about its usefulness. We explore whether, in practice, the
representation space also suffers from the inability to learn good density
estimation for OOD detection, or if it is merely a problem of the pixel space
typically used in generative models. To test this, we trained a Variational
Diffusion Model not on images, but on the representation space of a pre-trained
ResNet-18 to assess the performance of our likelihood-based detector in
comparison to state-of-the-art methods from the OpenOOD suite.

Abstract: In recent years, a plethora of open-source foundation models have emerged,
achieving remarkable progress in some widely attended fields, with performance
being quite close to that of closed-source models. However, in high-value but
more challenging scientific professional fields, either the fields still rely
on expert models, or the progress of general foundation models lags
significantly compared to those in popular areas, far from sufficient for
transforming scientific research and leaving substantial gap between
open-source models and closed-source models in these scientific domains. To
mitigate this gap and explore a step further toward Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI), we introduce Intern-S1, a specialized generalist equipped
with general understanding and reasoning capabilities with expertise to analyze
multiple science modal data. Intern-S1 is a multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
model with 28 billion activated parameters and 241 billion total parameters,
continually pre-trained on 5T tokens, including over 2.5T tokens from
scientific domains. In the post-training stage, Intern-S1 undergoes offline and
then online reinforcement learning (RL) in InternBootCamp, where we propose
Mixture-of-Rewards (MoR) to synergize the RL training on more than 1000 tasks
simultaneously. Through integrated innovations in algorithms, data, and
training systems, Intern-S1 achieved top-tier performance in online RL
training.On comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, Intern-S1 demonstrates
competitive performance on general reasoning tasks among open-source models and
significantly outperforms open-source models in scientific domains, surpassing
closed-source state-of-the-art models in professional tasks, such as molecular
synthesis planning, reaction condition prediction, predicting thermodynamic
stabilities for crystals. Our models are available at

*Nan-Hong Kuo,Hojjat Baghban*

TL;DR: Holo-Artisan是一个创新的虚拟博物馆系统，通过全息显示和边缘智能实现沉浸式多用户体验，让数字艺术品实时个性化响应每位观众。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统博物馆展览是静态的，缺乏与观众的互动性。作者希望创造一种动态的、个性化的文化体验，让艺术品能够与每位观众进行实时对话和互动。

Method: 系统采用边缘计算节点处理实时用户数据（姿态、表情、语音），生成式AI驱动数字艺术品响应。云端协作平台使用通用场景描述和光线追踪渲染高保真视图，并通过联邦学习保护隐私并持续优化个性化体验。

Result: 系统能够实现多用户同时体验，例如蒙娜丽莎可以同时对一位观众微笑，同时与另一位观众进行语音问答，所有交互都是实时进行的。

Conclusion: Holo-Artisan将静态博物馆展品转变为动态的、活生生的艺术品，开创了文化遗产互动的新范式，通过边缘计算和联邦学习确保了低延迟和隐私保护。

Abstract: We present Holo-Artisan, a novel system architecture enabling immersive
multi-user experiences in virtual museums through true holographic displays and
personalized edge intelligence. In our design, local edge computing nodes
process real-time user data -- including pose, facial expression, and voice --
for multiple visitors concurrently. Generative AI models then drive digital
artworks (e.g., a volumetric Mona Lisa) to respond uniquely to each viewer. For
instance, the Mona Lisa can return a smile to one visitor while engaging in a
spoken Q\&A with another, all in real time. A cloud-assisted collaboration
platform composes these interactions in a shared scene using a universal scene
description, and employs ray tracing to render high-fidelity, personalized
views with a direct pipeline to glasses-free holographic displays. To preserve
user privacy and continuously improve personalization, we integrate federated
learning (FL) -- edge devices locally fine-tune AI models and share only model
updates for aggregation. This edge-centric approach minimizes latency and
bandwidth usage, ensuring a synchronized shared experience with individual
customization. Through Holo-Artisan, static museum exhibits are transformed
into dynamic, living artworks that engage each visitor in a personal dialogue,
heralding a new paradigm of cultural heritage interaction.

Abstract: Recent years have brought about a surge in neuromorphic ``event'' video
research, primarily targeting computer vision applications. Event video eschews
video frames in favor of asynchronous, per-pixel intensity samples. While much
work has focused on a handful of representations for specific event cameras,
these representations have shown limitations in flexibility, speed, and
compressibility. We previously proposed the unified AD{\Delta}ER representation
to address these concerns. This paper introduces numerous improvements to the
\textit{adder-viz} software for visualizing real-time event transcode processes
and applications in-the-loop. The MIT-licensed software is available from a

TL;DR: 基于物理信息生成对抗网络的自学习方法，从单张X光相位对比成像恢复样品平面的相位和吸收信息，无需训练数据且适用于多样化实验条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的相位恢复方法需要特定偏微或边界条件，且需专家手动调整参数，在复杂或变化条件下适用性有限。获取合适的训练数据也是主要挑战。

Method: 使用物理信息生成对抗网络(GAN)，从单张近场激光器图像中自学习恢复样品平面的相位和吸收信息，无需任何训练数据。

Conclusion: 该自学习方法为X光相位对比成像提供了一种灵活、无需训练数据的恢复方案，显著扩大了该技术在多样化实验条件下的应用范围。

Abstract: X-ray phase contrast imaging significantly improves the visualization of
structures with weak or uniform absorption, broadening its applications across
a wide range of scientific disciplines. Propagation-based phase contrast is
particularly suitable for time- or dose-critical in vivo/in situ/operando
(tomography) experiments because it requires only a single intensity
measurement. However, the phase information of the wave field is lost during
the measurement and must be recovered. Conventional algebraic and iterative
methods often rely on specific approximations or boundary conditions that may
not be met by many samples or experimental setups. In addition, they require
manual tuning of reconstruction parameters by experts, making them less
adaptable for complex or variable conditions. Here we present a self-learning
approach for solving the inverse problem of phase retrieval in the near-field
regime of Fresnel theory using a single intensity measurement (hologram). A
physics-informed generative adversarial network is employed to reconstruct both
the phase and absorbance of the unpropagated wave field in the sample plane
from a single hologram. Unlike most deep learning approaches for phase
retrieval, our approach does not require paired, unpaired, or simulated
training data. This significantly broadens the applicability of our approach,
as acquiring or generating suitable training data remains a major challenge due
to the wide variability in sample types and experimental configurations. The
algorithm demonstrates robust and consistent performance across diverse imaging
conditions and sample types, delivering quantitative, high-quality
reconstructions for both simulated data and experimental datasets acquired at
beamline P05 at PETRA III (DESY, Hamburg), operated by Helmholtz-Zentrum
Hereon. Furthermore, it enables the simultaneous retrieval of both phase and
absorption information.

Method: 纳入>5年随访的PACG患者，AI分割OCT获取31个ONH参数，结合分区视野敏感度，使用多种机器学习模型训练分类器，SHAP分析关键预测因子

Result: 分析451眼，随机森林模型结合结构和功能特征表现最佳(AUC=0.87)，识别出6个关键预测因子，单纯结构或功能模型表现较差

Conclusion: 结合ONH结构和VF功能参数显著改善PACG进展风险分类，下方ONH特征最为重要，强调ONH形态学在疾病监测中的关键作用

Abstract: Purpose: To classify eyes as slow or fast glaucoma progressors in patients
with primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) using an integrated approach
combining optic nerve head (ONH) structural features and sector-based visual
field (VF) functional parameters. Methods: PACG patients with >5 reliable VF
tests over >5 years were included. Progression was assessed in Zeiss Forum,
with baseline VF within six months of OCT. Fast progression was VFI decline
<-2.0% per year; slow progression >-2.0% per year. OCT volumes were
AI-segmented to extract 31 ONH parameters. The Glaucoma Hemifield Test defined
five regions per hemifield, aligned with RNFL distribution. Mean sensitivity
per region was combined with structural parameters to train ML classifiers.
Multiple models were tested, and SHAP identified key predictors. Main outcome
measures: Classification of slow versus fast progressors using combined
structural and functional data. Results: We analyzed 451 eyes from 299
patients. Mean VFI progression was -0.92% per year; 369 eyes progressed slowly
and 82 rapidly. The Random Forest model combining structural and functional
features achieved the best performance (AUC = 0.87, 2000 Monte Carlo
iterations). SHAP identified six key predictors: inferior MRW, inferior and
inferior-temporal RNFL thickness, nasal-temporal LC curvature, superior nasal
VF sensitivity, and inferior RNFL and GCL+IPL thickness. Models using only
structural or functional features performed worse with AUC of 0.82 and 0.78,
respectively. Conclusions: Combining ONH structural and VF functional
parameters significantly improves classification of progression risk in PACG.
Inferior ONH features, MRW and RNFL thickness, were the most predictive,
highlighting the critical role of ONH morphology in monitoring disease
progression.

Conclusion: NeRD为解决机器人动力学仿真问题提供了一种通用且可泛化的神经模拟器方案，相比传统模拟器具有更好的适应性和从真实数据学习的能力。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient simulation of modern robots remains challenging due to
their high degrees of freedom and intricate mechanisms. Neural simulators have
emerged as a promising alternative to traditional analytical simulators,
capable of efficiently predicting complex dynamics and adapting to real-world
data; however, existing neural simulators typically require
application-specific training and fail to generalize to novel tasks and/or
environments, primarily due to inadequate representations of the global state.
In this work, we address the problem of learning generalizable neural
simulators for robots that are structured as articulated rigid bodies. We
propose NeRD (Neural Robot Dynamics), learned robot-specific dynamics models
for predicting future states for articulated rigid bodies under contact
constraints. NeRD uniquely replaces the low-level dynamics and contact solvers
in an analytical simulator and employs a robot-centric and spatially-invariant
simulation state representation. We integrate the learned NeRD models as an
interchangeable backend solver within a state-of-the-art robotics simulator. We
conduct extensive experiments to show that the NeRD simulators are stable and
accurate over a thousand simulation steps; generalize across tasks and
environment configurations; enable policy learning exclusively in a neural
engine; and, unlike most classical simulators, can be fine-tuned from
real-world data to bridge the gap between simulation and reality.

Abstract: In hazardous and remote environments, robotic systems perform critical tasks
demanding improved safety and efficiency. Among these, quadruped robots with
manipulator arms offer mobility and versatility for complex operations.
However, teleoperating quadruped robots is challenging due to the lack of
integrated obstacle detection and intuitive control methods for the robotic
arm, increasing collision risks in confined or dynamically changing workspaces.
Teleoperation via joysticks or pads can be non-intuitive and demands a high
level of expertise due to its complexity, culminating in a high cognitive load
on the operator. To address this challenge, a teleoperation approach that
directly maps human arm movements to the robotic manipulator offers a simpler
and more accessible solution. This work proposes an intuitive remote control by
leveraging a vision-based pose estimation pipeline that utilizes an external
camera with a machine learning-based model to detect the operator's wrist
position. The system maps these wrist movements into robotic arm commands to
control the robot's arm in real-time. A trajectory planner ensures safe
teleoperation by detecting and preventing collisions with both obstacles and
the robotic arm itself. The system was validated on the real robot,
demonstrating robust performance in real-time control. This teleoperation
approach provides a cost-effective solution for industrial applications where
safety, precision, and ease of use are paramount, ensuring reliable and
intuitive robotic control in high-risk environments.

Abstract: The logistics and construction industries face persistent challenges in
automating pallet handling, especially in outdoor environments with variable
payloads, inconsistencies in pallet quality and dimensions, and unstructured
surroundings. In this paper, we tackle automation of a critical step in pallet
transport: the pallet pick-up operation. Our work is motivated by labor
shortages, safety concerns, and inefficiencies in manually locating and
retrieving pallets under such conditions. We present Lang2Lift, a framework
that leverages foundation models for natural language-guided pallet detection
and 6D pose estimation, enabling operators to specify targets through intuitive
commands such as "pick up the steel beam pallet near the crane." The perception
pipeline integrates Florence-2 and SAM-2 for language-grounded segmentation
with FoundationPose for robust pose estimation in cluttered, multi-pallet
outdoor scenes under variable lighting. The resulting poses feed into a motion
planning module for fully autonomous forklift operation. We validate Lang2Lift
on the ADAPT autonomous forklift platform, achieving 0.76 mIoU pallet
segmentation accuracy on a real-world test dataset. Timing and error analysis
demonstrate the system's robustness and confirm its feasibility for deployment
in operational logistics and construction environments. Video demonstrations

Conclusion: 多体记忆的物理学比以前认识的更为丰富多彩，物理系统可以通过多种不同机制实现稳健的信息存储，为非平衡动力学中的信息处理提供了新的视角

Abstract: We investigate the landscape of many-body memories: families of local
non-equilibrium dynamics that retain information about their initial conditions
for thermodynamically long time scales, even in the presence of arbitrary
perturbations. In two dimensions, the only well-studied memory is Toom's rule.
Using a combination of rigorous proofs and machine learning methods, we show
that the landscape of 2D memories is in fact quite vast. We discover memories
that correct errors in ways qualitatively distinct from Toom's rule, have
ordered phases stabilized by fluctuations, and preserve information only in the
presence of noise. Taken together, our results show that physical systems can
perform robust information storage in many distinct ways, and demonstrate that
the physics of many-body memories is richer than previously realized.

Abstract: We present the first systematic investigation of graph reordering effects for
graph-based Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) on a GPU. While
graph-based ANNS has become the dominant paradigm for modern AI applications,
recent approaches focus on algorithmic innovations while neglecting memory
layout considerations that significantly affect execution time. Our unified
evaluation framework enables comprehensive evaluation of diverse reordering
strategies across different graph indices through a graph adapter that converts
arbitrary graph topologies into a common representation and a GPU-optimized
graph traversal engine. We conduct a comprehensive analysis across diverse
datasets and state-of-the-art graph indices, introducing analysis metrics that
quantify the relationship between structural properties and memory layout
effectiveness. Our GPU-targeted reordering achieves up to 15$\%$ QPS
improvements while preserving search accuracy, demonstrating that memory layout
optimization operates orthogonally to existing algorithmic innovations. We will
release all code upon publication to facilitate reproducibility and foster
further research.
