### [1] [YOLO11-CR: a Lightweight Convolution-and-Attention Framework for Accurate Fatigue Driving Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13205)
*Zhebin Jin,Ligang Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出YOLO11-CR轻量级目标检测模型，用于实时疲劳检测，通过CAFM和RCM模块提升特征表达和空间定位能力，在DSM数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有疲劳检测方法存在侵入性、硬件依赖或小目标检测困难等问题，需要开发非侵入式、鲁棒性强的实时检测方案。

Method: 提出YOLO11-CR模型，包含卷积与注意力融合模块(CAFM)整合CNN局部特征和Transformer全局上下文，以及矩形校准模块(RCM)捕获水平和垂直上下文信息。

Result: 在DSM数据集上达到精确率87.17%、召回率83.86%、mAP@50为88.09%、mAP@50-95为55.93%，显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: YOLO11-CR为车载疲劳监控提供了实用高效解决方案，具有实际部署潜力，未来可扩展时序建模、多模态数据融合和嵌入式优化。

Abstract: Driver fatigue detection is of paramount importance for intelligent
transportation systems due to its critical role in mitigating road traffic
accidents. While physiological and vehicle dynamics-based methods offer
accuracy, they are often intrusive, hardware-dependent, and lack robustness in
real-world environments. Vision-based techniques provide a non-intrusive and
scalable alternative, but still face challenges such as poor detection of small
or occluded objects and limited multi-scale feature modeling. To address these
issues, this paper proposes YOLO11-CR, a lightweight and efficient object
detection model tailored for real-time fatigue detection. YOLO11-CR introduces
two key modules: the Convolution-and-Attention Fusion Module (CAFM), which
integrates local CNN features with global Transformer-based context to enhance
feature expressiveness; and the Rectangular Calibration Module (RCM), which
captures horizontal and vertical contextual information to improve spatial
localization, particularly for profile faces and small objects like mobile
phones. Experiments on the DSM dataset demonstrated that YOLO11-CR achieves a
precision of 87.17%, recall of 83.86%, mAP@50 of 88.09%, and mAP@50-95 of
55.93%, outperforming baseline models significantly. Ablation studies further
validate the effectiveness of the CAFM and RCM modules in improving both
sensitivity and localization accuracy. These results demonstrate that YOLO11-CR
offers a practical and high-performing solution for in-vehicle fatigue
monitoring, with strong potential for real-world deployment and future
enhancements involving temporal modeling, multi-modal data integration, and
embedded optimization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Mirage基准和Mirage-R1模型，用于解决AI生成图像在真实场景中的检测问题，相比现有方法在基准测试中提升5-10%性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成图像在真实世界中传播对信息安全和公众信任构成威胁，现有检测器在实验室环境下有效但无法泛化到真实场景

Method: 构建Mirage基准数据集（包含网络收集和合成数据），提出Mirage-R1视觉语言模型，采用启发式到分析式推理机制，两阶段训练（监督微调+强化学习），推理时自适应思考策略

Result: 在Mirage基准和公共基准上分别领先最先进检测器5%和10%

Conclusion: Mirage基准和Mirage-R1模型有效解决了真实场景中AI生成图像检测的挑战，在性能和推理速度间取得了良好平衡

Abstract: The spreading of AI-generated images (AIGI), driven by advances in generative
AI, poses a significant threat to information security and public trust.
Existing AIGI detectors, while effective against images in clean laboratory
settings, fail to generalize to in-the-wild scenarios. These real-world images
are noisy, varying from ``obviously fake" images to realistic ones derived from
multiple generative models and further edited for quality control. We address
in-the-wild AIGI detection in this paper. We introduce Mirage, a challenging
benchmark designed to emulate the complexity of in-the-wild AIGI. Mirage is
constructed from two sources: (1) a large corpus of Internet-sourced AIGI
verified by human experts, and (2) a synthesized dataset created through the
collaboration between multiple expert generators, closely simulating the
realistic AIGI in the wild. Building on this benchmark, we propose Mirage-R1, a
vision-language model with heuristic-to-analytic reasoning, a reflective
reasoning mechanism for AIGI detection. Mirage-R1 is trained in two stages: a
supervised-fine-tuning cold start, followed by a reinforcement learning stage.
By further adopting an inference-time adaptive thinking strategy, Mirage-R1 is
able to provide either a quick judgment or a more robust and accurate
conclusion, effectively balancing inference speed and performance. Extensive
experiments show that our model leads state-of-the-art detectors by 5% and 10%
on Mirage and the public benchmark, respectively. The benchmark and code will
be made publicly available.

### [3] [DianJin-OCR-R1: Enhancing OCR Capabilities via a Reasoning-and-Tool Interleaved Vision-Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13238)
*Qian Chen,Xianyin Zhang,Lifan Guo,Feng Chen,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DianJin-OCR-R1是一个推理增强的视觉语言模型框架，通过结合自身OCR能力和专家模型工具来减少幻觉，在OCR任务中表现优于非推理模型和专家模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在文档图像解析中存在幻觉问题，且相比专门训练的专家模型在OCR任务上效果较差，需要一种方法来结合两者的优势。

Method: 提出推理增强框架，模型先自行识别图像内容，然后调用专家模型工具获取参考结果，最后重新审视图像和推理过程来提供最终识别结果。

Result: 在ReST和OmniDocBench数据集上的实验表明，DianJin-OCR-R1模型持续优于非推理对应模型和专家OCR模型。

Conclusion: 该方法通过推理和工具交织的方式有效缓解了LVLMs的幻觉问题，以较低成本提升了OCR性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have enabled a new
paradigm of end-to-end document image parsing, excelling in Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) tasks such as text, table, and formula recognition. However,
generative LVLMs, similarly to large language models (LLMs), are prone to
hallucinations--generating words that do not exist in input images.
Furthermore, LVLMs are designed for general purposes and tend to be less
effective on OCR tasks compared to expert models that are trained on
domain-specific datasets. In this paper, we propose DianJin-OCR-R1, a
reasoning-enhanced framework designed to address these limitations through
training reasoning-and-tool interleaved VLMs. Given a recognition instruction,
our DianJin-OCR-R1 model first recognizes the content in the input image by its
own OCR capabilities, and then calls other tools (i.e., other expert models) to
obtain their results as references, finally looks again the image and rethinks
about the reasoning process to provide the final recognized content. Since
architectures of expert models are tailored for specific OCR tasks, which makes
them less prone to hallucinations, their results can help VLMs mitigate
hallucinations. Additionally, expert models are typically smaller in scale and
easy to iterate, enabling performance improvements for VLMs at a lower cost. We
evaluate our model on ReST and OmniDocBench, and experimental results show that
our DianJin-OCR-R1 models consistently outperform their non-reasoning
counterparts and expert OCR models, which proves the effectiveness of our
method.

*Sumaiya Fazal,Sheeraz Ahmed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于卷积神经网络的乌尔都语光学字符识别系统，通过组件分类和自动特征学习实现了高准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乌尔都语作为一种手写体语言，具有复杂的几何和形态结构，传统的分割基于识别方法很容易出错

Method: 使用卷积神经网络(CNN)进行自动特征学习，通过三个字符的排列组合生成数据集，并使用连通组件技术获取细体，采用两层层次神经网络处理三级字符排列和组件分类

Result: 模型在组件分类任务上达到了0.99%的高准确率

Conclusion: 基于CNN的组件分类方法能够有效处理乌尔都语的复杂字符识别问题，提供了高精度的解决方案

Abstract: Urdu is a cursive script language and has similarities with Arabic and many
other South Asian languages. Urdu is difficult to classify due to its complex
geometrical and morphological structure. Character classification can be
processed further if segmentation technique is efficient, but due to context
sensitivity in Urdu, segmentation-based recognition often results with high
error rate. Our proposed approach for Urdu optical character recognition system
is a component-based classification relying on automatic feature learning
technique called convolutional neural network. CNN is trained and tested on
Urdu text dataset, which is generated through permutation process of three
characters and further proceeds to discarding unnecessary images by applying
connected component technique in order to obtain ligature only. Hierarchical
neural network is implemented with two levels to deal with three degrees of
character permutations and component classification Our model successfully
achieved 0.99% for component classification.

### [5] [CLoE: Curriculum Learning on Endoscopic Images for Robust MES Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13280)
*Zeynep Ozdemir,Hacer Yalim Keles,Omer Ozgur Tanriover*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLoE是一个课程学习框架，通过图像质量评估标签可靠性并考虑MES评分的序数特性，在结肠炎内窥镜图像分类中显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mayo内窥镜评分(MES)分类面临观察者间变异导致的标签噪声问题，且标准模型忽略了评分的序数特性，需要开发能够同时处理标签可靠性和序数结构的框架

Method: 使用基于波士顿肠道准备量表(BBPS)训练的轻量级模型估计图像质量作为标注置信度代理，构建从易(干净)到难(噪声)的课程学习顺序，结合ResizeMix增强提高鲁棒性

Result: 在LIMUC和HyperKvasir数据集上，CLoE在CNN和Transformer模型上均表现优异，ConvNeXt-Tiny达到82.5%准确率和0.894 QWK，计算成本低

Conclusion: 难度感知的训练策略能有效改善标签不确定性下的序数分类性能，CLoE框架具有实际应用潜力

Abstract: Estimating disease severity from endoscopic images is essential in assessing
ulcerative colitis, where the Mayo Endoscopic Subscore (MES) is widely used to
grade inflammation. However, MES classification remains challenging due to
label noise from inter-observer variability and the ordinal nature of the
score, which standard models often ignore. We propose CLoE, a curriculum
learning framework that accounts for both label reliability and ordinal
structure. Image quality, estimated via a lightweight model trained on Boston
Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) labels, is used as a proxy for annotation
confidence to order samples from easy (clean) to hard (noisy). This curriculum
is further combined with ResizeMix augmentation to improve robustness.
Experiments on the LIMUC and HyperKvasir datasets, using both CNNs and
Transformers, show that CLoE consistently improves performance over strong
supervised and self-supervised baselines. For instance, ConvNeXt-Tiny reaches
82.5\% accuracy and a QWK of 0.894 on LIMUC with low computational cost. These
results highlight the potential of difficulty-aware training strategies for
improving ordinal classification under label uncertainty. Code will be released
at https://github.com/zeynepozdemir/CLoE.

### [6] [GaitCrafter: Diffusion Model for Biometric Preserving Gait Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13300)
*Sirshapan Mitra,Yogesh S. Rawat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GaitCrafter是一个基于扩散模型的步态序列生成框架，能够在轮廓域合成逼真的步态数据，支持多种条件控制，并能生成新身份数据以保护隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 步态识别受限于大规模标注数据集的缺乏和收集多样化步态样本的困难，同时需要保护个人隐私。

Method: 训练一个专门针对步态轮廓数据的视频扩散模型，从头开始生成时间一致且保持身份特征的步态序列，支持服装、携带物品、视角等多种条件的控制。

Result: 将GaitCrafter生成的合成样本加入步态识别流程能提升性能，特别是在挑战性条件下；通过身份嵌入插值能生成不在原始数据集中的新身份数据。

Conclusion: 该工作为利用扩散模型进行高质量、可控且隐私保护的步态数据生成迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Gait recognition is a valuable biometric task that enables the identification
of individuals from a distance based on their walking patterns. However, it
remains limited by the lack of large-scale labeled datasets and the difficulty
of collecting diverse gait samples for each individual while preserving
privacy. To address these challenges, we propose GaitCrafter, a diffusion-based
framework for synthesizing realistic gait sequences in the silhouette domain.
Unlike prior works that rely on simulated environments or alternative
generative models, GaitCrafter trains a video diffusion model from scratch,
exclusively on gait silhouette data. Our approach enables the generation of
temporally consistent and identity-preserving gait sequences. Moreover, the
generation process is controllable-allowing conditioning on various covariates
such as clothing, carried objects, and view angle. We show that incorporating
synthetic samples generated by GaitCrafter into the gait recognition pipeline
leads to improved performance, especially under challenging conditions.
Additionally, we introduce a mechanism to generate novel identities-synthetic
individuals not present in the original dataset-by interpolating identity
embeddings. These novel identities exhibit unique, consistent gait patterns and
are useful for training models while maintaining privacy of real subjects.
Overall, our work takes an important step toward leveraging diffusion models
for high-quality, controllable, and privacy-aware gait data generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶系统中的多视角视觉语言模型处理高分辨率多视图图像时会产生大量视觉token，导致计算开销巨大、推理延迟高和内存消耗大，阻碍了实际部署。

Result: 在两个大规模多视角驾驶基准测试中，当仅保留10%视觉token时，预填充阶段实现6.40倍加速，消耗13.4%原始FLOPs，在DriveLM基准上性能仅下降3%。

Conclusion: Prune2Drive是一种有效的视觉token剪枝解决方案，能够显著提升多视角视觉语言模型在自动驾驶中的计算效率，同时保持任务性能，具有实际部署价值。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm in
autonomous driving (AD), offering a unified framework for perception,
reasoning, and decision-making by jointly modeling visual inputs and natural
language instructions. However, their deployment is hindered by the significant
computational overhead incurred when processing high-resolution, multi-view
images, a standard setup in AD systems with six or more synchronized cameras.
This overhead stems from the large number of visual tokens generated during
encoding, increasing inference latency and memory consumption due to the
quadratic complexity of self-attention. To address these challenges, we propose
Prune2Drive, a plug-and-play visual token pruning framework for multi-view VLMs
in autonomous driving. Prune2Drive introduces two core innovations: (i) a
diversity-aware token selection mechanism inspired by farthest point sampling,
which prioritizes semantic and spatial coverage across views rather than
relying solely on attention scores, and (ii) a view-adaptive pruning controller
that learns optimal pruning ratios for each camera view based on their
importance to downstream driving tasks. Unlike prior methods, Prune2Drive does
not require model retraining or access to attention maps, making it compatible
with modern efficient attention implementations. Extensive experiments on two
large-scale multi-view driving benchmarks, DriveLM and DriveLMM-o1, show that
Prune2Drive achieves significant speedups and memory savings while maintaining
or improving task performance. When retaining only 10% of the visual tokens,
our method achieves a 6.40$\times$ speedup in the prefilling phase and consumes
13.4% of the original FLOPs, with only a 3% performance drop on the DriveLM
benchmark.

### [8] [DAASH: A Meta-Attack Framework for Synthesizing Effective and Stealthy Adversarial Examples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13309)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAASH是一个完全可微分的元攻击框架，通过策略性地组合现有的Lp范数攻击方法，生成有效且感知对齐的对抗样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Lp范数约束对抗样本往往与人类感知不一致，且不清楚Lp约束攻击的见解是否能有效提升感知效果。

Method: 多阶段框架：每阶段聚合多个基础攻击的候选对抗样本，使用学习到的自适应权重，并通过新颖的元损失函数联合最小化误分类损失和感知失真。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet上显著优于最先进的感知攻击AdvAD，攻击成功率提高20.63%，SSIM、LPIPS和FID指标分别提升约11、0.015和5.7。

Conclusion: DAASH能够很好地泛化到未见过的防御方法，是评估鲁棒性的实用且强大的基准，无需为每个新防御手工设计自适应攻击。

Abstract: Numerous techniques have been proposed for generating adversarial examples in
white-box settings under strict Lp-norm constraints. However, such norm-bounded
examples often fail to align well with human perception, and only recently have
a few methods begun specifically exploring perceptually aligned adversarial
examples. Moreover, it remains unclear whether insights from Lp-constrained
attacks can be effectively leveraged to improve perceptual efficacy. In this
paper, we introduce DAASH, a fully differentiable meta-attack framework that
generates effective and perceptually aligned adversarial examples by
strategically composing existing Lp-based attack methods. DAASH operates in a
multi-stage fashion: at each stage, it aggregates candidate adversarial
examples from multiple base attacks using learned, adaptive weights and
propagates the result to the next stage. A novel meta-loss function guides this
process by jointly minimizing misclassification loss and perceptual distortion,
enabling the framework to dynamically modulate the contribution of each base
attack throughout the stages. We evaluate DAASH on adversarially trained models
across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. Despite relying solely on
Lp-constrained based methods, DAASH significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
perceptual attacks such as AdvAD -- achieving higher attack success rates
(e.g., 20.63\% improvement) and superior visual quality, as measured by SSIM,
LPIPS, and FID (improvements $\approx$ of 11, 0.015, and 5.7, respectively).
Furthermore, DAASH generalizes well to unseen defenses, making it a practical
and strong baseline for evaluating robustness without requiring handcrafted
adaptive attacks for each new defense.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提供可重复、定量的评估标准，支持数据驱动的手术规划、患者咨询和客观效果评估

Method: 利用自动化关键点检测、几何面部对称计算、深度学习基于年龄估计和鼻部形态分析的处理流程

Result: 在鼻整形子集中96.2%患者至少一项鼻部指标改善，在更大的正面照片组中71.3%患者面部对称或观感年龄显著改善，同时保持了69.5%-99.6%的患者身份识别精度

Conclusion: 该框架为面部整形外科提供了可重复、定量的评估方法，有助于数据驱动的手术规划和客观效果评估

Abstract: We introduce a scalable, interpretable computer-vision framework for
quantifying aesthetic outcomes of facial plastic surgery using frontal
photographs. Our pipeline leverages automated landmark detection, geometric
facial symmetry computation, deep-learning-based age estimation, and nasal
morphology analysis. To perform this study, we first assemble the largest
curated dataset of paired pre- and post-operative facial images to date,
encompassing 7,160 photographs from 1,259 patients. This dataset includes a
dedicated rhinoplasty-only subset consisting of 732 images from 366 patients,
96.2% of whom showed improvement in at least one of the three nasal
measurements with statistically significant group-level change. Among these
patients, the greatest statistically significant improvements (p < 0.001)
occurred in the alar width to face width ratio (77.0%), nose length to face
height ratio (41.5%), and alar width to intercanthal ratio (39.3%). Among the
broader frontal-view cohort, comprising 989 rigorously filtered subjects, 71.3%
exhibited significant enhancements in global facial symmetry or perceived age
(p < 0.01). Importantly, our analysis shows that patient identity remains
consistent post-operatively, with True Match Rates of 99.5% and 99.6% at a
False Match Rate of 0.01% for the rhinoplasty-specific and general patient
cohorts, respectively. Additionally, we analyze inter-practitioner variability
in improvement rates. By providing reproducible, quantitative benchmarks and a
novel dataset, our pipeline facilitates data-driven surgical planning, patient
counseling, and objective outcome evaluation across practices.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in natural
language processing and multi-modal understanding. However, their high
computational cost, limited accessibility, and data privacy concerns hinder
their adoption in resource-constrained healthcare environments. This study
investigates the performance of small language models (SLMs) in a medical
imaging classification task, comparing different models and prompt designs to
identify the optimal combination for accuracy and usability. Using the NIH
Chest X-ray dataset, we evaluate multiple SLMs on the task of classifying chest
X-ray positions (anteroposterior [AP] vs. posteroanterior [PA]) under three
prompt strategies: baseline instruction, incremental summary prompts, and
correction-based reflective prompts. Our results show that certain SLMs achieve
competitive accuracy with well-crafted prompts, suggesting that prompt
engineering can substantially enhance SLM performance in healthcare
applications without requiring deep AI expertise from end users.

learning architectures, domain adaptation techniques, pretrained models, and
domain generalization strategies to improve performance under diverse
conditions.
  This report outlines the dataset details, competition framework, evaluation
metrics, and final results, providing insights into the current state of rip
current segmentation. We conclude with a discussion of key challenges, lessons
learned from the submissions, and future directions for expanding RipSeg.

### [12] [Mitigating Easy Option Bias in Multiple-Choice Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13428)
*Hao Zhang,Chen Li,Basura Fernando*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现多选项VQA数据集存在Easy-Options偏差(EOB)，视觉-语言模型仅通过视觉和选项就能猜出正确答案。研究提出了GroundAttack工具来生成难以区分的负面选项，创建了无EOB偏差的数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现当前多选项VQA数据集存在偏差，模型可以不依赖问题仅通过视觉和选项就能做出正确选择，这影响了对VLM真实能力的评估。

Method: 通过grounding实验归因EOB偏差到视觉相关性不平衡：正确答案在特征空间中与视觉内容更为一致。提出GroundAttack工具来自动生成视觉上可信的难以区分的负面选项。

Result: 在新创建的EOB-free数据集上，当前VLM在仅使用视觉+选项的情况下几乎随机猜测，在视觉+问题+选项的情况下准确率也下降到非饱和水平，提供了更现实的VLM能力评估。

Conclusion: 这项研究揭示了多选项VQA数据集中的偏差问题，并提供了一种解决方案，为更准确地评估视觉-语言模型的真实问答能力提供了基础。

Abstract: In this early study, we observe an Easy-Options Bias (EOB) issue in some
multiple-choice Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks such as MMStar,
RealWorldQA, SEED-Bench, Next-QA, STAR benchmark and Video-MME. This bias
allows vision-language models (VLMs) to select the correct answer using only
the vision (V) and options (O) as inputs, without the need for the question
(Q). Through grounding experiments, we attribute the bias to an imbalance in
visual relevance: the correct answer typically aligns more closely with the
visual contents than the negative options in feature space, creating a shortcut
for VLMs to infer the answer via simply vision-option similarity matching. To
fix this, we introduce GroundAttack, a toolkit that automatically generates
hard negative options as visually plausible as the correct answer. We apply it
to the NExT-QA and MMStar datasets, creating new EOB-free annotations. On these
EOB-free annotations, current VLMs approach to random accuracies under (V+O)
settings, and drop to non-saturated accuracies under (V+Q+O) settings,
providing a more realistic evaluation of VLMs' QA ability. Codes and new
annotations will be released soon.

Abstract: Comprehensive highway scene understanding and robust traffic risk inference
are vital for advancing Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and autonomous
driving. Traditional approaches often struggle with scalability and
generalization, particularly under the complex and dynamic conditions of
real-world environments. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
structured prompting and knowledge distillation framework that enables
automatic generation of high-quality traffic scene annotations and contextual
risk assessments. Our framework orchestrates two large Vision-Language Models
(VLMs): GPT-4o and o3-mini, using a structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategy
to produce rich, multi-perspective outputs. These outputs serve as
knowledge-enriched pseudo-annotations for supervised fine-tuning of a much
smaller student VLM. The resulting compact 3B-scale model, named VISTA (Vision
for Intelligent Scene and Traffic Analysis), is capable of understanding
low-resolution traffic videos and generating semantically faithful, risk-aware
captions. Despite its significantly reduced parameter count, VISTA achieves
strong performance across established captioning metrics (BLEU-4, METEOR,
ROUGE-L, and CIDEr) when benchmarked against its teacher models. This
demonstrates that effective knowledge distillation and structured multi-agent
supervision can empower lightweight VLMs to capture complex reasoning
capabilities. The compact architecture of VISTA facilitates efficient
deployment on edge devices, enabling real-time risk monitoring without
requiring extensive infrastructure upgrades.

Abstract: Achieving disentangled control over multiple facial motions and accommodating
diverse input modalities greatly enhances the application and entertainment of
the talking head generation. This necessitates a deep exploration of the
decoupling space for facial features, ensuring that they a) operate
independently without mutual interference and b) can be preserved to share with
different modal inputs, both aspects often neglected in existing methods. To
address this gap, this paper proposes EDTalk++, a novel full disentanglement
framework for controllable talking head generation. Our framework enables
individual manipulation of mouth shape, head pose, eye movement, and emotional
expression, conditioned on video or audio inputs. Specifically, we employ four
lightweight modules to decompose the facial dynamics into four distinct latent
spaces representing mouth, pose, eye, and expression, respectively. Each space
is characterized by a set of learnable bases whose linear combinations define
specific motions. To ensure independence and accelerate training, we enforce
orthogonality among bases and devise an efficient training strategy to allocate
motion responsibilities to each space without relying on external knowledge.
The learned bases are then stored in corresponding banks, enabling shared
visual priors with audio input. Furthermore, considering the properties of each
space, we propose an Audio-to-Motion module for audio-driven talking head
synthesis. Experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of
EDTalk++.

Abstract: Kidney stone classification from endoscopic images is critical for
personalized treatment and recurrence prevention. While convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) have shown promise in this task, their limited ability to
capture long-range dependencies can hinder performance under variable imaging
conditions. This study presents a comparative analysis between Vision
Transformers (ViTs) and CNN-based models, evaluating their performance on two
ex vivo datasets comprising CCD camera and flexible ureteroscope images. The
ViT-base model pretrained on ImageNet-21k consistently outperformed a ResNet50
baseline across multiple imaging conditions. For instance, in the most visually
complex subset (Section patches from endoscopic images), the ViT model achieved
95.2% accuracy and 95.1% F1-score, compared to 64.5% and 59.3% with ResNet50.
In the mixed-view subset from CCD-camera images, ViT reached 87.1% accuracy
versus 78.4% with CNN. These improvements extend across precision and recall as
well. The results demonstrate that ViT-based architectures provide superior
classification performance and offer a scalable alternative to conventional
CNNs for kidney stone image analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的隐式神经表示(INR)为每张图像使用单独的MLP网络，导致编码多张图像时计算和存储效率低下

Method: 分析训练好的INR网络层间权重分布，发现中间层具有高度相似的分布模式。因此共享中间层，保留输入输出层为图像专用，并为每张图像设计额外的投影层来捕获独特特征

Result: 在图像重建和超分辨率任务中，MINR节省60%参数的同时保持可比性能，可处理100张图像并维持34dB的平均PSNR

Conclusion: MINR方法证明了共享中间层的有效性，在各种骨干网络上都表现出鲁棒性，为多图像高效编码提供了可行方案

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) aim to parameterize discrete signals
through implicit continuous functions. However, formulating each image with a
separate neural network~(typically, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)) leads to
computational and storage inefficiencies when encoding multi-images. To address
this issue, we propose MINR, sharing specific layers to encode multi-image
efficiently. We first compare the layer-wise weight distributions for several
trained INRs and find that corresponding intermediate layers follow highly
similar distribution patterns. Motivated by this, we share these intermediate
layers across multiple images while preserving the input and output layers as
input-specific. In addition, we design an extra novel projection layer for each
image to capture its unique features. Experimental results on image
reconstruction and super-resolution tasks demonstrate that MINR can save up to
60\% parameters while maintaining comparable performance. Particularly, MINR
scales effectively to handle 100 images, maintaining an average peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 34 dB. Further analysis of various backbones
proves the robustness of the proposed MINR.

TL;DR: DHQ是一种针对隐式神经表示(INR)的分布感知哈达玛量化方案，同时对权重和激活进行量化，通过哈达玛变换将不同分布统一为标准钟形分布，显著提升硬件效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的INR量化方法主要关注权重量化，缺乏激活量化，硬件节省有限。INR中不同层的权重和激活分布差异显著，需要统一的量化方案来充分利用量化带来的硬件优势。

Method: 提出DHQ方案，利用哈达玛变换将不同层的权重和激活的多样化分布标准化为统一的钟形分布，然后应用标准量化器。这种方法避免了为每个分布定制量化器的复杂性。

Result: 在多种图像重建任务上，DHQ相比全精度版本减少了32.7%的延迟、40.1%的能耗，资源利用率最高降低了98.3%，性能优于之前的量化方法。

Conclusion: DHQ通过分布感知的哈达玛量化有效解决了INR中权重和激活分布差异问题，实现了显著的硬件效率提升，为INR的实际部署提供了高效的量化解决方案。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals using
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) with complex activation functions. While INRs
achieve superior performance, they depend on full-precision number
representation for accurate computation, resulting in significant hardware
overhead. Previous INR quantization approaches have primarily focused on weight
quantization, offering only limited hardware savings due to the lack of
activation quantization. To fully exploit the hardware benefits of
quantization, we propose DHQ, a novel distribution-aware Hadamard quantization
scheme that targets both weights and activations in INRs. Our analysis shows
that the weights in the first and last layers have distributions distinct from
those in the intermediate layers, while the activations in the last layer
differ significantly from those in the preceding layers. Instead of customizing
quantizers individually, we utilize the Hadamard transformation to standardize
these diverse distributions into a unified bell-shaped form, supported by both
empirical evidence and theoretical analysis, before applying a standard
quantizer. To demonstrate the practical advantages of our approach, we present
an FPGA implementation of DHQ that highlights its hardware efficiency.
Experiments on diverse image reconstruction tasks show that DHQ outperforms
previous quantization methods, reducing latency by 32.7\%, energy consumption
by 40.1\%, and resource utilization by up to 98.3\% compared to full-precision
counterparts.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals in a
continuous manner using neural networks, demonstrating significant value across
various multimedia applications. However, the vulnerability of INRs presents a
critical challenge for their real-world deployments, as the network weights
might be subjected to unavoidable perturbations. In this work, we investigate
the robustness of INRs for the first time and find that even minor
perturbations can lead to substantial performance degradation in the quality of
signal reconstruction. To mitigate this issue, we formulate the robustness
problem in INRs by minimizing the difference between loss with and without
weight perturbations. Furthermore, we derive a novel robust loss function to
regulate the gradient of the reconstruction loss with respect to weights,
thereby enhancing the robustness. Extensive experiments on reconstruction tasks
across multiple modalities demonstrate that our method achieves up to a 7.5~dB
improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) values compared to original
INRs under noisy conditions.

Conclusion: FAMNet通过2D/3D CNN融合和多任务学习，能够有效提取微表情的全方位特征，显著提升了微表情识别的性能

Abstract: Micro-expressions recognition (MER) has essential application value in many
fields, but the short duration and low intensity of micro-expressions (MEs)
bring considerable challenges to MER. The current MER methods in deep learning
mainly include three data loading methods: static images, dynamic image
sequence, and a combination of the two streams. How to effectively extract MEs'
fine-grained and spatiotemporal features has been difficult to solve. This
paper proposes a new MER method based on multi-task learning and hierarchical
attention, which fully extracts MEs' omni-directional features by merging 2D
and 3D CNNs. The fusion model consists of a 2D CNN AMNet2D and a 3D CNN
AMNet3D, with similar structures consisting of a shared backbone network
Resnet18 and attention modules. During training, the model adopts different
data loading methods to adapt to two specific networks respectively, jointly
trains on the tasks of MER and facial action unit detection (FAUD), and adopts
the parameter hard sharing for information association, which further improves
the effect of the MER task, and the final fused model is called FAMNet.
Extensive experimental results show that our proposed FAMNet significantly
improves task performance. On the SAMM, CASME II and MMEW datasets, FAMNet
achieves 83.75% (UAR) and 84.03% (UF1). Furthermore, on the challenging
CAS(ME)$^3$ dataset, FAMNet achieves 51% (UAR) and 43.42% (UF1).

Abstract: 4D radar-based object detection has garnered great attention for its
robustness in adverse weather conditions and capacity to deliver rich spatial
information across diverse driving scenarios. Nevertheless, the sparse and
noisy nature of 4D radar point clouds poses substantial challenges for
effective perception. To address the limitation, we present CORENet, a novel

noise patterns and extract discriminative features from raw 4D radar data.
Designed as a plug-and-play architecture, our solution enables seamless
integration into voxel-based detection frameworks without modifying existing
pipelines. Notably, the proposed method only utilizes LiDAR data for
cross-modal supervision during training while maintaining full radar-only
operation during inference. Extensive evaluation on the challenging Dual-Radar
dataset, which is characterized by elevated noise level, demonstrates the
effectiveness of our framework in enhancing detection robustness. Comprehensive
experiments validate that CORENet achieves superior performance compared to
existing mainstream approaches.

Conclusion: BDCL框架通过双层解耦和一致性学习有效提升了多视图聚类的性能，增强了特征的簇间区分度和簇内紧凑性

Abstract: Multi-view clustering has shown to be an effective method for analyzing
underlying patterns in multi-view data. The performance of clustering can be
improved by learning the consistency and complementarity between multi-view
features, however, cluster-oriented representation learning is often
overlooked. In this paper, we propose a novel Bi-level Decoupling and
Consistency Learning framework (BDCL) to further explore the effective
representation for multi-view data to enhance inter-cluster discriminability
and intra-cluster compactness of features in multi-view clustering. Our
framework comprises three modules: 1) The multi-view instance learning module
aligns the consistent information while preserving the private features between
views through reconstruction autoencoder and contrastive learning. 2) The
bi-level decoupling of features and clusters enhances the discriminability of
feature space and cluster space. 3) The consistency learning module treats the
different views of the sample and their neighbors as positive pairs, learns the
consistency of their clustering assignments, and further compresses the
intra-cluster space. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared with the SOTA
methods. Our code is published on https://github.com/LouisDong95/BDCL.

Motivation: 现有HDR技术忽视了快门速度和ISO的复杂交互作用，以及动态场景中运动模糊的影响，导致高ISO产生噪声而长曝光时间造成模糊

Method: 使用强化学习优化快门速度和ISO组合选择，集成包含运动模糊和噪声模拟的图像合成流程，利用语义信息和曝光直方图进行训练

Result: 在多个数据集上达到最先进性能，能够根据用户定义的曝光时间预算自适应地选择最优曝光策略

Conclusion: AdaptiveAE方法能够有效解决动态HDR拍摄中的曝光参数优化问题，提供比传统方法更好的曝光调度方案

Abstract: Mainstream high dynamic range imaging techniques typically rely on fusing
multiple images captured with different exposure setups (shutter speed and
ISO). A good balance between shutter speed and ISO is crucial for achieving
high-quality HDR, as high ISO values introduce significant noise, while long
shutter speeds can lead to noticeable motion blur. However, existing methods
often overlook the complex interaction between shutter speed and ISO and fail
to account for motion blur effects in dynamic scenes.
  In this work, we propose AdaptiveAE, a reinforcement learning-based method
that optimizes the selection of shutter speed and ISO combinations to maximize
HDR reconstruction quality in dynamic environments. AdaptiveAE integrates an
image synthesis pipeline that incorporates motion blur and noise simulation
into our training procedure, leveraging semantic information and exposure
histograms. It can adaptively select optimal ISO and shutter speed sequences
based on a user-defined exposure time budget, and find a better exposure
schedule than traditional solutions. Experimental results across multiple
datasets demonstrate that it achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Badminton is known as one of the fastest racket sports in the world. Despite
doubles matches being more prevalent in international tournaments than singles,
previous research has mainly focused on singles due to the challenges in data
availability and multi-person tracking. To address this gap, we designed an
approach that transfers singles-trained models to doubles analysis. We
extracted keypoints from the ShuttleSet single matches dataset using ViT-Pose
and embedded them through a contrastive learning framework based on ST-GCN. To
improve tracking stability, we incorporated a custom multi-object tracking
algorithm that resolves ID switching issues from fast and overlapping player
movements. A Transformer-based classifier then determines shot occurrences
based on the learned embeddings. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of
extending pose-based shot recognition to doubles badminton, broadening
analytics capabilities. This work establishes a foundation for doubles-specific
datasets to enhance understanding of this predominant yet understudied format
of the fast racket sport.

Motivation: 现有的量化基于标记化器（如VQ-GAN）主要关注外观特征，忽视了几何结构，因此需要一种能够更好地编码结构信息的新方法。

Method: 提出了Visual Gaussian Quantization (VGQ)框架，将传统视觉码本量化与2D高斯分布相结合，通过建模位置、旋转和缩放等参数来显式地捐捕几何结构。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256测试上，VGQ达到了rFID 1.00的强劲重建质量。通过增加高斯密度，进一步获得rFID 0.556和PSNR 24.93的最优结果，显著超过现有方法。

Conclusion: VGQ通过引入高斯建模有效地解决了传统标记化器在结构表征方面的不足，为图像生成提供了更丰富的视觉表征。

Abstract: The image tokenizer is a critical component in AR image generation, as it
determines how rich and structured visual content is encoded into compact
representations. Existing quantization-based tokenizers such as VQ-GAN
primarily focus on appearance features like texture and color, often neglecting
geometric structures due to their patch-based design. In this work, we explored
how to incorporate more visual information into the tokenizer and proposed a
new framework named Visual Gaussian Quantization (VGQ), a novel tokenizer
paradigm that explicitly enhances structural modeling by integrating 2D
Gaussians into traditional visual codebook quantization frameworks. Our
approach addresses the inherent limitations of naive quantization methods such
as VQ-GAN, which struggle to model structured visual information due to their
patch-based design and emphasis on texture and color. In contrast, VGQ encodes
image latents as 2D Gaussian distributions, effectively capturing geometric and
spatial structures by directly modeling structure-related parameters such as
position, rotation and scale. We further demonstrate that increasing the
density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens leads to significant gains in
reconstruction fidelity, providing a flexible trade-off between token
efficiency and visual richness. On the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, VGQ achieves
strong reconstruction quality with an rFID score of 1.00. Furthermore, by
increasing the density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens, VGQ gains a
significant boost in reconstruction capability and achieves a state-of-the-art
reconstruction rFID score of 0.556 and a PSNR of 24.93, substantially
outperforming existing methods. Codes will be released soon.

Motivation: 深度学习中观测样本与真实分布存在空间差距，来自采样偏差、噪声等原因，需要找到有效方法来减小这个差距

Method: 利用CLIP、DINOv2等基础模型提取特征，分析特征分布的几何形状，并在联邦学习和长尾识别两个场景中实现分布检查框架

Result: 综合实验表明，该方法能够有效克服数据异质性和样本不平衡导致的信息缺失，在各个基准测试中都取得了性能提升

Conclusion: 基础模型特征的几何形状具有跨领域的可转移性，基于此的分布检查框架为解决数据偏差和样本不平衡问题提供了有效方案

Abstract: Despite the fast progress of deep learning, one standing challenge is the gap
of the observed training samples and the underlying true distribution. There
are multiple reasons for the causing of this gap e.g. sampling bias, noise etc.
In the era of foundation models, we show that when leveraging the off-the-shelf
(vision) foundation models (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2) for feature extraction, the
geometric shapes of the resulting feature distributions exhibit remarkable
transferability across domains and datasets. To verify its practical
usefulness, we embody our geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration
framework in two popular and challenging settings: federated learning and
long-tailed recognition. In the federated setting, we devise a technique of
acquiring the global geometric shape under privacy constraints, then leverage
this knowledge to generate new samples for clients, in the aim of bridging the
gap between local and global observations. In long-tailed learning, it utilizes
the geometric knowledge transferred from sample-rich categories to recover the
true distribution for sample-scarce tail classes. Comprehensive experiments
show that our proposed geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration
effectively overcomes information deficits caused by data heterogeneity and
sample imbalance, with boosted performance across benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文首次实证比较了开源视觉语言模型（Phi-3.5 Vision和CLIP）与传统深度学习模型（VGG19、ResNet-50、EfficientNet-B0）在FER-2013数据集上的面部情绪识别性能，发现传统模型显著优于VLMs，并提出了包含图像恢复的创新评估流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面部情绪识别在人际交互和心理健康诊断中至关重要，但现有研究缺乏对视觉语言模型在低质量噪声数据环境下性能的系统评估，需要探索VLMs在此类实际应用场景中的适用性。

Method: 提出新颖的pipeline，整合GFPGAN图像恢复技术与FER评估，在FER-2013数据集（35,887张低分辨率灰度图像，7种情绪类别）上对比VLMs（Phi-3.5 Vision、CLIP）和传统深度学习模型（VGG19、ResNet-50、EfficientNet-B0）的性能。

Result: 传统模型显著优于VLMs：EfficientNet-B0达到86.44%准确率，ResNet-50为85.72%，而CLIP仅64.07%，Phi-3.5 Vision仅51.66%。同时提供了包含预处理、训练、推理和评估阶段的详细计算成本分析。

Conclusion: VLMs在低质量视觉任务中存在明显局限性，需要针对噪声环境进行专门适配。本研究为情绪识别领域提供了可复现的基准，强调了在实际部署中考虑模型适用性的重要性。

Abstract: Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) is crucial for applications such as
human-computer interaction and mental health diagnostics. This study presents
the first empirical comparison of open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs),
including Phi-3.5 Vision and CLIP, against traditional deep learning models
VGG19, ResNet-50, and EfficientNet-B0 on the challenging FER-2013 dataset,
which contains 35,887 low-resolution grayscale images across seven emotion
classes. To address the mismatch between VLM training assumptions and the noisy
nature of FER data, we introduce a novel pipeline that integrates GFPGAN-based
image restoration with FER evaluation. Results show that traditional models,
particularly EfficientNet-B0 (86.44%) and ResNet-50 (85.72%), significantly
outperform VLMs like CLIP (64.07%) and Phi-3.5 Vision (51.66%), highlighting
the limitations of VLMs in low-quality visual tasks. In addition to performance
evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy, we provide a
detailed computational cost analysis covering preprocessing, training,
inference, and evaluation phases, offering practical insights for deployment.
This work underscores the need for adapting VLMs to noisy environments and
provides a reproducible benchmark for future research in emotion recognition.

Motivation: 当前3DGS基于的头部虚拟人重建方法在捕捉细细微面部表惉和保持局部纹理连续性方面面临挑战，特别是在高变形区域。

Method: 提出EAvatar框架，使用少量关键高斯来影响邻近高斯的变形，实现精确局部变形模型。利用预训练生成模型的高质量3D先验知识提供可靠面部几何指导。

Result: 实验结果显示方法能够生成更准确、视觉一致的头部重建结果，表惉控制性和细节保真度都得到显著提升。

Conclusion: EAvatar框架通过表惉感知和变形感知的设计，有效解决了现有3DGS方法在高保真头部虚拟人重建中的问题，为AR/VR等应用领域提供了更优秀的解决方案。

Abstract: High-fidelity head avatar reconstruction plays a crucial role in AR/VR,
gaming, and multimedia content creation. Recent advances in 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated effectiveness in modeling complex geometry
with real-time rendering capability and are now widely used in high-fidelity
head avatar reconstruction tasks. However, existing 3DGS-based methods still
face significant challenges in capturing fine-grained facial expressions and
preserving local texture continuity, especially in highly deformable regions.
To mitigate these limitations, we propose a novel 3DGS-based framework termed
EAvatar for head reconstruction that is both expression-aware and
deformation-aware. Our method introduces a sparse expression control mechanism,
where a small number of key Gaussians are used to influence the deformation of
their neighboring Gaussians, enabling accurate modeling of local deformations
and fine-scale texture transitions. Furthermore, we leverage high-quality 3D
priors from pretrained generative models to provide a more reliable facial
geometry, offering structural guidance that improves convergence stability and
shape accuracy during training. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method produces more accurate and visually coherent head reconstructions with
improved expression controllability and detail fidelity.

<details>

Motivation: 现有隐式神经表示缺乏频率选择性、空间局部性和稀疏表示，导致过度依赖冗余信号分量，表现出频谱偏差，难以捕捉高频细节

Method: 提出FLAIR方法，包含两个关键创新：1) RC-GAUSS激活函数，在时频不确定性原理约束下实现显式频率选择和空间局部化；2) 小波能量引导编码(WEGE)，利用离散小波变换计算能量分数并显式引导频率信息

Result: 在2D图像表示与恢复以及3D重建任务中，该方法始终优于现有隐式神经表示方法

Conclusion: FLAIR通过引入频率选择和空间局部化机制，有效解决了隐式神经表示中的频谱偏差问题，提升了高频细节的捕捉能力

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) leverage neural networks to map
coordinates to corresponding signals, enabling continuous and compact
representations. This paradigm has driven significant advances in various
vision tasks. However, existing INRs lack frequency selectivity, spatial
localization, and sparse representations, leading to an over-reliance on
redundant signal components. Consequently, they exhibit spectral bias, tending
to learn low-frequency components early while struggling to capture fine
high-frequency details. To address these issues, we propose FLAIR (Frequency-
and Locality-Aware Implicit Neural Representations), which incorporates two key
innovations. The first is RC-GAUSS, a novel activation designed for explicit
frequency selection and spatial localization under the constraints of the
time-frequency uncertainty principle (TFUP). The second is
Wavelet-Energy-Guided Encoding (WEGE), which leverages the discrete wavelet
transform (DWT) to compute energy scores and explicitly guide frequency
information to the network. Our method consistently outperforms existing INRs
in 2D image representation and restoration, as well as 3D reconstruction.

Motivation: 当前基于硬件的眼动追踪系统成本高、校准复杂且硬件兼容性受限，限制了注视点渲染技术的广泛应用。需要开发纯软件解决方案来降低部署门槛。

Method: 使用球形视觉变换器处理360度VR场景，结合LSTM时序编码器捕捉注视序列模式，通过多模态融合网络整合空间场景特征和时序注视动态来预测未来注视位置并提供置信度估计。

Result: 在综合VR数据集上的实验显示，GazeProphet实现了3.83度的中位角误差，比传统显著性基线方法提升24%，同时提供可靠的置信度校准，在不同空间区域和场景类型中保持稳定性能。

Conclusion: 纯软件注视预测可以有效地用于VR注视点渲染，使性能提升更加普及，适用于不同的VR平台和应用，无需额外硬件要求。

Abstract: Foveated rendering significantly reduces computational demands in virtual
reality applications by concentrating rendering quality where users focus their
gaze. Current approaches require expensive hardware-based eye tracking systems,
limiting widespread adoption due to cost, calibration complexity, and hardware
compatibility constraints. This paper presents GazeProphet, a software-only
approach for predicting gaze locations in VR environments without requiring
dedicated eye tracking hardware. The approach combines a Spherical Vision
Transformer for processing 360-degree VR scenes with an LSTM-based temporal
encoder that captures gaze sequence patterns. A multi-modal fusion network
integrates spatial scene features with temporal gaze dynamics to predict future
gaze locations with associated confidence estimates. Experimental evaluation on
a comprehensive VR dataset demonstrates that GazeProphet achieves a median
angular error of 3.83 degrees, outperforming traditional saliency-based
baselines by 24% while providing reliable confidence calibration. The approach
maintains consistent performance across different spatial regions and scene
types, enabling practical deployment in VR systems without additional hardware
requirements. Statistical analysis confirms the significance of improvements
across all evaluation metrics. These results show that software-only gaze
prediction can work for VR foveated rendering, making this performance boost
more accessible to different VR platforms and apps.

Motivation: 生成式人脸视频编码虽然通过深度生成模型获得优异的码率夺真性能，但大规模模型参数和高计算成本阻碍了其实际部署。

Method: 提出双模式优化方法：结构方面用更薄、更高效的层替换传统3x3卷积；操作方面开发两阶段适配性通道剪枝策略，包括训练期的软剪枝和训练后的硬剪枝。

Result: 实验结果显示，方法实现了90.4%的参数缩减和88.9%的计算节省，同时在感知质量指标上超过最先进的VVC视频编码标准。

Conclusion: 该方法有望在资源受限环境（如移动边缘设备）中实现高效的生成式人脸视频编码部署。

Abstract: Generative Face Video Coding (GFVC) achieves superior rate-distortion
performance by leveraging the strong inference capabilities of deep generative
models. However, its practical deployment is hindered by large model parameters
and high computational costs. To address this, we propose a lightweight GFVC
framework that introduces dual-mode optimization -- combining architectural
redesign and operational refinement -- to reduce complexity whilst preserving
reconstruction quality. Architecturally, we replace traditional 3 x 3
convolutions with slimmer and more efficient layers, reducing complexity
without compromising feature expressiveness. Operationally, we develop a
two-stage adaptive channel pruning strategy: (1) soft pruning during training
identifies redundant channels via learnable thresholds, and (2) hard pruning
permanently eliminates these channels post-training using a derived mask. This
dual-phase approach ensures both training stability and inference efficiency.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed lightweight dual-mode
optimization for GFVC can achieve 90.4% parameter reduction and 88.9%
computation saving compared to the baseline, whilst achieving superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art video coding standard Versatile Video
Coding (VVC) in terms of perceptual-level quality metrics. As such, the
proposed method is expected to enable efficient GFVC deployment in
resource-constrained environments such as mobile edge devices.

Result: 实验结果显示该方法能够有效增加刺刺信号的信息含量，提升SNN性能，同时遵循神经形态计算原则。

Conclusion: 这种受生物启发的方法有望突破神经形态计算的当前限制，推动SNN的更广泛应用。

Abstract: In recent years, neuromorphic computing and spiking neural networks (SNNs)
have ad-vanced rapidly through integration with deep learning. However, the
performance of SNNs still lags behind that of convolutional neural networks
(CNNs), primarily due to the limited information capacity of spike-based data.
Although some studies have attempted to improve SNN performance by training
them with non-spiking inputs such as static images, this approach deviates from
the original intent of neuromorphic computing, which emphasizes spike-based
information processing. To address this issue, we propose a Neuron-like
Encoding method that generates spike data based on the intrinsic operational
principles and functions of biological neurons. This method is further enhanced
by the incorporation of an artificial pho-toreceptor layer, enabling spike data
to carry both color and luminance information, thereby forming a complete
visual spike signal. Experimental results using the Integrate-and-Fire neuron
model demonstrate that this biologically inspired approach effectively
increases the information content of spike signals and improves SNN
performance, all while adhering to neuromorphic principles. We believe this
concept holds strong potential for future development and may contribute to
overcoming current limitations in neuro-morphic computing, facilitating broader
applications of SNNs.

TL;DR: DictAS是一个新颖的少样本异常分割框架，通过自监督学习将字典查找能力迁移到未见类别，无需目标数据重新训练，仅使用少量正常参考图像作为视觉提示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在少样本异常分割中的跨类别泛化能力严重依赖已知异常样本的先验知识，需要一种无需重新训练即可检测未见类别异常的方法。

Method: 包含三个核心组件：字典构建（使用正常参考图像特征模拟字典索引和内容）、字典查找（通过稀疏查找策略检索查询区域特征，无法检索的特征被分类为异常）、查询判别正则化（通过对比查询约束和文本对齐约束增强异常判别能力）。

Result: 在七个公共工业和医学数据集上的广泛实验表明，DictAS持续优于最先进的少样本异常分割方法。

Conclusion: DictAS通过自监督字典查找机制，成功实现了无需重新训练的跨类别异常检测，为少样本异常分割提供了新的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have demonstrated remarkable
class-generalizable ability to unseen classes in few-shot anomaly segmentation
(FSAS), leveraging supervised prompt learning or fine-tuning on seen classes.
However, their cross-category generalization largely depends on prior knowledge
of real seen anomaly samples. In this paper, we propose a novel framework,
namely DictAS, which enables a unified model to detect visual anomalies in
unseen object categories without any retraining on the target data, only
employing a few normal reference images as visual prompts. The insight behind
DictAS is to transfer dictionary lookup capabilities to the FSAS task for
unseen classes via self-supervised learning, instead of merely memorizing the
normal and abnormal feature patterns from the training set. Specifically,
DictAS mainly consists of three components: (1) **Dictionary Construction** -
to simulate the index and content of a real dictionary using features from
normal reference images. (2) **Dictionary Lookup** - to retrieve queried region
features from the dictionary via a sparse lookup strategy. When a query feature
cannot be retrieved, it is classified as an anomaly. (3) **Query Discrimination
Regularization**- to enhance anomaly discrimination by making abnormal features
harder to retrieve from the dictionary. To achieve this, Contrastive Query
Constraint and Text Alignment Constraint are further proposed. Extensive
experiments on seven public industrial and medical datasets demonstrate that
DictAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FSAS methods.

Motivation: SMPLify在3D人体姿态和形状估计中作为鲁棒基线，但其迭代优化过程计算成本高，限制了实用性。受跨领域进展启发，用数据驱动的神经网络替代迭代优化可以在不牺牲精度的情况下显著提升运行速度。

Method: 提出可学习的SMPLify框架，采用时序采样策略构建初始化-目标对进行有效训练，提出以人为中心的归一化方案和残差学习来缩小解空间，提高泛化能力。支持序列推理和插件式后处理。

Conclusion: Learnable SMPLify建立了一个实用且简单的基线，显著提高了3D人体姿态估计的效率，同时保持了良好的精度和泛化能力。

Abstract: In 3D human pose and shape estimation, SMPLify remains a robust baseline that
solves inverse kinematics (IK) through iterative optimization. However, its
high computational cost limits its practicality. Recent advances across domains
have shown that replacing iterative optimization with data-driven neural
networks can achieve significant runtime improvements without sacrificing
accuracy. Motivated by this trend, we propose Learnable SMPLify, a neural
framework that replaces the iterative fitting process in SMPLify with a
single-pass regression model. The design of our framework targets two core
challenges in neural IK: data construction and generalization. To enable
effective training, we propose a temporal sampling strategy that constructs
initialization-target pairs from sequential frames. To improve generalization
across diverse motions and unseen poses, we propose a human-centric
normalization scheme and residual learning to narrow the solution space.
Learnable SMPLify supports both sequential inference and plug-in
post-processing to refine existing image-based estimators. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method establishes itself as a practical and
simple baseline: it achieves nearly 200x faster runtime compared to SMPLify,
generalizes well to unseen 3DPW and RICH, and operates in a model-agnostic
manner when used as a plug-in tool on LucidAction. The code is available at

Abstract: Video action analysis is a foundational technology within the realm of
intelligent video comprehension, particularly concerning its application in
Internet of Things(IoT). However, existing methodologies overlook feature
semantics in feature extraction and focus on optimizing action proposals, thus
these solutions are unsuitable for widespread adoption in high-performance IoT
applications due to the limitations in precision, such as autonomous driving,
which necessitate robust and scalable intelligent video analytics analysis. To
address this issue, we propose a novel generative attention-based model to
learn the relation of feature semantics. Specifically, by leveraging the
differences of actions' foreground and background, our model simultaneously
learns the frame- and segment-dependencies of temporal action feature
semantics, which takes advantage of feature semantics in the feature extraction
effectively. To evaluate the effectiveness of our model, we conduct extensive
experiments on two benchmark video task, action recognition and action
detection. In the context of action detection tasks, we substantiate the
superiority of our approach through comprehensive validation on widely
recognized datasets. Moreover, we extend the validation of the effectiveness of
our proposed method to a broader task, video action recognition. Our code is

Conclusion: 通过重新关注分割头设计、利用扩散模型特征提取以及新的旰时间上下文提制模块，本文方法在保持模型简洁的同时显著提升了分割质量和性能。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment specific objects
in a video according to textual descriptions. We observe that recent RVOS
approaches often place excessive emphasis on feature extraction and temporal
modeling, while relatively neglecting the design of the segmentation head. In
fact, there remains considerable room for improvement in segmentation head
design. To address this, we propose a Temporal-Conditional Referring Video
Object Segmentation model, which innovatively integrates existing segmentation
methods to effectively enhance boundary segmentation capability. Furthermore,
our model leverages a text-to-video diffusion model for feature extraction. On
top of this, we remove the traditional noise prediction module to avoid the
randomness of noise from degrading segmentation accuracy, thereby simplifying
the model while improving performance. Finally, to overcome the limited feature
extraction capability of the VAE, we design a Temporal Context Mask Refinement
(TCMR) module, which significantly improves segmentation quality without
introducing complex designs. We evaluate our method on four public RVOS
benchmarks, where it consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 自动驾驶系统在恶劣天气条件下性能显著下降，而现有数据集中恶劣条件数据缺乏，直接收集和标注成本过高

Method: 提出了模拟、GAN基础和氧布-GAN混合方法的数据生成流水线，扩展现有GAN模型支持辅助输入，并使用模拟和真实图像进行训练，通过适应性混合减少Stable-Diffusion的幻觉和伪影

Result: 在ACDC数据集上，语义分割性能全面提升1.85%，夜间场景下提升4.62%

Conclusion: 混合方法能够有效提升自动驾驶系统在极端条件下的感知稳健性

Abstract: Autonomous Driving (AD) systems exhibit markedly degraded performance under
adverse environmental conditions, such as low illumination and precipitation.
The underrepresentation of adverse conditions in AD datasets makes it
challenging to address this deficiency. To circumvent the prohibitive cost of
acquiring and annotating adverse weather data, we propose a novel Domain
Adaptation (DA) pipeline that transforms clear-weather images into fog, rain,
snow, and nighttime images. Here, we systematically develop and evaluate
several novel data-generation pipelines, including simulation-only, GAN-based,
and hybrid diffusion-GAN approaches, to synthesize photorealistic adverse
images from labelled clear images. We leverage an existing DA GAN, extend it to
support auxiliary inputs, and develop a novel training recipe that leverages
both simulated and real images. The simulated images facilitate exact
supervision by providing perfectly matched image pairs, while the real images
help bridge the simulation-to-real (sim2real) gap. We further introduce a
method to mitigate hallucinations and artifacts in Stable-Diffusion
Image-to-Image (img2img) outputs by blending them adaptively with their
progenitor images. We finetune downstream models on our synthetic data and
evaluate them on the Adverse Conditions Dataset with Correspondences (ACDC). We
achieve 1.85 percent overall improvement in semantic segmentation, and 4.62
percent on nighttime, demonstrating the efficacy of our hybrid method for
robust AD perception under challenging conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MaMe是一种专门为基于状态空间模型(SSM)的视觉模型设计的token合并策略，通过利用状态转移参数Δ量化token重要性并保持序列属性，在保持性能的同时显著提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 状态空间模型在计算机视觉中表现出强大能力，但计算效率仍有待提升。虽然token减少是提高模型效率的有效方法，但将其应用于SSM时需要特别考虑其独特的序列建模能力。

Method: 提出MaMe策略：1）利用状态转移参数Δ作为信息量度量来量化token重要性；2）引入战略性token排列来保持序列信息流；3）针对SSM架构特点进行定制化设计。

Result: 实验表明MaMe在效率和性能之间取得了优越的平衡，即使在激进的token减少情况下也能保持鲁棒性。在图像分类、视频和音频等多个领域都表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: MaMe为各种SSM应用提供了一种有效的效率提升方法，解决了token减少在SSM中的关键挑战，建立了新的效率-性能权衡标准。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as powerful architectures in computer
vision, yet improving their computational efficiency remains crucial for
practical and scalable deployment.While token reduction serves as an effective
approach for model efficiency, applying it to SSMs requires careful
consideration of their unique sequential modeling capabilities.In this work, we
propose MaMe, a token-merging strategy tailored for SSM-based vision
models.MaMe addresses two key challenges: quantifying token importance and
preserving sequential properties. Our approach leverages the state transition
parameter $\mathbf{\Delta}$ as an informativeness measure and introduces
strategic token arrangements to preserve sequential information flow.Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MaMe achieves superior efficiency-performance
trade-offs for both fine-tuned and off-the-shelf models. Particularly, our
approach maintains robustness even under aggressive token reduction where
existing methods undergo significant performance degradation.Beyond image
classification, MaMe shows strong generalization capabilities across video and
audio domains, establishing an effective approach for enhancing efficiency in
diverse SSM applications.

TL;DR: 基于双重解耦设计的FoundationSSC框架，通过基础编码器提供语义和几何先验知识，使用专业化解耦路径精炼，并通过新的轴向融合模块实现特征融合，在两大数据集上创造了新的SOTA结果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有相机基于3D语义场景完成(SSC)方法依赖耦合编码器来传递语义和几何先验知识，这强刻模型在冲突需求之间做出折衷，限制了整体性能

Method: 提出FoundationSSC框架，在源头和路径层面进行双重解耦：源头层使用基础编码器提供丰富语义特征和高保真立体成本体积，路径层通过专业化解耦路径精炼这些先验知识，使用混合视图变换生成补充性3D特征，并通过新的轴向融合模块进行各异性融合

Result: 在SemanticKITTI数据集上超越之前最佳方法+0.23 mIoU和+2.03 IoU，在SSCBench-KITTI-360上达到状态前沿性能(21.78 mIoU和48.61 IoU)，实现了语义和几何指标的同时提升

Conclusion: 双重解耦设计有效解决了语义与几何先验知识的冲突问题，FoundationSSC框架通过分离和精炼的方式显著提升了相机基于3D语义场景完成的性能

Abstract: Camera-based 3D semantic scene completion (SSC) provides dense geometric and
semantic perception for autonomous driving and robotic navigation. However,
existing methods rely on a coupled encoder to deliver both semantic and
geometric priors, which forces the model to make a trade-off between
conflicting demands and limits its overall performance. To tackle these
challenges, we propose FoundationSSC, a novel framework that performs dual
decoupling at both the source and pathway levels. At the source level, we
introduce a foundation encoder that provides rich semantic feature priors for
the semantic branch and high-fidelity stereo cost volumes for the geometric
branch. At the pathway level, these priors are refined through specialised,
decoupled pathways, yielding superior semantic context and depth distributions.
Our dual-decoupling design produces disentangled and refined inputs, which are
then utilised by a hybrid view transformation to generate complementary 3D
features. Additionally, we introduce a novel Axis-Aware Fusion (AAF) module
that addresses the often-overlooked challenge of fusing these features by
anisotropically merging them into a unified representation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the advantages of FoundationSSC, achieving simultaneous
improvements in both semantic and geometric metrics, surpassing prior bests by
+0.23 mIoU and +2.03 IoU on SemanticKITTI. Additionally, we achieve
state-of-the-art performance on SSCBench-KITTI-360, with 21.78 mIoU and 48.61
IoU. The code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: With the growing demand for short videos and personalized content, automated
Video Log (Vlog) generation has become a key direction in multimodal content
creation. Existing methods mostly rely on predefined scripts, lacking dynamism
and personal expression. Therefore, there is an urgent need for an automated
Vlog generation approach that enables effective multimodal collaboration and
high personalization. To this end, we propose PersonaVlog, an automated
multimodal stylized Vlog generation framework that can produce personalized
Vlogs featuring videos, background music, and inner monologue speech based on a
given theme and reference image. Specifically, we propose a multi-agent
collaboration framework based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). This
framework efficiently generates high-quality prompts for multimodal content
creation based on user input, thereby improving the efficiency and creativity
of the process. In addition, we incorporate a feedback and rollback mechanism
that leverages MLLMs to evaluate and provide feedback on generated results,
thereby enabling iterative self-correction of multimodal content. We also
propose ThemeVlogEval, a theme-based automated benchmarking framework that
provides standardized metrics and datasets for fair evaluation. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate the significant advantages and potential of our
framework over several baselines, highlighting its effectiveness and great
potential for generating automated Vlogs.

Abstract: Face mask detection has become increasingly important recently, particularly
during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many face detection models have been developed in
smart entryways using IoT. However, there is a lack of IoT development on face
mask detection. This paper proposes a two-factor authentication system for
smart entryway access control using facial recognition and passcode
verification and an automation process to alert the owner and activate the
surveillance system when a stranger is detected and controls the system
remotely via Telegram on a Raspberry Pi platform. The system employs the Local
Binary Patterns Histograms for the full face recognition algorithm and modified
LBPH algorithm for occluded face detection. On average, the system achieved an
Accuracy of approximately 70%, a Precision of approximately 80%, and a Recall
of approximately 83.26% across all tested users. The results indicate that the
system is capable of conducting face recognition and mask detection, automating
the operation of the remote control to register users, locking or unlocking the
door, and notifying the owner. The sample participants highly accept it for
future use in the user acceptance test.

Motivation: 现有音频驱动说话头合成模型在种族、语言和年龄群体多样性方面存在泛化不足的问题，这主要是由于训练数据在规模、质量和多样性方面的局限性导致的。

Method: 通过多阶段自动化流水线精心筛选运动稳定性、美学质量和面部细节，构建了TalkVid数据集，并创建了TalkVid-Bench评估集，包含500个精心平衡的片段，覆盖关键人口统计和语言维度。

Result: 在TalkVid上训练的模型优于在先前数据集上训练的对应模型，展现出更好的跨数据集泛化能力。分析显示传统聚合指标掩盖了不同子组之间的性能差异。

Conclusion: TalkVid数据集和TalkVid-Bench评估集为解决说话头合成中的多样性泛化问题提供了重要资源，强调了在评估中考虑人口统计平衡的必要性。

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head synthesis has achieved remarkable photorealism, yet
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models exhibit a critical failure: they lack
generalization to the full spectrum of human diversity in ethnicity, language,
and age groups. We argue that this generalization gap is a direct symptom of
limitations in existing training data, which lack the necessary scale, quality,
and diversity. To address this challenge, we introduce TalkVid, a new
large-scale, high-quality, and diverse dataset containing 1244 hours of video
from 7729 unique speakers. TalkVid is curated through a principled, multi-stage
automated pipeline that rigorously filters for motion stability, aesthetic
quality, and facial detail, and is validated against human judgments to ensure
its reliability. Furthermore, we construct and release TalkVid-Bench, a
stratified evaluation set of 500 clips meticulously balanced across key
demographic and linguistic axes. Our experiments demonstrate that a model
trained on TalkVid outperforms counterparts trained on previous datasets,
exhibiting superior cross-dataset generalization. Crucially, our analysis on
TalkVid-Bench reveals performance disparities across subgroups that are
obscured by traditional aggregate metrics, underscoring its necessity for
future research. Code and data can be found in

Result: 在标准数据集上验证方法高效且精度超过以往RGB基础方法

Conclusion: 该方法为仅使用RGB图像进行类别级物体始位估计提供了新的视角，具有强大的应用潜力

Abstract: While most current RGB-D-based category-level object pose estimation methods
achieve strong performance, they face significant challenges in scenes lacking
depth information. In this paper, we propose a novel category-level object pose
estimation approach that relies solely on RGB images. This method enables
accurate pose estimation in real-world scenarios without the need for depth
data. Specifically, we design a transformer-based neural network for
category-level object pose estimation, where the transformer is employed to
predict and fuse the geometric features of the target object. To ensure that
these predicted geometric features faithfully capture the object's geometry, we
introduce a geometric feature-guided algorithm, which enhances the network's
ability to effectively represent the object's geometric information. Finally,
we utilize the RANSAC-PnP algorithm to compute the object's pose, addressing
the challenges associated with variable object scales in pose estimation.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach is not
only highly efficient but also achieves superior accuracy compared to previous
RGB-based methods. These promising results offer a new perspective for
advancing category-level object pose estimation using RGB images.

Motivation: 扩散模型在条件生成中对引导权重高度敏感，存在训练与推理阶段的不一致问题（训练-推理差距），这影响了生成样本的质量和稳定性。

Method: 提出DiffIER方法，这是一种基于优化的plug-and-play框架，在推理过程的每一步进行迭代误差最小化，有效减少累积误差。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在条件生成任务中优于基线方法，并在文本到图像生成、图像超分辨率和文本到语音生成等多个领域都取得了成功。

Conclusion: DiffIER方法通过优化推理过程中的误差，有效解决了训练-推理差距问题，具有广泛的适用性和应用潜力。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating
high-quality samples and enhancing performance across diverse domains through
Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG). However, the quality of generated samples is
highly sensitive to the selection of the guidance weight. In this work, we
identify a critical ``training-inference gap'' and we argue that it is the
presence of this gap that undermines the performance of conditional generation
and renders outputs highly sensitive to the guidance weight. We quantify this
gap by measuring the accumulated error during the inference stage and establish
a correlation between the selection of guidance weight and minimizing this gap.
Furthermore, to mitigate this gap, we propose DiffIER, an optimization-based
method for high-quality generation. We demonstrate that the accumulated error
can be effectively reduced by an iterative error minimization at each step
during inference. By introducing this novel plug-and-play optimization
framework, we enable the optimization of errors at every single inference step
and enhance generation quality. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed
method outperforms baseline approaches in conditional generation tasks.
Furthermore, the method achieves consistent success in text-to-image
generation, image super-resolution, and text-to-speech generation, underscoring
its versatility and potential for broad applications in future research.

Motivation: 现有的虚拟试穿方法主要关注服装，但实际应用中需要处理各种可穿戴物品。数据配对标定困难，需要开发能够处理多种物品类型的统一框架。

Method: 采用两阶段训练流程：第一阶段使用大规模无配对图像训练无掩码定位模型，利用修复模型在合适位置自动绘制物品；第二阶段使用少量配对图像微调，保持物品外观一致性。

Result: 在包含12类常见可穿戴物品的综合基准测试中，OmniTry在物品定位和ID保持方面均优于现有方法，且第一阶段训练后模型即使使用少量配对样本也能快速收敛。

Conclusion: OmniTry成功扩展了虚拟试穿的应用范围，能够处理各种可穿戴物品，提供了更实用的无掩码解决方案，并在多个类别上展现出优越性能。

Abstract: Virtual Try-ON (VTON) is a practical and widely-applied task, for which most
of existing works focus on clothes. This paper presents OmniTry, a unified
framework that extends VTON beyond garment to encompass any wearable objects,
e.g., jewelries and accessories, with mask-free setting for more practical
application. When extending to various types of objects, data curation is
challenging for obtaining paired images, i.e., the object image and the
corresponding try-on result. To tackle this problem, we propose a two-staged
pipeline: For the first stage, we leverage large-scale unpaired images, i.e.,
portraits with any wearable items, to train the model for mask-free
localization. Specifically, we repurpose the inpainting model to automatically
draw objects in suitable positions given an empty mask. For the second stage,
the model is further fine-tuned with paired images to transfer the consistency
of object appearance. We observed that the model after the first stage shows
quick convergence even with few paired samples. OmniTry is evaluated on a
comprehensive benchmark consisting of 12 common classes of wearable objects,
with both in-shop and in-the-wild images. Experimental results suggest that
OmniTry shows better performance on both object localization and
ID-preservation compared with existing methods. The code, model weights, and
evaluation benchmark of OmniTry will be made publicly available at

Conclusion: DeH4R模型通过混合设计有效解决了道路网络提取中的拓扑学保真度、空间一致性和计算效率的多重挑战，为远感图像路网提取领域提供了一种高效而准确的解决方案。

Abstract: The automated extraction of complete and precise road network graphs from
remote sensing imagery remains a critical challenge in geospatial computer
vision. Segmentation-based approaches, while effective in pixel-level
recognition, struggle to maintain topology fidelity after vectorization
postprocessing. Graph-growing methods build more topologically faithful graphs
but suffer from computationally prohibitive iterative ROI cropping.
Graph-generating methods first predict global static candidate road network
vertices, and then infer possible edges between vertices. They achieve fast
topology-aware inference, but limits the dynamic insertion of vertices. To
address these challenges, we propose DeH4R, a novel hybrid model that combines
graph-generating efficiency and graph-growing dynamics. This is achieved by
decoupling the task into candidate vertex detection, adjacent vertex
prediction, initial graph contruction, and graph expansion. This architectural
innovation enables dynamic vertex (edge) insertions while retaining fast
inference speed and enhancing both topology fidelity and spatial consistency.
Comprehensive evaluations on CityScale and SpaceNet benchmarks demonstrate
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. DeH4R outperforms the prior SOTA
graph-growing method RNGDet++ by 4.62 APLS and 10.18 IoU on CityScale, while
being approximately 10 $\times$ faster. The code will be made publicly
available at https://github.com/7777777FAN/DeH4R.

Abstract: The aspiration for artificial general intelligence, fueled by the rapid
progress of multimodal models, demands human-comparable performance across
diverse environments. We propose HumanPCR, an evaluation suite for probing
MLLMs' capacity about human-related visual contexts across three hierarchical
levels: Perception, Comprehension, and Reasoning (denoted by Human-P, Human-C,
and Human-R, respectively). Human-P and Human-C feature over 6,000
human-verified multiple choice questions, assessing massive tasks of 9
dimensions, including but not limited to essential skills frequently overlooked
by existing benchmarks. Human-R offers a challenging manually curated video
reasoning test that requires integrating multiple visual evidences, proactively
extracting context beyond question cues, and applying human-like expertise.
Each question includes human-annotated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales with
key visual evidence to support further research. Extensive evaluations on over
30 state-of-the-art models exhibit significant challenges in human-centric
visual understanding, particularly in tasks involving detailed space
perception, temporal understanding, and mind modeling. Moreover, analysis of
Human-R reveals the struggle of models in extracting essential proactive visual
evidence from diverse human scenes and their faulty reliance on query-guided
retrieval. Even with advanced techniques like scaling visual contexts and
test-time thinking yield only limited benefits. We hope HumanPCR and our
findings will advance the development, evaluation, and human-centric
application of multimodal models.

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality annotated data for medical image segmentation is
tedious and costly. Semi-supervised segmentation techniques alleviate this
burden by leveraging unlabeled data to generate pseudo labels. Recently,
advanced state space models, represented by Mamba, have shown efficient
handling of long-range dependencies. This drives us to explore their potential
in semi-supervised medical image segmentation. In this paper, we propose a
novel Diversity-enhanced Collaborative Mamba framework (namely DCMamba) for
semi-supervised medical image segmentation, which explores and utilizes the
diversity from data, network, and feature perspectives. Firstly, from the data
perspective, we develop patch-level weak-strong mixing augmentation with
Mamba's scanning modeling characteristics. Moreover, from the network
perspective, we introduce a diverse-scan collaboration module, which could
benefit from the prediction discrepancies arising from different scanning
directions. Furthermore, from the feature perspective, we adopt an
uncertainty-weighted contrastive learning mechanism to enhance the diversity of
feature representation. Experiments demonstrate that our DCMamba significantly
outperforms other semi-supervised medical image segmentation methods, e.g.,
yielding the latest SSM-based method by 6.69% on the Synapse dataset with 20%
labeled data.

Abstract: Every day, a large amount of educational content is uploaded online across
different areas, including agriculture and gardening. When these videos or
materials are grouped meaningfully, they can make learning easier and more
effective. One promising way to organize and enrich such content is through the
Metaverse, which allows users to explore educational experiences in an
interactive and immersive environment. However, searching for relevant
Metaverse scenarios and finding those matching users' interests remains a
challenging task. A first step in this direction has been done recently, but
existing datasets are small and not sufficient for training advanced models. In
this work, we make two main contributions: first, we introduce a new dataset
containing 457 agricultural-themed virtual museums (AgriMuseums), each enriched
with textual descriptions; and second, we propose a hierarchical
vision-language model to represent and retrieve relevant AgriMuseums using
natural language queries. In our experimental setting, the proposed method
achieves up to about 62\% R@1 and 78\% MRR, confirming its effectiveness, and
it also leads to improvements on existing benchmarks by up to 6\% R@1 and 11\%
MRR. Moreover, an extensive evaluation validates our design choices. Code and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法将丰富的视觉语义压缩为单一全局向量，限制了攻击的细粒度控制能力，且忽视了投影器模块在视觉-语言对齐中的关键作用。

Method: 提出Intermediate Projector Guided Attack (IPGA)，利用Q-Former投影器模块的中间阶段进行攻击，并引入Residual Query Alignment (RQA)来保留无关视觉内容。

Result: 在标准全局图像描述任务和细粒度视觉问答任务中均优于现有方法，并能成功迁移到多个商业VLM（如Google Gemini和OpenAI GPT）。

Conclusion: IPGA通过操作语义上有意义的视觉标记而非单一全局表示，实现了更精确的对抗扰动控制，显著提升了攻击效果和跨模型可迁移性。

Abstract: Targeted adversarial attacks are essential for proactively identifying
security flaws in Vision-Language Models before real-world deployment. However,
current methods perturb images to maximize global similarity with the target
text or reference image at the encoder level, collapsing rich visual semantics
into a single global vector. This limits attack granularity, hindering
fine-grained manipulations such as modifying a car while preserving its
background. Furthermore, these methods largely overlook the projector module, a
critical semantic bridge between the visual encoder and the language model in
VLMs, thereby failing to disrupt the full vision-language alignment pipeline
within VLMs and limiting attack effectiveness. To address these issues, we
propose the Intermediate Projector Guided Attack (IPGA), the first method to
attack using the intermediate stage of the projector module, specifically the
widely adopted Q-Former, which transforms global image embeddings into
fine-grained visual features. This enables more precise control over
adversarial perturbations by operating on semantically meaningful visual tokens
rather than a single global representation. Specifically, IPGA leverages the
Q-Former pretrained solely on the first vision-language alignment stage,
without LLM fine-tuning, which improves both attack effectiveness and
transferability across diverse VLMs. Furthermore, we propose Residual Query
Alignment (RQA) to preserve unrelated visual content, thereby yielding more
controlled and precise adversarial manipulations. Extensive experiments show
that our attack method consistently outperforms existing methods in both
standard global image captioning tasks and fine-grained visual
question-answering tasks in black-box environment. Additionally, IPGA
successfully transfers to multiple commercial VLMs, including Google Gemini and
OpenAI GPT.

TL;DR: FOCUS是一种无需训练的解码策略，通过顺序掩码图像来缓解多图像输入时的信息泄露问题，显著提升多图像推理性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在单图像任务上表现良好，但在处理多图像输入时性能显著下降，因为不同图像的视觉线索在模型输出中相互干扰，出现跨图像信息泄露现象

Method: 提出FOCUS解码策略：顺序用随机噪声掩码除一张图像外的所有图像，引导模型专注于单张干净图像；重复此过程获取部分掩码上下文下的logits，然后聚合并通过噪声参考输入进行对比精炼

Result: FOCUS在四个多图像基准测试和多种LVLM模型家族中一致提升性能

Conclusion: FOCUS提供了一种通用实用的解决方案，无需额外训练或架构修改即可增强多图像推理能力

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong performance on
single-image tasks. However, we observe that their performance degrades
significantly when handling multi-image inputs. This occurs because visual cues
from different images become entangled in the model's output. We refer to this
phenomenon as cross-image information leakage. To address this issue, we
propose FOCUS, a training-free and architecture-agnostic decoding strategy that
mitigates cross-image information leakage during inference. FOCUS sequentially
masks all but one image with random noise, guiding the model to focus on the
single clean image. We repeat this process across all target images to obtain
logits under partially masked contexts. These logits are aggregated and then
contrastively refined using a noise-only reference input, which suppresses the
leakage and yields more accurate outputs. FOCUS consistently improves
performance across four multi-image benchmarks and diverse LVLM families. This
demonstrates that FOCUS offers a general and practical solution for enhancing
multi-image reasoning without additional training or architectural
modifications.

TL;DR: MR6D是一个专为移动机器人6D姿态估计设计的工业环境数据集，解决了现有数据集局限于家庭小物件的问题，包含92个真实场景、16个独特物体，涵盖静态和动态交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有6D姿态估计数据集主要关注机械臂操作的小型家庭物品，无法满足移动机器人平台的需求。移动机器人需要处理更大物体、远距离感知、严重自遮挡和多样化视角等挑战。

Method: 创建MR6D数据集，包含92个真实工业场景和16个独特物体，涵盖静态和动态交互场景，特别捕捉移动平台特有的挑战：远距离视角、多样化物体配置、大尺寸物体和复杂遮挡模式。

Result: 初步实验显示当前6D姿态估计流程在这些设置下表现不佳，2D分割成为另一个障碍。数据集为移动机器人姿态估计方法的开发和评估奠定了基础。

Conclusion: MR6D填补了移动机器人6D姿态估计领域的空白，为开发适应移动机器人需求的姿态估计方法提供了重要的数据集基础，数据集已公开可用。

Abstract: Existing 6D pose estimation datasets primarily focus on small household
objects typically handled by robot arm manipulators, limiting their relevance
to mobile robotics. Mobile platforms often operate without manipulators,
interact with larger objects, and face challenges such as long-range
perception, heavy self-occlusion, and diverse camera perspectives. While recent
models generalize well to unseen objects, evaluations remain confined to
household-like settings that overlook these factors. We introduce MR6D, a
dataset designed for 6D pose estimation for mobile robots in industrial
environments. It includes 92 real-world scenes featuring 16 unique objects
across static and dynamic interactions. MR6D captures the challenges specific
to mobile platforms, including distant viewpoints, varied object
configurations, larger object sizes, and complex occlusion/self-occlusion
patterns. Initial experiments reveal that current 6D pipelines underperform in
these settings, with 2D segmentation being another hurdle. MR6D establishes a
foundation for developing and evaluating pose estimation methods tailored to
the demands of mobile robotics. The dataset is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的单图像Shape-from-Template方法存在局限，多相机联合信息能够扩展3D形状配准的应用范围，如医学成像和手持相机场景，提高重建精度

Method: 使用广义相机模型表示多相机设置，提出三种方法：1)已知3D点的方向向量对应点；2)未知3D点但已知局部参考系方向的对应点；3)包含轮廓信息的对应点。前两种用凸规划求解，第三种迭代优化凸解结果

Result: 在大量合成和真实数据上验证了所提方法的准确性，展示了多视角约束信息对变形形状估计的改进效果

Conclusion: 这是首个解决广义相机SfT问题的方法集，通过多视角互约束信息显著提高了非刚性3D形状配准的精度和鲁棒性

Abstract: This article presents a new method for non-rigidly registering a 3D shape to
2D keypoints observed by a constellation of multiple cameras. Non-rigid
registration of a 3D shape to observed 2D keypoints, i.e., Shape-from-Template
(SfT), has been widely studied using single images, but SfT with information
from multiple-cameras jointly opens new directions for extending the scope of
known use-cases such as 3D shape registration in medical imaging and
registration from hand-held cameras, to name a few. We represent such
multi-camera setup with the generalised camera model; therefore any collection
of perspective or orthographic cameras observing any deforming object can be
registered. We propose multiple approaches for such SfT: the first approach
where the corresponded keypoints lie on a direction vector from a known 3D
point in space, the second approach where the corresponded keypoints lie on a
direction vector from an unknown 3D point in space but with known orientation
w.r.t some local reference frame, and a third approach where, apart from
correspondences, the silhouette of the imaged object is also known. Together,
these form the first set of solutions to the SfT problem with generalised
cameras. The key idea behind SfT with generalised camera is the improved
reconstruction accuracy from estimating deformed shape while utilising the
additional information from the mutual constraints between multiple views of a
deformed object. The correspondence-based approaches are solved with convex
programming while the silhouette-based approach is an iterative refinement of
the results from the convex solutions. We demonstrate the accuracy of our
proposed methods on many synthetic and real data

*Jiajing Lin,Shu Jiang,Qingyuan Zeng,Zhenzhong Wang,Min Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisionLaw是一个双层优化框架，通过LLM驱动的解耦本构演化策略和视觉引导的本构评估机制，从视觉观察中推断可解释的内在动力学表达式，解决了现有方法泛化性差和可解释性有限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法推断物体内在动力学时面临两大挑战：基于手动定义本构先验的方法难以泛化到复杂场景，而基于神经网络的方法可解释性差且泛化能力有限。需要一种能够从视觉观察中推断可解释内在动力学表达式的方法。

Method: 提出双层优化框架：上层使用LLM作为物理专家生成和修订本构定律，通过解耦机制降低搜索复杂度；下层通过视觉模拟评估生成的本构定律与底层内在动力学的一致性，指导上层演化。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，VisionLaw能够有效从视觉观察中推断可解释的内在动力学，显著优于现有最先进方法，并在新场景的交互模拟中表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: VisionLaw框架成功解决了内在动力学推断中的泛化性和可解释性问题，通过结合LLM的物理知识和视觉模拟验证，实现了从视觉观察到可解释物理定律的有效推断。

Abstract: The intrinsic dynamics of an object governs its physical behavior in the real
world, playing a critical role in enabling physically plausible interactive
simulation with 3D assets. Existing methods have attempted to infer the
intrinsic dynamics of objects from visual observations, but generally face two
major challenges: one line of work relies on manually defined constitutive
priors, making it difficult to generalize to complex scenarios; the other
models intrinsic dynamics using neural networks, resulting in limited
interpretability and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we
propose VisionLaw, a bilevel optimization framework that infers interpretable
expressions of intrinsic dynamics from visual observations. At the upper level,
we introduce an LLMs-driven decoupled constitutive evolution strategy, where
LLMs are prompted as a knowledgeable physics expert to generate and revise
constitutive laws, with a built-in decoupling mechanism that substantially
reduces the search complexity of LLMs. At the lower level, we introduce a
vision-guided constitutive evaluation mechanism, which utilizes visual
simulation to evaluate the consistency between the generated constitutive law
and the underlying intrinsic dynamics, thereby guiding the upper-level
evolution. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that VisionLaw can effectively infer interpretable intrinsic dynamics from
visual observations. It significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods and exhibits strong generalization for interactive simulation in novel
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高乳腺癌超声分割的准确性和可解释性，通过整合临床文本信息来增强模型的可信度和透明度，为计算机辅助诊断提供更可靠的解决方案。

Method: 使用双分支视觉编码器（ViT和Swin Transformer）结合不确定性感知融合，通过BioClinicalBERT编码BI-RADS语义的临床语言，利用跨模态注意力融合视觉和文本特征，同时生成分割掩码、不确定性图和诊断依据。

Result: 在BUS-BRA数据集上达到99% Dice分数和95% IoU，优于U-Net、ViT和Swin基线模型；多模态对齐CLIP分数85%，置信度校准ECE为3.2%；消融研究显示临床文本对分割精度和解释质量至关重要。

Conclusion: Med-CTX通过整合临床文本信息显著提升了乳腺癌超声分割的性能和可解释性，为可信赖的多模态医疗架构设立了新标准，在计算机辅助诊断中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: We introduce Med-CTX, a fully transformer based multimodal framework for
explainable breast cancer ultrasound segmentation. We integrate clinical
radiology reports to boost both performance and interpretability. Med-CTX
achieves exact lesion delineation by using a dual-branch visual encoder that
combines ViT and Swin transformers, as well as uncertainty aware fusion.
Clinical language structured with BI-RADS semantics is encoded by
BioClinicalBERT and combined with visual features utilising cross-modal
attention, allowing the model to provide clinically grounded, model generated
explanations. Our methodology generates segmentation masks, uncertainty maps,
and diagnostic rationales all at once, increasing confidence and transparency
in computer assisted diagnosis. On the BUS-BRA dataset, Med-CTX achieves a Dice
score of 99% and an IoU of 95%, beating existing baselines U-Net, ViT, and
Swin. Clinical text plays a key role in segmentation accuracy and explanation
quality, as evidenced by ablation studies that show a -5.4% decline in Dice
score and -31% in CIDEr. Med-CTX achieves good multimodal alignment (CLIP
score: 85%) and increased confi dence calibration (ECE: 3.2%), setting a new
bar for trustworthy, multimodal medical architecture.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种时间步压缩攻击(TCA)框架，通过时间步级反向传播和对抗膜电位重用技术，在保持攻击成功率的同时显著减少了攻击延迟，解决了现有SNN攻击方法的实时性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于梯度的SNN对抗攻击方法存在显著的攻击延迟问题，这主要是因为它们直接扩展自ANN框架，没有充分利用SNN的特性，导致多时间步处理耗时过长，不适用于实际实时应用。

Method: 提出时间步压缩攻击(TCA)框架，包含两个核心组件：1)时间步级反向传播(TLBP)，基于发现生成干扰的全局时间信息并非关键，支持按时间步评估以实现早期停止；2)对抗膜电位重用(A-MPR)，利用初始时间步为膜电位累积热身阶段的观察，实现预计算和重用。

Result: 在VGG-11和ResNet-17模型上使用CIFAR-10/100和CIFAR10-DVS数据集进行实验，TCA在白盒和黑盒设置下分别减少了围绝56.6%和57.1%的攻击延迟，同时保持了相当的攻击成功率。

Conclusion: TCA框架通过充分利用SNN的特有性质，有效解决了现有攻击方法的实时性限制，为SNN在实际应用中的安全部署提供了更高效的对抗攻击方案。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) gradient-based adversarial attacks on spiking neural
networks (SNNs), which largely rely on extending FGSM and PGD frameworks, face
a critical limitation: substantial attack latency from multi-timestep
processing, rendering them infeasible for practical real-time applications.
This inefficiency stems from their design as direct extensions of ANN
paradigms, which fail to exploit key SNN properties. In this paper, we propose
the timestep-compressed attack (TCA), a novel framework that significantly
reduces attack latency. TCA introduces two components founded on key insights
into SNN behavior. First, timestep-level backpropagation (TLBP) is based on our
finding that global temporal information in backpropagation to generate
perturbations is not critical for an attack's success, enabling per-timestep
evaluation for early stopping. Second, adversarial membrane potential reuse
(A-MPR) is motivated by the observation that initial timesteps are
inefficiently spent accumulating membrane potential, a warm-up phase that can
be pre-calculated and reused. Our experiments on VGG-11 and ResNet-17 with the
CIFAR-10/100 and CIFAR10-DVS datasets show that TCA significantly reduces the
required attack latency by up to 56.6% and 57.1% compared to SOTA methods in
white-box and black-box settings, respectively, while maintaining a comparable
attack success rate.

Motivation: 城市树木生物多样性对气候遭弹性和生态稳定至关重要，但现有量付方法成本高、耗时，而监督AI方法需要标签数据且跨区域沿用性差。

Method: 提出无监督聚类框架，整合街道层级图像的视觉嵌入和空间植装模式，在无标签情况下估算生物多样性。

Result: 在8个北美城市应用，方法能高保真度恢复属级多样性模式，Shannon和Simpson指数的Wasserstein距离低，保持了空间自相关性。

Conclusion: 该可缩放、细粒度方法能够为缺乏详细资产清内的城市制作生物多样性地图，支持连续、低成本监测，促进绿化许可公平和城市生态系统的适应性管理。

Abstract: Urban tree biodiversity is critical for climate resilience, ecological
stability, and livability in cities, yet most municipalities lack detailed
knowledge of their canopies. Field-based inventories provide reliable estimates
of Shannon and Simpson diversity but are costly and time-consuming, while
supervised AI methods require labeled data that often fail to generalize across
regions. We introduce an unsupervised clustering framework that integrates
visual embeddings from street-level imagery with spatial planting patterns to
estimate biodiversity without labels. Applied to eight North American cities,
the method recovers genus-level diversity patterns with high fidelity,
achieving low Wasserstein distances to ground truth for Shannon and Simpson
indices and preserving spatial autocorrelation. This scalable, fine-grained
approach enables biodiversity mapping in cities lacking detailed inventories
and offers a pathway for continuous, low-cost monitoring to support equitable
access to greenery and adaptive management of urban ecosystems.

Abstract: Achieving top-notch performance in Intelligent Transportation detection is a
critical research area. However, many challenges still need to be addressed
when it comes to detecting in a cross-domain scenario. In this paper, we
propose a Self-Aware Adaptive Alignment (SA3), by leveraging an efficient
alignment mechanism and recognition strategy. Our proposed method employs a
specified attention-based alignment module trained on source and target domain
datasets to guide the image-level features alignment process, enabling the
local-global adaptive alignment between the source domain and target domain.
Features from both domains, whose channel importance is re-weighted, are fed
into the region proposal network, which facilitates the acquisition of salient
region features. Also, we introduce an instance-to-image level alignment module
specific to the target domain to adaptively mitigate the domain gap. To
evaluate the proposed method, extensive experiments have been conducted on
popular cross-domain object detection benchmarks. Experimental results show
that SA3 achieves superior results to the previous state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 当前的文本到图像模型在视觉效果上表现优异，但常常无法精确对齐文本提示，导致缺失关键元素或不应该混合的概念

Method: 学习高成功率分布，显式建模去噪过程中的信号组件，提供细粒度控制，无需训练且兼容现有扩散和流匹配架构，支持边框等额外条件

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models produce visually impressive results but
often struggle with precise alignment to text prompts, leading to missing
critical elements or unintended blending of distinct concepts. We propose a
novel approach that learns a high-success-rate distribution conditioned on a
target prompt, ensuring that generated images faithfully reflect the
corresponding prompts. Our method explicitly models the signal component during
the denoising process, offering fine-grained control that mitigates
over-optimization and out-of-distribution artifacts. Moreover, our framework is
training-free and seamlessly integrates with both existing diffusion and flow
matching architectures. It also supports additional conditioning modalities --
such as bounding boxes -- for enhanced spatial alignment. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. The

Motivation: 现有增量学习评估多使用合成的简化基准，影响了对现实世界性能的准确评估。需要更现实的评测方案来更好地理解增量学习方法在复杂实际场景下的表现问题。

Method: 提出了两个现实性增量学习目标检测基准(RICO)：领域RICO(D-RICO)和扩展类别RICO(EC-RICO)。基于14个多样化数据集构建，涵盖真实和合成领域、多种条件(天气、时间)、相机传感器、视角和标注策略等实际挑战。

Result: 实验显示所有增量学习方法在适应性和知识保持方面都表现不佳，而简单地重放少量历史数据已经能够超过所有方法。但是，依然比不上在所有数据上进行单独训练的效果。

Conclusion: 当前增量学习方法在现实场景下仍然面临重大挑战，应该重新关注识别软件的弱点、单一模型的任务管理能力不足以及可塑性不足等根本问题。

Abstract: Incremental Learning (IL) trains models sequentially on new data without full
retraining, offering privacy, efficiency, and scalability. IL must balance
adaptability to new data with retention of old knowledge. However, evaluations
often rely on synthetic, simplified benchmarks, obscuring real-world IL
performance. To address this, we introduce two Realistic Incremental Object
Detection Benchmarks (RICO): Domain RICO (D-RICO) features domain shifts with a
fixed class set, and Expanding-Classes RICO (EC-RICO) integrates new domains
and classes per IL step. Built from 14 diverse datasets covering real and
synthetic domains, varying conditions (e.g., weather, time of day), camera
sensors, perspectives, and labeling policies, both benchmarks capture
challenges absent in existing evaluations. Our experiments show that all IL
methods underperform in adaptability and retention, while replaying a small
amount of previous data already outperforms all methods. However, individual
training on the data remains superior. We heuristically attribute this gap to
weak teachers in distillation, single models' inability to manage diverse
tasks, and insufficient plasticity. Our code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Deep learning models in medical imaging often achieve strong in-distribution
performance but struggle to generalise under distribution shifts, frequently
relying on spurious correlations instead of clinically meaningful features. We
introduce LCRReg, a novel regularisation approach that leverages Latent Concept
Representations (LCRs) (e.g., Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs)) to guide
models toward semantically grounded representations. LCRReg requires no concept
labels in the main training set and instead uses a small auxiliary dataset to
synthesise high-quality, disentangled concept examples. We extract LCRs for
predefined relevant features, and incorporate a regularisation term that guides
a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to activate within latent subspaces
associated with those concepts. We evaluate LCRReg across synthetic and
real-world medical tasks. On a controlled toy dataset, it significantly
improves robustness to injected spurious correlations and remains effective
even in multi-concept and multiclass settings. On the diabetic retinopathy
binary classification task, LCRReg enhances performance under both synthetic
spurious perturbations and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation. Compared
to baselines, including multitask learning, linear probing, and post-hoc
concept-based models, LCRReg offers a lightweight, architecture-agnostic
strategy for improving model robustness without requiring dense concept
supervision. Code is available at the following link:

Abstract: The South Asian Smog refers to the recurring annual air pollution events
marked by high contaminant levels, reduced visibility, and significant
socio-economic impacts, primarily affecting the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) from
November to February. Over the past decade, increased air pollution sources
such as crop residue burning, motor vehicles, and changing weather patterns
have intensified these smog events. However, real-time forecasting systems for
increased particulate matter concentrations are still not established at
regional scale. The Aerosol Index, closely tied to smog formation and a key
component in calculating the Air Quality Index (AQI), reflects particulate
matter concentrations. This study forecasts aerosol events using Sentinel-5P
air constituent data (2019-2023) and a Convolutional Long-Short Term Memory
(ConvLSTM) neural network, which captures spatial and temporal correlations
more effectively than previous models. Using the Ultraviolet (UV) Aerosol Index
at 340-380 nm as the predictor, results show the Aerosol Index can be
forecasted at five-day intervals with a Mean Squared Error of ~0.0018, loss of
~0.3995, and Structural Similarity Index of ~0.74. While effective, the model
can be improved by integrating additional data and refining its architecture.

Abstract: Medical ultrasound image segmentation presents a formidable challenge in the
realm of computer vision. Traditional approaches rely on Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based methods to address the intricacies of
medical image segmentation. Nevertheless, inherent limitations persist, as
CNN-based methods tend to disregard long-range dependencies, while
Transformer-based methods may overlook local contextual information. To address
these deficiencies, we propose a novel Feature Aggregation Module (FAM)
designed to process two input features from the preceding layer. These features
are seamlessly directed into two branches of the Convolution and
Cross-Attention Parallel Module (CCAPM) to endow them with different roles in
each of the two branches to help establish a strong connection between the two
input features. This strategy enables our module to focus concurrently on both
long-range dependencies and local contextual information by judiciously merging
convolution operations with cross-attention mechanisms. Moreover, by
integrating FAM within our proposed Spatial-Channel Regulation Module (SCRM),
the ability to discern salient regions and informative features warranting
increased attention is enhanced. Furthermore, by incorporating the SCRM into
the encoder block of the UNet architecture, we introduce a novel framework
dubbed Spatial-Channel Regulation Network (SCRNet). The results of our
extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of SCRNet, which consistently
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: While physics-grounded 3D motion synthesis has seen significant progress,
current methods face critical limitations. They typically rely on
pre-reconstructed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representations, while physics
integration depends on either inflexible, manually defined physical attributes
or unstable, optimization-heavy guidance from video models. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce PhysGM, a feed-forward framework that jointly predicts
a 3D Gaussian representation and its physical properties from a single image,
enabling immediate, physical simulation and high-fidelity 4D rendering. We
first establish a base model by jointly optimizing for Gaussian reconstruction
and probabilistic physics prediction. The model is then refined with physically
plausible reference videos to enhance both rendering fidelity and physics
prediction accuracy. We adopt the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align
its simulations with reference videos, circumventing Score Distillation
Sampling (SDS) optimization which needs back-propagating gradients through the
complex differentiable simulation and rasterization. To facilitate the
training, we introduce a new dataset PhysAssets of over 24,000 3D assets,
annotated with physical properties and corresponding guiding videos.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively generates
high-fidelity 4D simulations from a single image in one minute. This represents
a significant speedup over prior works while delivering realistic rendering
results. Our project page is at:https://hihixiaolv.github.io/PhysGM.github.io/

Motivation: 现实环境中复杂光照条件（如低光和背光）导致的图像退化严重影响图像质量和下游视觉任务，现有方法大多只能处理单一类型的光照退化，缺乏统一处理多种光照条件的能力

Method: 提出混合专家光照估计模块，使用稀疏门控机制自适应选择S曲线专家网络；设计损伤恢复模块，配备光照感知交叉注意力和序列状态全局注意力机制；构建混合光照数据集MixBL进行训练

Result: 实验结果表明DIME-Net在合成和真实世界的低光和背光数据集上均取得竞争性性能，无需任何重新训练

Conclusion: 该方法展示了在多样复杂光照条件下的泛化能力和实际多媒体应用潜力

Abstract: Image degradation caused by complex lighting conditions such as low-light and
backlit scenarios is commonly encountered in real-world environments,
significantly affecting image quality and downstream vision tasks. Most
existing methods focus on a single type of illumination degradation and lack
the ability to handle diverse lighting conditions in a unified manner. To
address this issue, we propose a dual-illumination enhancement framework called
DIME-Net. The core of our method is a Mixture-of-Experts illumination estimator
module, where a sparse gating mechanism adaptively selects suitable S-curve
expert networks based on the illumination characteristics of the input image.
By integrating Retinex theory, this module effectively performs enhancement
tailored to both low-light and backlit images. To further correct
illumination-induced artifacts and color distortions, we design a damage
restoration module equipped with Illumination-Aware Cross Attention and
Sequential-State Global Attention mechanisms. In addition, we construct a
hybrid illumination dataset, MixBL, by integrating existing datasets, allowing
our model to achieve robust illumination adaptability through a single training
process. Experimental results show that DIME-Net achieves competitive
performance on both synthetic and real-world low-light and backlit datasets
without any retraining. These results demonstrate its generalization ability
and potential for practical multimedia applications under diverse and complex
illumination conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的人脸图像质量评估方法主要依赖卷积神经网络，而Vision Transformer架构的潜力尚未被充分探索，需要开发基于ViT的高效FIQA方法。

Method: 扩展标准ViT骨干网络，添加可学习的质量token与图像patch token拼接，通过全局自注意力聚合上下文信息，使用双分支结构分别处理人脸表示和质量预测。

Result: 在多个具有挑战性的基准测试和不同FR模型上，ViT-FIQA始终达到顶级性能，证明了基于transformer架构在建模人脸图像效用方面的有效性。

Conclusion: ViT-FIQA展示了Vision Transformer作为可扩展基础在未来FIQA研究中的潜力，为基于transformer的人脸质量评估方法开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Face Image Quality Assessment (FIQA) aims to predict the utility of a face
image for face recognition (FR) systems. State-of-the-art FIQA methods mainly
rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), leaving the potential of Vision
Transformer (ViT) architectures underexplored. This work proposes ViT-FIQA, a
novel approach that extends standard ViT backbones, originally optimized for
FR, through a learnable quality token designed to predict a scalar utility
score for any given face image. The learnable quality token is concatenated
with the standard image patch tokens, and the whole sequence is processed via
global self-attention by the ViT encoders to aggregate contextual information
across all patches. At the output of the backbone, ViT-FIQA branches into two
heads: (1) the patch tokens are passed through a fully connected layer to learn
discriminative face representations via a margin-penalty softmax loss, and (2)
the quality token is fed into a regression head to learn to predict the face
sample's utility. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks and several
FR models, including both CNN- and ViT-based architectures, demonstrate that
ViT-FIQA consistently achieves top-tier performance. These results underscore
the effectiveness of transformer-based architectures in modeling face image
utility and highlight the potential of ViTs as a scalable foundation for future
FIQA research https://cutt.ly/irHlzXUC.

*Tianyi Niu,Jaemin Cho,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Mohit Bansal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 多模态大语言模型在识别图像旋转角度方面表现不佳，特别是无法可靠区分90度和270度旋转，显示出与人类空间感知能力的显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多模态大语言模型在图像旋转识别任务中的能力，评估其空间推理和视觉理解能力，因为这项任务需要检测旋转线索并在不同方向下理解空间关系。

Method: 引入RotBench基准测试（350张手动筛选的图像），测试多个先进MLLM模型（包括GPT-5、o3、Gemini-2.5-Pro等），使用辅助信息（标题、深度图等）和思维链提示，并进行微调实验。

Result: 大多数模型能可靠识别正立（0度）图像，部分能识别倒立（180度）图像，但都无法可靠区分90度和270度旋转。辅助信息和思维链提示只有微小改善，微调也无法改善90/270度区分能力。

Conclusion: MLLM在空间推理能力方面存在显著缺陷，特别是在区分镜像旋转角度时，与人类感知能力存在明显差距，需要进一步改进模型的空间理解能力。

Abstract: We investigate to what extent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can
accurately identify the orientation of input images rotated 0{\deg}, 90{\deg},
180{\deg}, and 270{\deg}. This task demands robust visual reasoning
capabilities to detect rotational cues and contextualize spatial relationships
within images, regardless of their orientation. To evaluate MLLMs on these
abilities, we introduce RotBench -- a 350-image manually-filtered benchmark
comprising lifestyle, portrait, and landscape images. Despite the relatively
simple nature of this task, we show that several state-of-the-art open and
proprietary MLLMs, including GPT-5, o3, and Gemini-2.5-Pro, do not reliably
identify rotation in input images. Providing models with auxiliary information
-- including captions, depth maps, and more -- or using chain-of-thought
prompting offers only small and inconsistent improvements. Our results indicate
that most models are able to reliably identify right-side-up (0{\deg}) images,
while certain models are able to identify upside-down (180{\deg}) images. None
can reliably distinguish between 90{\deg} and 270{\deg}. Simultaneously showing
the image rotated in different orientations leads to moderate performance gains
for reasoning models, while a modified setup using voting improves the
performance of weaker models. We further show that fine-tuning does not improve
models' ability to distinguish 90{\deg} and 270{\deg} rotations, despite
substantially improving the identification of 180{\deg} images. Together, these
results reveal a significant gap between MLLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities
and human perception in identifying rotation.

Abstract: Depth estimation is a fundamental task for 3D scene understanding in
autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. Existing depth datasets,
such as KITTI, nuScenes, and DDAD, have advanced the field but suffer from
limitations in diversity and scalability. As benchmark performance on these
datasets approaches saturation, there is an increasing need for a new
generation of large-scale, diverse, and cost-efficient datasets to support the
era of foundation models and multi-modal learning. To address these challenges,
we introduce a large-scale, diverse, frame-wise continuous dataset for depth
estimation in dynamic outdoor driving environments, comprising 20K video frames
to evaluate existing methods. Our lightweight acquisition pipeline ensures
broad scene coverage at low cost, while sparse yet statistically sufficient
ground truth enables robust training. Compared to existing datasets, ours
presents greater diversity in driving scenarios and lower depth density,
creating new challenges for generalization. Benchmark experiments with standard
monocular depth estimation models validate the dataset's utility and highlight
substantial performance gaps in challenging conditions, establishing a new
platform for advancing depth estimation research.

Conclusion: 通过主动学习策略优化注释类型选择，结3D超像素技术生成伪标签，可以在减少视频动作检测注释成本的同时维持良好的检测性能。

Abstract: Video action detection requires dense spatio-temporal annotations, which are
both challenging and expensive to obtain. However, real-world videos often vary
in difficulty and may not require the same level of annotation. This paper
analyzes the appropriate annotation types for each sample and their impact on
spatio-temporal video action detection. It focuses on two key aspects: 1) how
to obtain varying levels of annotation for videos, and 2) how to learn action
detection from different annotation types. The study explores video-level tags,
points, scribbles, bounding boxes, and pixel-level masks. First, a simple
active learning strategy is proposed to estimate the necessary annotation type
for each video. Then, a novel spatio-temporal 3D-superpixel approach is
introduced to generate pseudo-labels from these annotations, enabling effective
training. The approach is validated on UCF101-24 and JHMDB-21 datasets,
significantly cutting annotation costs with minimal performance loss.

Abstract: The design and analysis of pallet setups are essential for ensuring safety of
packages transportation. With rising demands in the logistics sector, the
development of automated systems utilizing advanced technologies has become

Abstract: Outside of urban hubs, autonomous cars and trucks have to master driving on
intercity highways. Safe, long-distance highway travel at speeds exceeding 100
km/h demands perception distances of at least 250 m, which is about five times
the 50-100m typically addressed in city driving, to allow sufficient planning
and braking margins. Increasing the perception ranges also allows to extend
autonomy from light two-ton passenger vehicles to large-scale forty-ton trucks,
which need a longer planning horizon due to their high inertia. However, most
existing perception approaches focus on shorter ranges and rely on Bird's Eye
View (BEV) representations, which incur quadratic increases in memory and
compute costs as distance grows. To overcome this limitation, we built on top
of a sparse representation and introduced an efficient 3D encoding of
multi-modal and temporal features, along with a novel self-supervised
pre-training scheme that enables large-scale learning from unlabeled
camera-LiDAR data. Our approach extends perception distances to 250 meters and
achieves an 26.6% improvement in mAP in object detection and a decrease of
30.5% in Chamfer Distance in LiDAR forecasting compared to existing methods,
reaching distances up to 250 meters. Project Page:

Conclusion: 通过智能选择非关键帧来补充场景覆盖，该方法能够在在线限制下生成更完整高质量的3DGS模型

Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of generating online 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) models from RGB-only frames. Previous studies have employed dense SLAM
techniques to estimate 3D scenes from keyframes for 3DGS model construction.
However, these methods are limited by their reliance solely on keyframes, which
are insufficient to capture an entire scene, resulting in incomplete
reconstructions. Moreover, building a generalizable model requires
incorporating frames from diverse viewpoints to achieve broader scene coverage.
However, online processing restricts the use of many frames or extensive
training iterations. Therefore, we propose a novel method for high-quality 3DGS
modeling that improves model completeness through adaptive view selection. By
analyzing reconstruction quality online, our approach selects optimal
non-keyframes for additional training. By integrating both keyframes and
selected non-keyframes, the method refines incomplete regions from diverse
viewpoints, significantly enhancing completeness. We also present a framework
that incorporates an online multi-view stereo approach, ensuring consistency in
3D information throughout the 3DGS modeling process. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, delivering
exceptional performance in complex outdoor scenes.

Result: 在保持干净数据准确性的同时，达到了最先进的攻击性能，并对常见的后门防御方法表现出鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Noisy Alignment是一种简单而有效的数据投毒后门攻击方法，通过显式噪声对齐显著提升了攻击效果。

Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning (CL) effectively learns transferable
representations from unlabeled data containing images or image-text pairs but
suffers vulnerability to data poisoning backdoor attacks (DPCLs). An adversary
can inject poisoned images into pretraining datasets, causing compromised CL
encoders to exhibit targeted misbehavior in downstream tasks. Existing DPCLs,
however, achieve limited efficacy due to their dependence on fragile implicit
co-occurrence between backdoor and target object and inadequate suppression of
discriminative features in backdoored images. We propose Noisy Alignment (NA),
a DPCL method that explicitly suppresses noise components in poisoned images.
Inspired by powerful training-controllable CL attacks, we identify and extract
the critical objective of noisy alignment, adapting it effectively into
data-poisoning scenarios. Our method implements noisy alignment by
strategically manipulating contrastive learning's random cropping mechanism,
formulating this process as an image layout optimization problem with
theoretically derived optimal parameters. The resulting method is simple yet
effective, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to existing DPCLs,
while maintaining clean-data accuracy. Furthermore, Noisy Alignment
demonstrates robustness against common backdoor defenses. Codes can be found at

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in video AIGC have ushered in a transformative era for
audio-driven human animation. However, conventional video dubbing techniques
remain constrained to mouth region editing, resulting in discordant facial
expressions and body gestures that compromise viewer immersion. To overcome
this limitation, we introduce sparse-frame video dubbing, a novel paradigm that
strategically preserves reference keyframes to maintain identity, iconic
gestures, and camera trajectories while enabling holistic, audio-synchronized
full-body motion editing. Through critical analysis, we identify why naive
image-to-video models fail in this task, particularly their inability to
achieve adaptive conditioning. Addressing this, we propose InfiniteTalk, a
streaming audio-driven generator designed for infinite-length long sequence
dubbing. This architecture leverages temporal context frames for seamless
inter-chunk transitions and incorporates a simple yet effective sampling
strategy that optimizes control strength via fine-grained reference frame
positioning. Comprehensive evaluations on HDTF, CelebV-HQ, and EMTD datasets
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Quantitative metrics confirm superior
visual realism, emotional coherence, and full-body motion synchronization.

TL;DR: DetailGen3D是一个专门用于增强生成3D形状几何细节的方法，通过潜在空间中的数据依赖流实现粗到细的转换，避免了大模型的计算开销


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代3D生成方法虽然能够从稀疏或单视图快速创建形状，但由于计算限制，输出往往缺乏几何细节

Method: 采用数据依赖流在潜在空间建模粗到细转换，引入token匹配策略确保精化过程中的空间对应，保持全局结构的同时实现局部细节合成

Result: 能够有效增强各种3D生成和重建方法产生的形状，从单视图到稀疏多视图输入，实现高保真几何细节合成

Conclusion: DetailGen3D在保持训练效率的同时，实现了高质量的几何细节增强，可广泛应用于不同3D生成方法

Abstract: Modern 3D generation methods can rapidly create shapes from sparse or single
views, but their outputs often lack geometric detail due to computational
constraints. We present DetailGen3D, a generative approach specifically
designed to enhance these generated 3D shapes. Our key insight is to model the
coarse-to-fine transformation directly through data-dependent flows in latent
space, avoiding the computational overhead of large-scale 3D generative models.
We introduce a token matching strategy that ensures accurate spatial
correspondence during refinement, enabling local detail synthesis while
preserving global structure. By carefully designing our training data to match
the characteristics of synthesized coarse shapes, our method can effectively
enhance shapes produced by various 3D generation and reconstruction approaches,
from single-view to sparse multi-view inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that DetailGen3D achieves high-fidelity geometric detail synthesis while
maintaining efficiency in training.

TL;DR: 首个3D高斯拓扑矩阵的知识精继框架，通过多老师模型指导轻量化学生模型，在保持渲染质量的同时大幅减少存储需求


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D高斯拓扑矩阵(3DGS)在高保真渲染时需要大量3D高斯分布导致的内存消耗和存储问题

Method: 提出知识精继框架，使用普通3DGS、噪声增强版本和dropout正则化版本等多老师模型，通过结构相似性损失促进学生模型的空间几何结构一致性

Result: 在多样化数据集上进行完整评估，方法在渲染质量和存储效率方面都达到了领先水平

Conclusion: Distilled-3DGS是一个简单但高效的框架，无需复杂设计即可实现优秀的渲染效果和存储优化

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has exhibited remarkable efficacy in novel view
synthesis (NVS). However, it suffers from a significant drawback: achieving
high-fidelity rendering typically necessitates a large number of 3D Gaussians,
resulting in substantial memory consumption and storage requirements. To
address this challenge, we propose the first knowledge distillation framework
for 3DGS, featuring various teacher models, including vanilla 3DGS,
noise-augmented variants, and dropout-regularized versions. The outputs of
these teachers are aggregated to guide the optimization of a lightweight
student model. To distill the hidden geometric structure, we propose a
structural similarity loss to boost the consistency of spatial geometric
distributions between the student and teacher model. Through comprehensive
quantitative and qualitative evaluations across diverse datasets, the proposed
Distilled-3DGS, a simple yet effective framework without bells and whistles,
achieves promising rendering results in both rendering quality and storage
efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods. Project page:

Motivation: 标准检索框架在处理细粒度组合查询和时间变化时遇到困难，需要更好地对齐素蕴查询修改与目标视频。

Method: 构建包含160万样本的素蕴数据集，并使用基于地面文本编码器的交叉注意力融合机制来整合视觉和文本信息。

Conclusion: 该方法通过素蕴数据集和交叉注意力融合机制，有效提升了组合视频检索的精确性和性能。

Abstract: Composed video retrieval is a challenging task that strives to retrieve a
target video based on a query video and a textual description detailing
specific modifications. Standard retrieval frameworks typically struggle to
handle the complexity of fine-grained compositional queries and variations in
temporal understanding limiting their retrieval ability in the fine-grained
setting. To address this issue, we introduce a novel dataset that captures both
fine-grained and composed actions across diverse video segments, enabling more
detailed compositional changes in retrieved video content. The proposed
dataset, named Dense-WebVid-CoVR, consists of 1.6 million samples with dense
modification text that is around seven times more than its existing
counterpart. We further develop a new model that integrates visual and textual
information through Cross-Attention (CA) fusion using grounded text encoder,
enabling precise alignment between dense query modifications and target videos.
The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results surpassing existing
methods on all metrics. Notably, it achieves 71.3\% Recall@1 in visual+text
setting and outperforms the state-of-the-art by 3.4\%, highlighting its
efficacy in terms of leveraging detailed video descriptions and dense
modification texts. Our proposed dataset, code, and model are available at

casually captured long videos characterized by irregular camera motion, unknown
camera poses, and expansive scenes. Current methods often suffer from pose
drift, inaccurate geometry initialization, and severe memory limitations. To

Splatting framework featuring: (1) Incremental Joint Optimization that
concurrently optimizes camera poses and 3D Gaussians to avoid local minima and
ensure global consistency; (2) a robust Pose Estimation Module leveraging
learned 3D priors; and (3) an efficient Octree Anchor Formation mechanism that
converts dense point clouds into anchors based on spatial density. Extensive

TL;DR: 基于3D pCASL MRI的血管健康评估框架，通过超像素聚类和卷积神经网络识别性别特异血流模式，准确率达95%，为神经退血性疾病的早期识别提供新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究血管健康在神经退血性疾病中的作用，特别是性别特异的血流模式对疾病敏感性的影响，需要一种新的量化方法来评估脾血管健康和疾病风险。

Method: 使用3D伪连续动脉旋转标记(3D pCASL) MRI技术，通过超像素聚类将脾部划分为包含微血管和大血管贡献的包含均匀流泵的连续区域，并从186名认知健康参与者中提取平均脾血流(CBF)值，训练自定义卷积神经网络进行性别分类。

Result: 性别分类准确率达到95%，显示了脾部存在突出的性别特异流泵模式，同时系统评估了男性和女性群体内的区域CBF变化以及与年龄相关的影响。

Conclusion: 该血管风险评分框架增进了对正常脾流泵和老化过程的理解，有助于防止神经退血性疾病(如阿尔茫海默病)的早期发现和个性化干预。

Abstract: We propose a novel framework that leverages 3D pseudo-continuous arterial
spin labeling (3D pCASL) MRI to compute sex-specific vascular scores that
quantify cerebrovascular health and potential disease susceptibility. The brain
is parcellated into spatially contiguous regions of homogeneous perfusion using
supervoxel clustering, capturing both microvascular and macrovascular
contributions. Mean cerebral blood flow (CBF) values are extracted from 186
cognitively healthy participants and used to train a custom convolutional
neural network, achieving 95 percent accuracy in sex classification. This
highlights robust, sex-specific perfusion patterns across the brain.
Additionally, regional CBF variations and age-related effects are
systematically evaluated within male and female cohorts. The proposed vascular
risk-scoring framework enhances understanding of normative brain perfusion and
aging, and may facilitate early detection and personalized interventions for
neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's.

Abstract: Demyelinating disorders of the central nervous system may have multiple
causes, the most common are infections, autoimmune responses, genetic or
vascular etiology. Demyelination lesions are characterized by areas were the
myelin sheath of the nerve fibers are broken or destroyed. Among autoimmune
disorders, Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most well-known Among these
disorders, Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most well-known and aggressive form.
Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is another type of demyelinating
disease, typically with a better prognosis. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is
widely used for diagnosing and monitoring disease progression by detecting
lesions. While both adults and children can be affected, there is a significant
lack of publicly available datasets for pediatric cases and demyelinating
disorders beyond MS. This study introduces, for the first time, a publicly
available pediatric dataset for demyelinating lesion segmentation. The dataset
comprises MRI scans from 13 pediatric patients diagnosed with demyelinating
disorders, including 3 with ADEM. In addition to lesion segmentation masks, the
dataset includes extensive patient metadata, such as diagnosis, treatment,
personal medical background, and laboratory results. To assess the quality of
the dataset and demonstrate its relevance, we evaluate a state-of-the-art
lesion segmentation model trained on an existing MS dataset. The results
underscore the importance of diverse datasets

Conclusion: 该自动化VIA系统为资源稀缺地区提供了一种有效、可扩展的子宫预防筛查解决方案，有力推动公共健康筛查程序

Abstract: Cervical cancer is among the most commonly occurring cancer among women and
claims a huge number of lives in low and middle-income countries despite being
relatively easy to treat. Several studies have shown that public screening
programs can bring down cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates
significantly. While several screening tests are available, visual inspection
with acetic acid (VIA) presents itself as the most viable option for
low-resource settings due to the affordability and simplicity of performing the
test. VIA requires a trained medical professional to interpret the test and is
subjective in nature. Automating VIA using AI eliminates subjectivity and would
allow shifting of the task to less trained health workers. Task shifting with
AI would help further expedite screening programs in low-resource settings. In
our work, we propose a lightweight deep learning algorithm that includes
EfficientDet-Lite3 as the Region of Interest (ROI) detector and a MobileNet- V2
based model for classification. These models would be deployed on an
android-based device that can operate remotely and provide almost instant
results without the requirement of highly-trained medical professionals, labs,
sophisticated infrastructure, or internet connectivity. The classification
model gives an accuracy of 92.31%, a sensitivity of 98.24%, and a specificity
of 88.37% on the test dataset and presents itself as a promising automated
low-resource screening approach.

Result: 有效地从稀疏切片数据重建了平滑详细的内部结构

Conclusion: 该方法为内部场景重建提供了一种高效、灵活且无需相机位姬的解决方案

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently gained popularity for efficient
scene rendering by representing scenes as explicit sets of anisotropic 3D
Gaussians. However, most existing work focuses primarily on modeling external
surfaces. In this work, we target the reconstruction of internal scenes, which
is crucial for applications that require a deep understanding of an object's
interior. By directly modeling a continuous volumetric density through the
inner 3D Gaussian distribution, our model effectively reconstructs smooth and
detailed internal structures from sparse sliced data. Our approach eliminates
the need for camera poses, is plug-and-play, and is inherently compatible with
any data modalities. We provide cuda implementation at:

Conclusion: 该深度学习方法作为一种高效且实用的替代方案，在dMRI碱性扭曲美正方面具有广阔的应用前景。

Abstract: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) is a valuable tool to map brain microstructure and
connectivity by analyzing water molecule diffusion in tissue. However,
acquiring dMRI data requires to capture multiple 3D brain volumes in a short
time, often leading to trade-offs in image quality. One challenging artifact is
susceptibility-induced distortion, which introduces significant geometric and
intensity deformations. Traditional correction methods, such as topup, rely on
having access to blip-up and blip-down image pairs, limiting their
applicability to retrospective data acquired with a single phase encoding
direction. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based approach to correct
susceptibility distortions using only a single acquisition (either blip-up or
blip-down), eliminating the need for paired acquisitions. Experimental results
show that our method achieves performance comparable to topup, demonstrating
its potential as an efficient and practical alternative for susceptibility
distortion correction in dMRI.

Abstract: Whole-Slide Image (WSI) is an important tool for evaluating the prognosis of
cancer patients. Present WSI-based prognosis studies generally follow a
conventional paradigm -- cancer-specific model development -- where one cancer
disease corresponds to one model and this model cannot make use of the
prognostic knowledge from others. Despite its notable success in recent years,
this paradigm has inherent limitations and has always been struggling with
practical requirements: (i) scaling to the rare tumor diseases with very
limited samples and (ii) benefiting from the generalizable prognostic knowledge
in other cancers. To this end, this paper presents the first systematic study
on Prognostic Knowledge Transfer in Pathology, called Path-PKT. It comprises
three main parts. (1) We curate a large dataset (UNI2-h-DSS) with 13 cancers
and use it to evaluate the transferability of prognostic knowledge between
different cancers computationally. (2) We design experiments to understand what
factors affect knowledge transfer and what causes positive transfers. (3)
Motivated by empirical findings, we propose a new baseline approach (MoE-PKT)
with a routing mechanism to utilize the generalizable prognostic knowledge in
other cancers. Finally, we show the transferability of source models to rare
tumor diseases. This study could lay solid foundations for the study of
knowledge transfer in WSI-based cancer prognosis. Source code is available at

Method: 系统综述方法，分析了46个公开腹部CT数据集（共50,256例研究），对其中19个≥100例的数据集进行了偏差评估。

Result: 发现显著的数据冗余（59.1%病例重复使用）和西方/地域偏差（75.3%来自北美和欧洲）。在偏差评估中，最常见的风险类别是领域偏移（63%）和选择偏差（57%），这些可能削弱模型在不同医疗环境中的泛化能力。

Abstract: This systematic review critically evaluates publicly available abdominal CT
datasets and their suitability for artificial intelligence (AI) applications in
clinical settings. We examined 46 publicly available abdominal CT datasets
(50,256 studies). Across all 46 datasets, we found substantial redundancy
(59.1\% case reuse) and a Western/geographic skew (75.3\% from North America
and Europe). A bias assessment was performed on the 19 datasets with >=100
cases; within this subset, the most prevalent high-risk categories were domain
shift (63\%) and selection bias (57\%), both of which may undermine model
generalizability across diverse healthcare environments -- particularly in
resource-limited settings. To address these challenges, we propose targeted
strategies for dataset improvement, including multi-institutional
collaboration, adoption of standardized protocols, and deliberate inclusion of
diverse patient populations and imaging technologies. These efforts are crucial
in supporting the development of more equitable and clinically robust AI models
for abdominal imaging.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: High-throughput screening using automated microscopes is a key driver in
biopharma drug discovery, enabling the parallel evaluation of thousands of drug
candidates for diseases such as cancer. Traditional image analysis and deep
learning approaches have been employed to analyze these complex, large-scale
datasets, with cell segmentation serving as a critical step for extracting
relevant structures. However, both strategies typically require extensive
manual parameter tuning or domain-specific model fine-tuning. We present a
novel method that applies a segmentation foundation model in a zero-shot
setting (i.e., without fine-tuning), guided by an in-context learning strategy.
Our approach employs a three-step process for nuclei, cell, and subcellular
segmentation, introducing a self-prompting mechanism that encodes morphological
and topological priors using growing masks and strategically placed
foreground/background points. We validate our method on both standard cell
segmentation benchmarks and industry-relevant hit validation assays,
demonstrating that it accurately segments biologically relevant structures
without the need for dataset-specific tuning.

Abstract: With the widespread use of the internet, there is an increasing need to
ensure the security and privacy of transmitted data. This has led to an
intensified focus on the study of video steganography, which is a technique
that hides data within a video cover to avoid detection. The effectiveness of
any steganography method depends on its ability to embed data without altering
the original video quality while maintaining high efficiency. This paper
proposes a new method to video steganography, which involves utilizing a
Genetic Algorithm (GA) for identifying the Region of Interest (ROI) in the
cover video. The ROI is the area in the video that is the most suitable for
data embedding. The secret data is encrypted using the Advanced Encryption
Standard (AES), which is a widely accepted encryption standard, before being
embedded into the cover video, utilizing up to 10% of the cover video. This
process ensures the security and confidentiality of the embedded data. The
performance metrics for assessing the proposed method are the Peak Signal to
Noise Ratio (PSNR) and the encoding and decoding time. The results show that
the proposed method has a high embedding capacity and efficiency, with a PSNR
ranging between 64 and 75 dBs, which indicates that the embedded data is almost
indistinguishable from the original video. Additionally, the method can encode
and decode data quickly, making it efficient for real time applications.

Motivation: 神经外科手术中的脑部移位导致导航失准，现有关键点注册方法依赖简单几何插值而忽视组织生物力学特性，需要更物理可行的变形场估计方法。

Method: 首先使用生物力学模拟生成大量合成脑部变形数据集，然后训练殊差3D U-Net网络，将标准插值结果精炼为生物力学引导的密集变形场。

Result: 在大量模拟变形场上的实验显示，该方法显著超越传统插值方法，平均方差错误降低50%，且推理时计算开销可忽略。

Conclusion: 深度生物力学插值器能够从稀疏关键点生成物理可行的密集变形场，为神经外科导航提供更准确的脑部移位补偿。

Abstract: Accurate compensation of brain shift is critical for maintaining the
reliability of neuronavigation during neurosurgery. While keypoint-based
registration methods offer robustness to large deformations and topological
changes, they typically rely on simple geometric interpolators that ignore
tissue biomechanics to create dense displacement fields. In this work, we
propose a novel deep learning framework that estimates dense, physically
plausible brain deformations from sparse matched keypoints. We first generate a
large dataset of synthetic brain deformations using biomechanical simulations.
Then, a residual 3D U-Net is trained to refine standard interpolation estimates
into biomechanically guided deformations. Experiments on a large set of
simulated displacement fields demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms classical interpolators, reducing by half the mean square error
while introducing negligible computational overhead at inference time. Code

Motivation: 动态对比增强MRI对乳腺癌诊断至关重要，但使用对比剂存在安全性问题、禁忌症、成本增加和工作流程复杂性，需要开发无对比剂的替代方案。

Method: 提出预对比条件去噪扩散概率模型，引入肿瘤感知损失函数和显式肿瘤分割掩码条件，在公共多中心数据集上评估22种生成模型变体。

Result: 基于减影图像的模型在五个互补评估指标上始终优于基于后对比的模型，肿瘤感知损失和分割掩码输入都提高了评估指标，合成图像具有高真实感。

Conclusion: 生成对比增强技术显示出新兴的临床潜力，reader研究证实合成图像的高真实感，但肿瘤定位输入在筛查环境中不一定可用。

Abstract: Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI is essential for breast cancer diagnosis
and treatment. However, its reliance on contrast agents introduces safety
concerns, contraindications, increased cost, and workflow complexity. To this
end, we present pre-contrast conditioned denoising diffusion probabilistic
models to synthesize DCE-MRI, introducing, evaluating, and comparing a total of
22 generative model variants in both single-breast and full breast settings.
Towards enhancing lesion fidelity, we introduce both tumor-aware loss functions
and explicit tumor segmentation mask conditioning. Using a public multicenter
dataset and comparing to respective pre-contrast baselines, we observe that
subtraction image-based models consistently outperform post-contrast-based
models across five complementary evaluation metrics. Apart from assessing the
entire image, we also separately evaluate the region of interest, where both
tumor-aware losses and segmentation mask inputs improve evaluation metrics. The
latter notably enhance qualitative results capturing contrast uptake, albeit
assuming access to tumor localization inputs that are not guaranteed to be
available in screening settings. A reader study involving 2 radiologists and 4
MRI technologists confirms the high realism of the synthetic images, indicating
an emerging clinical potential of generative contrast-enhancement. We share our
codebase at https://github.com/sebastibar/conditional-diffusion-breast-MRI.

Motivation: DSA图像主要可视化血管，软组织解剖结构可见性差，需要在脑部血管治疗时提供更好的解剖可视化

Method: 使用nnUNet深度学习模型，基于361名脉骨染病人的1224份最小强度投影DSA图像，训练手动分割的脑内颈动脉和中央动脉血管领域

Result: 模型DSC达到0.96（地图法0.82），ASD为13.8（地图法47.3），外部测试成功率85%vs66%，均显著优于传统方法

Conclusion: 深度学习方法在DSA图像中分割无明显边界的血管领域方面显示出优异性能，有潜力应用于其他解剖结构的增强可视化，代码已开源

Abstract: X-ray digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is frequently used when
evaluating minimally invasive medical interventions. DSA predominantly
visualizes vessels, and soft tissue anatomy is less visible or invisible in
DSA. Visualization of cerebral anatomy could aid physicians during treatment.
This study aimed to develop and evaluate a deep learning model to predict
vascular territories that are not explicitly visible in DSA imaging acquired
during ischemic stroke treatment. We trained an nnUNet model with manually
segmented intracranial carotid artery and middle cerebral artery vessel
territories on minimal intensity projection DSA acquired during ischemic stroke
treatment. We compared the model to a traditional atlas registration model
using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and average surface distance (ASD).
Additionally, we qualitatively assessed the success rate in both models using
an external test. The segmentation model was trained on 1224 acquisitions from
361 patients with ischemic stroke. The segmentation model had a significantly
higher DSC (0.96 vs 0.82, p<0.001) and lower ASD compared to the atlas model
(13.8 vs 47.3, p<0.001). The success rate of the segmentation model (85%) was
higher compared to the atlas registration model (66%) in the external test set.
A deep learning method for the segmentation of vascular territories without
explicit borders on cerebral DSA demonstrated superior accuracy and quality
compared to the traditional atlas-based method. This approach has the potential
to be applied to other anatomical structures for enhanced visualization during
X-ray guided medical procedures. The code is publicly available at

Motivation: 当前深度学习MRI重建研究多关注网络架构，而忽视了数据筛选策略的重要性，本文研究如何通过数据筛选提高重建性能

Method: 构建包含18个公开来源、1.1M图像的大规模k空间数据集，设计48个多样化测试集，探索不同的数据筛选策略对状态前沿网络的影响

Result: 数据筛选能带来一致但较小的性能提升，这种提升在不同训练集规模和加速比下都很稳健，尤其是当未筛选训练集中分布内数据比例较低时效果更为显著

Conclusion: 数据筛选策略是改喂MRI重建模型性能的有效方法，尤其在数据质量不均匀时效果更佳，为深度学习医学形态重建提供了新的数据管理思路

Abstract: Deep neural networks achieve state-of-the-art results for accelerated MRI
reconstruction. Most research on deep learning based imaging focuses on
improving neural network architectures trained and evaluated on fixed and
homogeneous training and evaluation data. In this work, we investigate data
curation strategies for improving MRI reconstruction. We assemble a large
dataset of raw k-space data from 18 public sources consisting of 1.1M images
and construct a diverse evaluation set comprising 48 test sets, capturing
variations in anatomy, contrast, number of coils, and other key factors. We
propose and study different data filtering strategies to enhance performance of
current state-of-the-art neural networks for accelerated MRI reconstruction.
Our experiments show that filtering the training data leads to consistent,
albeit modest, performance gains. These performance gains are robust across
different training set sizes and accelerations, and we find that filtering is
particularly beneficial when the proportion of in-distribution data in the
unfiltered training set is low.

Conclusion: CaLID框架充分解决了现有方法的根本限制，在空间和时空心脏重建方面推进了技术状态，为心血管成像提供了健壮且临床实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) imaging is a critical tool for diagnosing
and managing cardiovascular disease, yet its utility is often limited by the
sparse acquisition of 2D short-axis slices, resulting in incomplete volumetric
information. Accurate 3D reconstruction from these sparse slices is essential
for comprehensive cardiac assessment, but existing methods face challenges,
including reliance on predefined interpolation schemes (e.g., linear or
spherical), computational inefficiency, and dependence on additional semantic
inputs such as segmentation labels or motion data. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel \textbf{Ca}rdiac \textbf{L}atent
\textbf{I}nterpolation \textbf{D}iffusion (CaLID) framework that introduces
three key innovations. First, we present a data-driven interpolation scheme
based on diffusion models, which can capture complex, non-linear relationships
between sparse slices and improves reconstruction accuracy. Second, we design a
computationally efficient method that operates in the latent space and speeds
up 3D whole-heart upsampling time by a factor of 24, reducing computational
overhead compared to previous methods. Third, with only sparse 2D CMR images as
input, our method achieves SOTA performance against baseline methods,
eliminating the need for auxiliary input such as morphological guidance, thus
simplifying workflows. We further extend our method to 2D+T data, enabling the
effective modeling of spatiotemporal dynamics and ensuring temporal coherence.
Extensive volumetric evaluations and downstream segmentation tasks demonstrate
that CaLID achieves superior reconstruction quality and efficiency. By
addressing the fundamental limitations of existing approaches, our framework
advances the state of the art for spatio and spatiotemporal whole-heart
reconstruction, offering a robust and clinically practical solution for
cardiovascular imaging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经颅彩色多普勒(TCCD)在脑血流评估中具有无辐射、经济可及的优势，但依赖操作者经验识别解剖标志和角度校正，限制了其广泛应用。需要AI解决方案来克服这一限制。

Method: 开发了新颖的Attention-Augmented Wavelet YOLO (AAW-YOLO)网络，专门针对TCCD数据设计，用于实时脑血管分割。前瞻性收集738个标注帧和3,419个标记动脉实例的高质量数据集进行训练评估。

Conclusion: 该系统为TCCD脑血管筛查提供了实用解决方案，可减少对操作者经验的依赖，有望应用于常规临床工作流程和资源有限环境。未来将探索双侧建模和大规模验证。

Abstract: The Circle of Willis (CoW), vital for ensuring consistent blood flow to the
brain, is closely linked to ischemic stroke. Accurate assessment of the CoW is
important for identifying individuals at risk and guiding appropriate clinical
management. Among existing imaging methods, Transcranial Color-coded Doppler
(TCCD) offers unique advantages due to its radiation-free nature,
affordability, and accessibility. However, reliable TCCD assessments depend
heavily on operator expertise for identifying anatomical landmarks and
performing accurate angle correction, which limits its widespread adoption. To
address this challenge, we propose an AI-powered, real-time CoW
auto-segmentation system capable of efficiently capturing cerebral arteries. No
prior studies have explored AI-driven cerebrovascular segmentation using TCCD.
In this work, we introduce a novel Attention-Augmented Wavelet YOLO (AAW-YOLO)
network tailored for TCCD data, designed to provide real-time guidance for
brain vessel segmentation in the CoW. We prospectively collected TCCD data
comprising 738 annotated frames and 3,419 labeled artery instances to establish
a high-quality dataset for model training and evaluation. The proposed AAW-YOLO
demonstrated strong performance in segmenting both ipsilateral and
contralateral CoW vessels, achieving an average Dice score of 0.901, IoU of
0.823, precision of 0.882, recall of 0.926, and mAP of 0.953, with a per-frame
inference speed of 14.199 ms. This system offers a practical solution to reduce
reliance on operator experience in TCCD-based cerebrovascular screening, with
potential applications in routine clinical workflows and resource-constrained
settings. Future research will explore bilateral modeling and larger-scale
validation.

Motivation: 机器视觉系统容易受到激光耀斑的影响，强烈的激光照射会导致传感器过饱和或永久性像素损坏，影响环境感知能力。现有方法无法在全可见光谱范围内有效保护传感器。

Method: 联合学习衍射光学元件(DOE)的神经表示和频域Mamba-GAN网络进行图像恢复。采用对抗训练端到端方式，在10万张独特图像上训练，整合高光谱信息和多个神经网络进行真实模拟和图像恢复。

Abstract: Machine vision systems are susceptible to laser flare, where unwanted intense
laser illumination blinds and distorts its perception of the environment
through oversaturation or permanent damage to sensor pixels. We introduce
NeuSee, the first computational imaging framework for high-fidelity sensor
protection across the full visible spectrum. It jointly learns a neural
representation of a diffractive optical element (DOE) and a frequency-space
Mamba-GAN network for image restoration. NeuSee system is adversarially trained
end-to-end on 100K unique images to suppress the peak laser irradiance as high
as $10^6$ times the sensor saturation threshold $I_{\textrm{sat}}$, the point
at which camera sensors may experience damage without the DOE. Our system
leverages heterogeneous data and model parallelism for distributed computing,
integrating hyperspectral information and multiple neural networks for
realistic simulation and image restoration. NeuSee takes into account
open-world scenes with dynamically varying laser wavelengths, intensities, and
positions, as well as lens flare effects, unknown ambient lighting conditions,
and sensor noises. It outperforms other learned DOEs, achieving full-spectrum

Abstract: Purpose: Deep learning methods have shown promising results in the
segmentation, and detection of diseases in medical images. However, most
methods are trained and tested on data from a single source, modality, organ,
or disease type, overlooking the combined potential of other available
annotated data. Numerous small annotated medical image datasets from various
modalities, organs, and diseases are publicly available. In this work, we aim
to leverage the synergistic potential of these datasets to improve performance
on unseen data. Approach: To this end, we propose a novel algorithm called
MMIS-Net (MultiModal Medical Image Segmentation Network), which features
Similarity Fusion blocks that utilize supervision and pixel-wise similarity
knowledge selection for feature map fusion. Additionally, to address
inconsistent class definitions and label contradictions, we created a one-hot
label space to handle classes absent in one dataset but annotated in another.
MMIS-Net was trained on 10 datasets encompassing 19 organs across 2 modalities
to build a single model. Results: The algorithm was evaluated on the RETOUCH
grand challenge hidden test set, outperforming large foundation models for
medical image segmentation and other state-of-the-art algorithms. We achieved
the best mean Dice score of 0.83 and an absolute volume difference of 0.035 for
the fluids segmentation task, as well as a perfect Area Under the Curve of 1
for the fluid detection task. Conclusion: The quantitative results highlight
the effectiveness of our proposed model due to the incorporation of Similarity
Fusion blocks into the network's backbone for supervision and similarity
knowledge selection, and the use of a one-hot label space to address label
class inconsistencies and contradictions.

Abstract: Patient-specific bone models are essential for designing surgical guides and
preoperative planning, as they enable the visualization of intricate anatomical
structures. However, traditional CT-based approaches for creating bone models
are limited to preoperative use due to the low flexibility and high radiation
exposure of CT and time-consuming manual delineation. Here, we introduce
Semi-Supervised Reconstruction with Knowledge Distillation (SSR-KD), a fast and
accurate AI framework to reconstruct high-quality bone models from biplanar
X-rays in 30 seconds, with an average error under 1.0 mm, eliminating the
dependence on CT and manual work. Additionally, high tibial osteotomy
simulation was performed by experts on reconstructed bone models, demonstrating
that bone models reconstructed from biplanar X-rays have comparable clinical
applicability to those annotated from CT. Overall, our approach accelerates the
process, reduces radiation exposure, enables intraoperative guidance, and
significantly improves the practicality of bone models, offering transformative
applications in orthopedics.

Motivation: 医学影像数据稀缺，为每个领域、模态或任务预训练基础模型具有挑战性。持续学习可以通过顺序微调模型来整合新知识，而无需每个训练阶段都使用大型数据集。

Method: 提出UNICON框架，通过精心整合使基础模型能够动态扩展到成像模态、解剖区域和临床目标，而不会发生灾难性遗忘或任务干扰。

Result: 将胸部CT基础模型从分类任务适应到预后和分割任务，在两个附加任务上都表现出改进的性能。持续整合PET扫描后，Dice分数比相应基线提高了5%。

Conclusion: 基础模型并不固有地受限于其初始训练范围，而是可以不断演化，这为医学影像通用AI模型的发展铺平了道路。

Abstract: Foundational models are trained on extensive datasets to capture the general
trends of a domain. However, in medical imaging, the scarcity of data makes
pre-training for every domain, modality, or task challenging. Continual
learning offers a solution by fine-tuning a model sequentially on different
domains or tasks, enabling it to integrate new knowledge without requiring
large datasets for each training phase. In this paper, we propose UNIfied
CONtinual Learning for Medical Foundational Models (UNICON), a framework that
enables the seamless adaptation of foundation models to diverse domains, tasks,
and modalities. Unlike conventional adaptation methods that treat these changes
in isolation, UNICON provides a unified, perpetually expandable framework.
Through careful integration, we show that foundation models can dynamically
expand across imaging modalities, anatomical regions, and clinical objectives
without catastrophic forgetting or task interference. Empirically, we validate
our approach by adapting a chest CT foundation model initially trained for
classification to a prognosis and segmentation task. Our results show improved
performance across both additional tasks. Furthermore, we continually
incorporated PET scans and achieved a 5\% improvement in Dice score compared to
respective baselines. These findings establish that foundation models are not
inherently constrained to their initial training scope but can evolve, paving
the way toward generalist AI models for medical imaging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医生对医疗AI系统的信任度低，主要因为医疗AI仅依靠病变数据进行诊断，缺乏医生所拥有的丰富背景知识和临床经验，导致诊断不确定性。

Method: 提出不确定性感知学习策略，同时学习医生的背景知识和胸部X光片病变信息。使用了来自Ajou大学医院2,517张无病变图像和656张节节图像。

Result: 提出模型达到92%的性能（IoU 0.2 / FPPI 2），敏感度比基准模型提高10%，并将作为不确定性指标的熵提降低了0.2。

Conclusion: 通过学习医生的背景知识，可以有效解决医疗AI的知识缺乏问题，降低诊断不确定性，从而提高医生对医疗AI系统的信任度。

Abstract: Early detection and rapid intervention of lung cancer are crucial.
Nonetheless, ensuring an accurate diagnosis is challenging, as physicians'
ability to interpret chest X-rays varies significantly depending on their
experience and degree of fatigue. Although medical AI has been rapidly
advancing to assist in diagnosis, physicians' trust in such systems remains
limited, preventing widespread clinical adoption. This skepticism fundamentally
stems from concerns about its diagnostic uncertainty. In clinical diagnosis,
physicians utilize extensive background knowledge and clinical experience. In
contrast, medical AI primarily relies on repetitive learning of the target
lesion to generate diagnoses based solely on that data. In other words, medical
AI does not possess sufficient knowledge to render a diagnosis, leading to
diagnostic uncertainty. Thus, this study suggests an Uncertainty-Aware Learning
Policy that can address the issue of knowledge deficiency by learning the
physicians' background knowledge alongside the Chest X-ray lesion information.
We used 2,517 lesion-free images and 656 nodule images, all obtained from Ajou
University Hospital. The proposed model attained 92% (IoU 0.2 / FPPI 2) with a
10% enhancement in sensitivity compared to the baseline model while also
decreasing entropy as a measure of uncertainty by 0.2.

Motivation: 为了解决传统NeRF方法在场景表面重建中训练时间长、对噪声敏感以及缺乏语义理解的问题，需要开发一种能够快速、高质量重建并整合语义信息的方法。

Method: 提出新颖的SG-MLP采样结构结合PR-MLP进行体素预渲染，采用渐进式语义建模方法在不同精度级别提取语义信息，从而提前捕获场景相关信息并更好地区分噪声与局部细节。

Result: 在7个合成场景的6个评估指标测试中，PreSem-Surf在C-L1、F-score和IoU指标上取得最佳性能，同时在NC、Accuracy和Completeness指标上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: PreSem-Surf方法有效提高了场景表面重建的质量和效率，证明了其在整合多模态信息进行快速高质量重建方面的有效性和实际应用价值。

Abstract: This paper proposes PreSem-Surf, an optimized method based on the Neural
Radiance Field (NeRF) framework, capable of reconstructing high-quality scene
surfaces from RGB-D sequences in a short time. The method integrates RGB,
depth, and semantic information to improve reconstruction performance.
Specifically, a novel SG-MLP sampling structure combined with PR-MLP
(Preconditioning Multilayer Perceptron) is introduced for voxel pre-rendering,
allowing the model to capture scene-related information earlier and better

Motivation: 在复杂几何、异质材料和高分辨率输入数据下，保持IPC模拟的稳健性和视觉保真度，同时提高计算效率

Method: 提出新颖的稀疏、几何和材料感知的基准构建方法，代替稀疏直接求解器，使用快速预处理共轭梯度求解器(PCG)，避免困扰粗算或异质材料导致的收敛问题

Abstract: We present a multi-level elastodynamics timestep solver for accelerating
incremental potential contact (IPC) simulations. Our method retains the
robustness of gold standard IPC in the face of intricate geometry, complex
heterogeneous material distributions and high resolution input data without
sacrificing visual fidelity (per-timestep relative displacement error of
$\approx1\%$). The success of our method is enabled by a novel, sparse,
geometry- and material-aware basis construction method which allows for the use
of fast preconditioned conjugate gradient solvers (in place of a sparse direct
solver), but without suffering convergence issues due to stiff or heterogeneous
materials. The end result is a solver that produces results visually
indistinguishable and quantitatively very close to gold-standard IPC methods
but up to $13\times$ faster on identical hardware.

TL;DR: DiffPlanner是一个基于Transformer的条件扩散模型，直接在向量空间中生成边界约束的平面图布局，避免了传统方法中向量-栅格-向量转换的信息损失问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的学习型平面图生成方法需要将向量数据转换为栅格图像进行处理，这个过程复杂冗余且会导致信息损失。栅格图像无法无损缩放，限制了生成质量。

Method: 提出基于Transformer的条件扩散模型，在训练中集成对齐机制，使模型优化轨迹与设计师的迭代设计过程对齐，直接在向量空间中处理复杂数据。

Conclusion: 直接在向量空间中操作的DiffPlanner框架解决了传统方法的信息损失问题，能够更好地处理复杂向量数据，实现高质量、用户可控的平面图生成。

Abstract: The boundary-constrained floor plan generation problem aims to generate the
topological and geometric properties of a set of rooms within a given boundary.
Recently, learning-based methods have made significant progress in generating
realistic floor plans. However, these methods involve a workflow of converting
vector data into raster images, using image-based generative models, and then
converting the results back into vector data. This process is complex and
redundant, often resulting in information loss. Raster images, unlike vector
data, cannot scale without losing detail and precision. To address these
issues, we propose a novel deep learning framework called DiffPlanner for
boundary-constrained floor plan generation, which operates entirely in vector
space. Our framework is a Transformer-based conditional diffusion model that
integrates an alignment mechanism in training, aligning the optimization
trajectory of the model with the iterative design processes of designers. This
enables our model to handle complex vector data, better fit the distribution of
the predicted targets, accomplish the challenging task of floor plan layout
design, and achieve user-controllable generation. We conduct quantitative
comparisons, qualitative evaluations, ablation experiments, and perceptual
studies to evaluate our method. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
DiffPlanner surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in generating floor
plans and bubble diagrams in the creative stages, offering more controllability
to users and producing higher-quality results that closely match the ground
truths.

TL;DR: Sketch3DVE是一个基于草图的3D感知视频编辑方法，能够处理大视角变化下的视频结构内容编辑，通过点云编辑和3D感知掩码传播实现精确的几何控制。


<details>

Motivation: 现有视频编辑方法在风格迁移和外观修改方面表现良好，但在处理大视角变化（如大角度相机旋转或缩放）时的3D场景结构内容编辑仍然具有挑战性，需要解决新视角内容生成、未编辑区域保持和稀疏2D输入到3D视频输出的转换问题。

Method: 采用图像编辑方法生成第一帧的编辑结果并传播到后续帧；使用草图作为交互工具进行精确几何控制；利用稠密立体方法估计点云和相机参数；提出基于深度图的点云编辑方法表示新编辑组件的3D几何；引入3D感知掩码传播策略并使用视频扩散模型生成逼真编辑视频。

Result: 大量实验证明了Sketch3DVE在视频编辑方面的优越性，能够有效处理大视角变化下的3D场景结构编辑任务。

Conclusion: Sketch3DVE通过结合3D信息分析和点云编辑技术，成功解决了大视角变化视频中的结构内容编辑难题，为基于草图的精确3D视频编辑提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent video editing methods achieve attractive results in style transfer or
appearance modification. However, editing the structural content of 3D scenes
in videos remains challenging, particularly when dealing with significant
viewpoint changes, such as large camera rotations or zooms. Key challenges
include generating novel view content that remains consistent with the original
video, preserving unedited regions, and translating sparse 2D inputs into
realistic 3D video outputs. To address these issues, we propose Sketch3DVE, a
sketch-based 3D-aware video editing method to enable detailed local
manipulation of videos with significant viewpoint changes. To solve the
challenge posed by sparse inputs, we employ image editing methods to generate
edited results for the first frame, which are then propagated to the remaining
frames of the video. We utilize sketching as an interaction tool for precise
geometry control, while other mask-based image editing methods are also
supported. To handle viewpoint changes, we perform a detailed analysis and
manipulation of the 3D information in the video. Specifically, we utilize a
dense stereo method to estimate a point cloud and the camera parameters of the
input video. We then propose a point cloud editing approach that uses depth
maps to represent the 3D geometry of newly edited components, aligning them
effectively with the original 3D scene. To seamlessly merge the newly edited
content with the original video while preserving the features of unedited
regions, we introduce a 3D-aware mask propagation strategy and employ a video
diffusion model to produce realistic edited videos. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority of Sketch3DVE in video editing. Homepage and code:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NeRF使用直线体积渲染，难以处理复杂光路场景，在处理运动模糊图像时会产生几何模糊问题。

Method: 提出散射感知体积渲染管道，统一六种常见光传播现象；引入自适应学习策略确定散射方向和采样间隔；联合优化NeRF参数、散射参数和相机运动。

Conclusion: Is-NeRF通过显式光路建模和散射感知渲染，成功解决了NeRF在处理运动模糊图像时的局限性，为复杂光路场景提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has gained significant attention for its
prominent implicit 3D representation and realistic novel view synthesis
capabilities. Available works unexceptionally employ straight-line volume
rendering, which struggles to handle sophisticated lightpath scenarios and
introduces geometric ambiguities during training, particularly evident when
processing motion-blurred images. To address these challenges, this work
proposes a novel deblur neural radiance field, Is-NeRF, featuring explicit
lightpath modeling in real-world environments. By unifying six common light
propagation phenomena through an in-scattering representation, we establish a
new scattering-aware volume rendering pipeline adaptable to complex lightpaths.
Additionally, we introduce an adaptive learning strategy that enables
autonomous determining of scattering directions and sampling intervals to
capture finer object details. The proposed network jointly optimizes NeRF
parameters, scattering parameters, and camera motions to recover fine-grained
scene representations from blurry images. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate
that it effectively handles complex real-world scenarios, outperforming
state-of-the-art approaches in generating high-fidelity images with accurate
geometric details.

Abstract: We build a mobile surveillance robot that streams video in real time and
responds to speech so a user can monitor and steer it from a phone or browser.
The system uses two Raspberry Pi 4 units: a front unit on a differential drive
base with camera, mic, and speaker, and a central unit that serves the live
feed and runs perception. Video is sent with FFmpeg. Objects in the scene are
detected using YOLOv3 to support navigation and event awareness. For voice
interaction, we use Python libraries for speech recognition, multilingual
translation, and text-to-speech, so the robot can take spoken commands and read
back responses in the requested language. A Kinect RGB-D sensor provides visual
input and obstacle cues. In indoor tests the robot detects common objects at
interactive frame rates on CPU, recognises commands reliably, and translates
them to actions without manual control. The design relies on off-the-shelf
hardware and open software, making it easy to reproduce. We discuss limits and
practical extensions, including sensor fusion with ultrasonic range data, GPU
acceleration, and adding face and text recognition.

TL;DR: ROVER是一种利用历史轨迹作为先验约束来在重复环境中验证闭环检测的方法，通过位姿图优化和轨迹一致性评分来拒绝错误闭环


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在重复环境中，基于外观特征的闭环检测容易产生误检，现有方法主要关注学习不变的外观特征，而忽略了机器人的时空运动轨迹先验知识

Method: 对于每个闭环候选，首先通过位姿图优化估计机器人轨迹，然后通过评分方案评估该轨迹与无闭环时的轨迹先验的一致性，从而决定是否接受该闭环

Result: 基准测试和真实世界实验证明了该方法的有效性，集成到最先进的SLAM系统中验证了其鲁棒性和效率

Conclusion: ROVER通过利用轨迹先验约束，在具有挑战性的重复环境中有效拒绝错误闭环，提高了闭环检测的可靠性

Abstract: Loop closure detection is important for simultaneous localization and mapping
(SLAM), which associates current observations with historical keyframes,
achieving drift correction and global relocalization. However, a falsely
detected loop can be fatal, and this is especially difficult in repetitive
environments where appearance-based features fail due to the high similarity.
Therefore, verification of a loop closure is a critical step in avoiding false
positive detections. Existing works in loop closure verification predominantly
focus on learning invariant appearance features, neglecting the prior knowledge
of the robot's spatial-temporal motion cue, i.e., trajectory. In this letter,
we propose ROVER, a loop closure verification method that leverages the
historical trajectory as a prior constraint to reject false loops in
challenging repetitive environments. For each loop candidate, it is first used
to estimate the robot trajectory with pose-graph optimization. This trajectory
is then submitted to a scoring scheme that assesses its compliance with the
trajectory without the loop, which we refer to as the trajectory prior, to
determine if the loop candidate should be accepted. Benchmark comparisons and
real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
Furthermore, we integrate ROVER into state-of-the-art SLAM systems to verify
its robustness and efficiency. Our source code and self-collected dataset are

Abstract: Imitating tool manipulation from human videos offers an intuitive approach to
teaching robots, while also providing a promising and scalable alternative to
labor-intensive teleoperation data collection for visuomotor policy learning.
While humans can mimic tool manipulation behavior by observing others perform a
task just once and effortlessly transfer the skill to diverse tools for
functionally equivalent tasks, current robots struggle to achieve this level of
generalization. A key challenge lies in establishing function-level
correspondences, considering the significant geometric variations among
functionally similar tools, referred to as intra-function variations. To
address this challenge, we propose MimicFunc, a framework that establishes
functional correspondences with function frame, a function-centric local
coordinate frame constructed with keypoint-based abstraction, for imitating
tool manipulation skills. Experiments demonstrate that MimicFunc effectively
enables the robot to generalize the skill from a single RGB-D human video to
manipulating novel tools for functionally equivalent tasks. Furthermore,
leveraging MimicFunc's one-shot generalization capability, the generated
rollouts can be used to train visuomotor policies without requiring
labor-intensive teleoperation data collection for novel objects. Our code and
video are available at https://sites.google.com/view/mimicfunc.

systematically evaluate five storage architectures (Graph Databases,
Multi-Model Databases, Data Lakes, Vector Databases, and Time-Series

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) exhibits great potential in designing of analog
integrated circuits (IC) because of its excellence in abstraction and
generalization for knowledge. However, further development of LLM-based analog
ICs heavily relies on textual description of analog ICs, while existing analog
ICs are mostly illustrated in image-based circuit diagrams rather than
text-based netlists. Converting circuit diagrams to netlists help LLMs to
enrich the knowledge of analog IC. Nevertheless, previously proposed conversion
frameworks face challenges in further application because of limited support of
image styles and circuit elements. Up to now, it still remains a challenging
task to effectively convert complex circuit diagrams into netlists. To this
end, this paper constructs and opensources a new dataset with rich styles of
circuit diagrams as well as balanced distribution of simple and complex analog
ICs. And a hybrid framework, named Image2Net, is proposed for practical
conversion from circuit diagrams to netlists. The netlist edit distance (NED)
is also introduced to precisely assess the difference between the converted
netlists and ground truth. Based on our benchmark, Image2Net achieves 80.77\%
successful rate, which is 34.62\%-45.19\% higher than previous works.
Specifically, the proposed work shows 0.116 averaged NED, which is
62.1\%-69.6\% lower than state-of-the-arts.

Abstract: The cochlear implant (CI) is a remarkable biomedical device that successfully
enables individuals with severe-to-profound hearing loss to perceive sound by
converting speech into electrical stimulation signals. Despite advancements in
the performance of recent CI systems, speech comprehension in noisy or
reverberant conditions remains a challenge. Recent and ongoing developments in
deep learning reveal promising opportunities for enhancing CI sound coding
capabilities, not only through replicating traditional signal processing
methods with neural networks, but also through integrating visual cues as
auxiliary data for multimodal speech processing. Therefore, this paper
introduces a novel noise-suppressing CI system, AVSE-ECS, which utilizes an
audio-visual speech enhancement (AVSE) model as a pre-processing module for the
deep-learning-based ElectrodeNet-CS (ECS) sound coding strategy. Specifically,
a joint training approach is applied to model AVSE-ECS, an end-to-end CI
system. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms the
previous ECS strategy in noisy conditions, with improved objective speech
intelligibility scores. The methods and findings in this study demonstrate the
feasibility and potential of using deep learning to integrate the AVSE module
into an end-to-end CI system

Motivation: 低轨道卫星网络(LSNs)为网络覆盖缺口区域提供了解决方案，但现有直播平台在LSNs上遇到频繁卫星切换导致的视频重缓冲问题，当前的适应码率算法无法有效处理这种突变的网络变化

Method: 提出SARA中间件，能够与各种ABR算法无缝集成；通过智能调节视频播放速度，并为ABR算法提供LSNs网络特征的洞察，帮助ABR算法做出更明智的码率选择

Result: 综合评估显示SARA能够平均减少39.41%的重缓冲时间，轻微提高0.65%的延迟，而仅导致0.13%的码率损失

Conclusion: SARA为在低轨道卫星网络上提供更畅顺的直播视频体验提供了有效解决方案，通过轻量级中间件设计有效缓解了卫星切换带来的网络波动问题

Abstract: Live streaming has experienced significant growth recently. Yet this rise in
popularity contrasts with the reality that a substantial segment of the global
population still lacks Internet access. The emergence of Low Earth orbit
Satellite Networks (LSNs), such as SpaceX's Starlink and Amazon's Project
Kuiper, presents a promising solution to fill this gap. Nevertheless, our
measurement study reveals that existing live streaming platforms may not be
able to deliver a smooth viewing experience on LSNs due to frequent satellite
handovers, which lead to frequent video rebuffering events. Current
state-of-the-art learning-based Adaptive Bitrate (ABR) algorithms, even when
trained on LSNs' network traces, fail to manage the abrupt network variations
associated with satellite handovers effectively. To address these challenges,
for the first time, we introduce Satellite-Aware Rate Adaptation (SARA), a
versatile and lightweight middleware that can seamlessly integrate with various
ABR algorithms to enhance the performance of live streaming over LSNs. SARA
intelligently modulates video playback speed and furnishes ABR algorithms with
insights derived from the distinctive network characteristics of LSNs, thereby
aiding ABR algorithms in making informed bitrate selections and effectively
minimizing rebuffering events that occur during satellite handovers. Our
extensive evaluation shows that SARA can effectively reduce the rebuffering

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了MM-BrowseComp评测标准，专门评估AI代理在多模态内容浏览中的检索和推理能力，发现当前最好模型也仅有29.02%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有浏览评测标准主要关注文本信息，忽视了网页中普遍存在的多模态内容（图片/视频），需要极强多模态检索和推理能力的评测工具。

Method: 构建了224个具有挑战性的手工制作问题，问题提示和浏览过程中都可能包含图片/视频信息，并为每个问题提供验证过的检查清单以分析多模态依赖性和推理路径。

Result: 对最先进模型的综合评估显示，包括OpenAI o3在内的最好模型也仅达到29.02%的准确率，显示当前模型在多模态能力上的不足和缺乏原生多模态推理能力。

Conclusion: MM-BrowseComp揭示了当前AI代理在多模态浏览任务中的显著短板，强调了发展原生多模态推理能力的重要性，为未来研究提供了一个具有挑战性的评测标准。

Abstract: AI agents with advanced reasoning and tool use capabilities have demonstrated
impressive performance in web browsing for deep search. While existing
benchmarks such as BrowseComp evaluate these browsing abilities, they primarily
focus on textual information, overlooking the prevalence of multimodal content.
To bridge this gap, we introduce MM-BrowseComp, a novel benchmark comprising
224 challenging, hand-crafted questions specifically designed to assess agents'
multimodal retrieval and reasoning capabilities. These questions often
incorporate images in prompts, and crucial information encountered during the
search and reasoning process may also be embedded within images or videos on
webpages. Consequently, methods relying solely on text prove insufficient for
our benchmark. Additionally, we provide a verified checklist for each question,
enabling fine-grained analysis of multimodal dependencies and reasoning paths.
Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models on MM-BrowseComp
reveals that even top models like OpenAI o3 with tools achieve only 29.02\%
accuracy, highlighting the suboptimal multimodal capabilities and lack of
native multimodal reasoning in current models.

*Jiacheng Ruan,Dan Jiang,Xian Gao,Ting Liu,Yuzhuo Fu,Yangyang Kang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MME-SCI是一个针对多模态大语言模型的多语言科学推理基准测试，覆盖数学、物理、化学、生物四大学科，支持五种语言，包含1019个高质量问答对，评估结果显示现有模型在该基准上表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有科学领域基准测试存在三个关键问题：多语言场景下推理能力评估不足、多模态覆盖不全面、科学知识点标注不够细粒度。

Method: 收集1019个高质量问答对，涵盖4个学科和5种语言，设计3种评估模式，对16个开源模型和4个闭源模型进行广泛实验。

Result: 模型表现普遍较差，如图像模式下o4-mini在数学、物理、化学、生物的准确率分别为52.11%、24.73%、36.57%、29.80%，难度显著高于现有基准。

Conclusion: MME-SCI是一个全面且具有挑战性的基准，能够深入分析模型在多语言科学推理方面的弱点，为模型改进提供重要参考。

Abstract: Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved significant
advancements across various domains, and corresponding evaluation benchmarks
have been continuously refined and improved. In this process, benchmarks in the
scientific domain have played an important role in assessing the reasoning
capabilities of MLLMs. However, existing benchmarks still face three key
challenges: 1) Insufficient evaluation of models' reasoning abilities in
multilingual scenarios; 2) Inadequate assessment of MLLMs' comprehensive
modality coverage; 3) Lack of fine-grained annotation of scientific knowledge
points. To address these gaps, we propose MME-SCI, a comprehensive and
challenging benchmark. We carefully collected 1,019 high-quality
question-answer pairs, which involve 3 distinct evaluation modes. These pairs
cover four subjects, namely mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology, and
support five languages: Chinese, English, French, Spanish, and Japanese. We
conducted extensive experiments on 16 open-source models and 4 closed-source
models, and the results demonstrate that MME-SCI is widely challenging for
existing MLLMs. For instance, under the Image-only evaluation mode, o4-mini
achieved accuracy of only 52.11%, 24.73%, 36.57%, and 29.80% in mathematics,
physics, chemistry, and biology, respectively, indicating a significantly
higher difficulty level compared to existing benchmarks. More importantly,
using MME-SCI's multilingual and fine-grained knowledge attributes, we analyzed
existing models' performance in depth and identified their weaknesses in
specific domains. The Data and Evaluation Code are available at
https://github.com/JCruan519/MME-SCI.

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: 提出了一种可微分的正向/逆向投影器框架，通过分析梯度公式实现高效、准确的梯度计算，在X射线成像任务中实现了8倍速度提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖自动微分或仅适用于特定投影器类型，需要一种通用、高效的可微分投影器框架来支持刚体运动估计任务

Method: 基于连续域中正向/逆向投影的一般分析梯度公式，发现梯度可以直接通过正向和逆向投影操作来表达，并开发了离散化实现和加速策略

Result: 在2D/3D注册中实现了8倍速度提升，在运动补偿分析重建和键形杖CT几何校准中提高了图像清晰度和结构保真度，显示出显著的效率优势

Conclusion: 该可微分投影器框架为需要刚体运动估计的X射线成像任务提供了高效、有效的基于梯度的解决方案

Abstract: Objective: In this work, we propose a framework for differentiable forward
and back-projector that enables scalable, accurate, and memory-efficient
gradient computation for rigid motion estimation tasks. Methods: Unlike
existing approaches that rely on auto-differentiation or that are restricted to
specific projector types, our method is based on a general analytical gradient
formulation for forward/backprojection in the continuous domain. A key insight
is that the gradients of both forward and back-projection can be expressed
directly in terms of the forward and back-projection operations themselves,
providing a unified gradient computation scheme across different projector
types. Leveraging this analytical formulation, we develop a discretized
implementation with an acceleration strategy that balances computational speed
and memory usage. Results: Simulation studies illustrate the numerical accuracy
and computational efficiency of the proposed algorithm. Experiments
demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach for multiple X-ray imaging
tasks we conducted. In 2D/3D registration, the proposed method achieves ~8x
speedup over an existing differentiable forward projector while maintaining
comparable accuracy. In motion-compensated analytical reconstruction and
cone-beam CT geometry calibration, the proposed method enhances image sharpness
and structural fidelity on real phantom data while showing significant
efficiency advantages over existing gradient-free and gradient-based solutions.
Conclusion: The proposed differentiable projectors enable effective and
efficient gradient-based solutions for X-ray imaging tasks requiring rigid
motion estimation.

*Lei Chen,Xuanle Zhao,Zhixiong Zeng,Jing Huang,Liming Zheng,Yufeng Zhong,Lin Ma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了多模态结构化强化学习(MSRL)方法，通过结合文本和视觉奖励机制，成功突破了监督微调在图表转代码任务中的性能瓶颈，在多个基准测试中取得了显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然强化学习在视觉语言模型中有效，但在需要深度理解信息丰富图像和生成结构化输出的任务中应用不足。图表转代码生成任务需要复杂的视觉推理，仅靠监督微调往往不够，需要有效的强化学习策略来适当奖励结构化输出。

Method: 提出多模态结构化强化学习(MSRL)，构建包含300万真实图表-代码对的最大训练语料库。采用多粒度结构化奖励系统：文本层面使用基于规则的奖励验证代码细节，视觉层面通过渲染生成代码为图像并使用评估模型评估结构相似性。采用两阶段课程学习确保训练稳定性。

Result: MSRL显著突破了SFT的性能瓶颈，在ChartMimic和ReachQA基准测试中分别将高级指标提升了6.2%和9.9%，达到了与先进闭源模型竞争的性能水平。

Conclusion: 多模态结构化强化学习方法通过结合文本和视觉反馈的有效奖励机制，成功解决了图表转代码生成中的性能瓶颈问题，为复杂视觉推理任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective for general
reasoning in vision-language models, its application to tasks requiring
in-depth understanding of information-rich images and generation of structured
outputs remains underexplored. Chart-to-code generation exemplifies this
challenge, demanding complex reasoning over visual charts to generate
structured code. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) alone is often insufficient,
highlighting the need for effective RL strategies that appropriately reward
structured outputs. We systematically investigate the performance plateau in
SFT through large-scale experiments and propose Multimodal Structured
Reinforcement Learning (MSRL) for chart-to-code generation, which substantially
breaks through this plateau. We construct the largest training corpus to date,
containing 3 million chart-code pairs from real-world arXiv tables to mitigate
simplistic patterns of prior synthetic data. Despite reaching state-of-the-art
performance, our experiments show that scaling SFT data eventually hits a
plateau where further increases yield negligible improvements. Our MSRL method
leverages a multi-granularity structured reward system using multimodal textual
and visual feedback. At the textual level, rule-based rewards validate
fine-grained code details. At the visual level, model-based rewards assess
structural similarity by rendering generated code into images and employing an
evaluator model. We implement this within a two-stage curriculum for training
stability. Results demonstrate that MSRL significantly breaks the SFT plateau,
improving high-level metrics by 6.2% and 9.9% on ChartMimic and ReachQA
benchmarks respectively, achieving competitive performance with advanced
closed-source models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BERT-VQA模型在图表视觉问答任务中表现不如预期，VisualBERT的跨模态模块对图表组件与问题短语的对齐并非必需，为图表问答挑战提供了重要架构见解


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图表视觉问答这一自然语言理解中的挑战性子任务，需要模型在视觉和语言域之间进行信息交换

Method: 开发了基于VisualBERT的BERT-VQA模型架构，使用预训练的ResNet 101图像编码器，并可能加入联合融合模块，与基于LSTM、CNN和浅层分类器的基线模型进行比较

Result: 最终结果推翻了核心假设，证明VisualBERT中的跨模态模块对于对齐图表组件和问题短语并非必需

Conclusion: 这项工作为图表问答挑战的难度以及不同模型架构在解决此问题时的适用性提供了有价值的见解

Abstract: Visual question answering has been an exciting challenge in the field of
natural language understanding, as it requires deep learning models to exchange
information from both vision and language domains. In this project, we aim to
tackle a subtask of this problem, namely visual question answering on plots. To
achieve this, we developed BERT-VQA, a VisualBERT-based model architecture with
a pretrained ResNet 101 image encoder, along with a potential addition of joint
fusion. We trained and evaluated this model against a baseline that consisted
of a LSTM, a CNN, and a shallow classifier. The final outcome disproved our
core hypothesis that the cross-modality module in VisualBERT is essential in
aligning plot components with question phrases. Therefore, our work provided
valuable insights into the difficulty of the plot question answering challenge
as well as the appropriateness of different model architectures in solving this
problem.

TL;DR: RISE是一个两阶段框架，通过强化学习生成视觉基础、逻辑一致的思维链(CoTs)，然后利用高质量CoT子集进行监督微调和强化微调，在复杂视觉任务中实现可解释推理和准确标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型(VLMs)在处理复杂图像标注任务时存在困难，标准监督微调只关注标注结果而忽略推理过程，视觉强化微调由于缺乏高质量验证的思维链而产生不一致的推理。

Method: 两阶段框架：1) Reason阶段(RISE-CoT)：通过强化学习的"标注-推理-标注"闭环生成视觉基础、逻辑一致的思维链；2) Inspire和Strengthen阶段(RISE-R1)：利用高质量CoT子集进行监督微调，然后强化微调。

Result: 在复杂和简单图像标注任务上，RISE训练的Qwen2-VL-2B模型优于标准监督微调和视觉强化微调，实现了鲁棒性能和增强的可解释性。

Conclusion: RISE提供了一种无需手动标注思维链的自监督解决方案，可显著提升视觉语言模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with complex image annotation tasks,
such as emotion classification and context-driven object detection, which
demand sophisticated reasoning. Standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) focuses
solely on annotation outcomes, ignoring underlying rationales, while Visual
Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (Visual-RFT) produces inconsistent Chains of Thought
(CoTs) due to the absence of high-quality, verified CoTs during pre-training.
We introduce RISE (Reason-Inspire-Strengthen-Expertise), a two-stage framework
to overcome these limitations. In the Reason stage (RISE-CoT), a reinforcement
learning-driven "annotation-reasoning-annotation" closed-loop generates
visually grounded, logically consistent CoTs by verifying their ability to
reconstruct original annotations without direct leakage. The Inspire and
Strengthen stage (RISE-R1) leverages a high-quality CoT subset, filtered by
RISE-CoT rewards, for supervised fine-tuning, followed by reinforcement
fine-tuning to produce interpretable reasoning and accurate annotations,
achieving Expertise in complex visual tasks. Evaluated on complex and simple
image annotation tasks, RISE-trained Qwen2-VL-2B outperforms SFT and
Visual-RFT, achieving robust performance and enhanced explainability. RISE
offers a self-supervised solution for advancing VLM reasoning without requiring
manually annotated CoTs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决层次多标签分类中保持结构一致性和平衡多任务学习中损失加权的关键挑战，传统方法存在"一强多弱"的优化偏差问题。

Method: 基于多任务学习框架，集成原型对比学习和自适应任务加权机制，通过显式建模标签语义一致性和特征聚合，并引入原型扰动机制增强鲁棒性。

Result: 在三个数据集上的大量实验表明，所提出的分类器相比基线模型具有更高的分类准确率和更低的结构违规率。

Conclusion: HCAL分类器通过语义一致性保持和自适应优化资源分配，有效解决了层次多标签分类中的结构一致性和损失平衡问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Hierarchical Multi-Label Classification (HMC) faces critical challenges in
maintaining structural consistency and balancing loss weighting in Multi-Task
Learning (MTL). In order to address these issues, we propose a classifier
called HCAL based on MTL integrated with prototype contrastive learning and
adaptive task-weighting mechanisms. The most significant advantage of our
classifier is semantic consistency including both prototype with explicitly
modeling label and feature aggregation from child classes to parent classes.
The other important advantage is an adaptive loss-weighting mechanism that
dynamically allocates optimization resources by monitoring task-specific
convergence rates. It effectively resolves the "one-strong-many-weak"
optimization bias inherent in traditional MTL approaches. To further enhance
robustness, a prototype perturbation mechanism is formulated by injecting
controlled noise into prototype to expand decision boundaries. Additionally, we
formalize a quantitative metric called Hierarchical Violation Rate (HVR) as to
evaluate hierarchical consistency and generalization. Extensive experiments
across three datasets demonstrate both the higher classification accuracy and
reduced hierarchical violation rate of the proposed classifier over baseline
models.

TL;DR: 重新评估生物识别模态通过24位专家调查，发现面部识别因技术进步而提升，指纹识别因漏洞而降低，专家评估与数据集结果高度一致


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的生物识别模态评估框架过时，无法反映最新技术进步和新兴漏洞，需要一个更可靠的评估框架来判断各种生物识别模态在具体应用中的适用性

Method: 通过调查24位生物识别专家，重新评估各种生物识别模态的属性评分，并将专家评估与55个生物识别数据集的统计不确定性进行对比分析

Result: 专家评分显示各模态属性评价出现显著变化：面部识别因技术进步而提升，指纹识别因漏洞攻击而可靠性降低，专家评估与数据集结果在大部分模态上强烈对齐

Conclusion: 专家见解与实证数据的结合对生物识别模态评估至关重要，专家分歧也揭示了关键的开放挑战，为未来研究提供了方向指引

Abstract: The rapid advancement of authentication systems and their increasing reliance
on biometrics for faster and more accurate user verification experience,
highlight the critical need for a reliable framework to evaluate the
suitability of biometric modalities for specific applications. Currently, the
most widely known evaluation framework is a comparative table from 1998, which
no longer adequately captures recent technological developments or emerging
vulnerabilities in biometric systems. To address these challenges, this work
revisits the evaluation of biometric modalities through an expert survey
involving 24 biometric specialists. The findings indicate substantial shifts in
property ratings across modalities. For example, face recognition, shows
improved ratings due to technological progress, while fingerprint, shows
decreased reliability because of emerging vulnerabilities and attacks. Further
analysis of expert agreement levels across rated properties highlighted the
consistency of the provided evaluations and ensured the reliability of the
ratings. Finally, expert assessments are compared with dataset-level
uncertainty across 55 biometric datasets, revealing strong alignment in most
modalities and underscoring the importance of integrating empirical evidence
with expert insight. Moreover, the identified expert disagreements reveal key
open challenges and help guide future research toward resolving them.

Motivation: 将成熟的雷达追踪技术应用于计算机视觉中的行人追踪问题，探索基于模型的算法在视觉追踪领域的应用潜力。

Method: 采用标准点对象(SPO)模型和泊松多伯努利混合(PMBM)滤波器，结合第一原理和数据驱动的方法选择模型参数，使用MOT-17公开数据集进行参数识别。

Result: PMBM算法显示出有希望的结果，但揭示了SPO模型与数据之间存在不匹配的问题。

Conclusion: 基于模型的方法表明，通过修正导致SPO模型与数据不匹配的问题组件，可以在未来开发出更好的基于模型的算法。

Abstract: This paper uses multi-object tracking methods known from the radar tracking
community to address the problem of pedestrian tracking using 2D bounding box
detections. The standard point-object (SPO) model is adopted, and the posterior
density is computed using the Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture (PMBM) filter.
The selection of the model parameters rooted in continuous time is discussed,
including the birth and survival probabilities. Some parameters are selected
from the first principles, while others are identified from the data, which is,
in this case, the publicly available MOT-17 dataset. Although the resulting
PMBM algorithm yields promising results, a mismatch between the SPO model and
the data is revealed. The model-based approach assumes that modifying the
problematic components causing the SPO model-data mismatch will lead to better
model-based algorithms in future developments.

TL;DR: 提出基于高斯混合模型的不确定性感知主成分分析方法，能够更好地处理非正态分布的多维数据降维投影


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多维数据的不确定性往往不能用正态分布很好地描述，需要一种能够处理任意概率密度函数的降维方法

Method: 使用高斯混合模型建模多维分布，从一般化公式推导投影方法，支持用户自定义权重

Result: 低维投影能展示更多分布细节，比UAPCA映射更忠实表示原始分布

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理非正态分布数据的降维，提供更准确的不确定性可视化

Abstract: Multidimensional data is often associated with uncertainties that are not
well-described by normal distributions. In this work, we describe how such
distributions can be projected to a low-dimensional space using
uncertainty-aware principal component analysis (UAPCA). We propose to model
multidimensional distributions using Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and derive
the projection from a general formulation that allows projecting arbitrary
probability density functions. The low-dimensional projections of the densities
exhibit more details about the distributions and represent them more faithfully
compared to UAPCA mappings. Further, we support including user-defined weights
between the different distributions, which allows for varying the importance of
the multidimensional distributions. We evaluate our approach by comparing the
distributions in low-dimensional space obtained by our method and UAPCA to
those obtained by sample-based projections.
