(QT) probability into neural network models effectively captures important
nuances of human perception, particularly in the recognition of ambiguous
objects and sentiment analysis. In this paper, we employ novel QT-based neural
networks and assess their effectiveness in distinguishing customised
CIFAR-format images of military and civilian vehicles, as well as sentiment,
using a proprietary military-specific vocabulary. We suggest that QT-based
models can enhance multimodal AI applications in battlefield scenarios,
particularly within human-operated drone warfare contexts, imbuing AI with
certain traits of human reasoning.

### [4] [Adapt, But Don't Forget: Fine-Tuning and Contrastive Routing for Lane Detection under Distribution Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18653)
*Mohammed Abdul Hafeez Khan,Parth Ganeriwala,Sarah M. Lehman,Siddhartha Bhattacharyya,Amy Alvarez,Natasha Neogi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种解决跨数据集分布偏移导致灾难性遗忘的方法，通过分支微调和动态路由实现参数高效适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有车道检测模型在封闭环境下训练和测试，跨数据集分布偏移会导致灾难性遗忘，需要一种参数高效的方法来适应新分布。

Method: 首先训练基础模型，然后为每个目标分布创建独立分支，仅微调部分组件，并通过对比学习模型动态路由输入。

Result: 框架在显著减少参数量的同时，实现了接近最优的F1分数。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了跨数据集适应问题，参数效率高，性能接近最优。

Abstract: Lane detection models are often evaluated in a closed-world setting, where
training and testing occur on the same dataset. We observe that, even within
the same domain, cross-dataset distribution shifts can cause severe
catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning. To address this, we first train a
base model on a source distribution and then adapt it to each new target
distribution by creating separate branches, fine-tuning only selected
components while keeping the original source branch fixed. Based on a
component-wise analysis, we identify effective fine-tuning strategies for
target distributions that enable parameter-efficient adaptation. At inference
time, we propose using a supervised contrastive learning model to identify the
input distribution and dynamically route it to the corresponding branch. Our
framework achieves near-optimal F1-scores while using significantly fewer
parameters than training separate models for each distribution.

### [5] [Part Segmentation of Human Meshes via Multi-View Human Parsing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18655)
*James Dickens,Kamyar Hamad*

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结合点云深度学习与人体解析领域，实现无需纹理信息的大规模人体网格语义分割。

Result: 实验验证了方法的有效性和准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了基于几何的人体网格语义分割，为相关领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in point cloud deep learning have led to models that achieve
high per-part labeling accuracy on large-scale point clouds, using only the raw
geometry of unordered point sets. In parallel, the field of human parsing
focuses on predicting body part and clothing/accessory labels from images. This
work aims to bridge these two domains by enabling per-vertex semantic
segmentation of large-scale human meshes. To achieve this, a pseudo-ground
truth labeling pipeline is developed for the Thuman2.1 dataset: meshes are
first aligned to a canonical pose, segmented from multiple viewpoints, and the
resulting point-level labels are then backprojected onto the original mesh to
produce per-point pseudo ground truth annotations. Subsequently, a novel,
memory-efficient sampling strategy is introduced, a windowed iterative farthest
point sampling (FPS) with space-filling curve-based serialization to
effectively downsample the point clouds. This is followed by a purely geometric
segmentation using PointTransformer, enabling semantic parsing of human meshes
without relying on texture information. Experimental results confirm the
effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approach.

### [6] [ShrinkBox: Backdoor Attack on Object Detection to Disrupt Collision Avoidance in Machine Learning-based Advanced Driver Assistance Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18656)
*Muhammad Zaeem Shahzad,Muhammad Abdullah Hanif,Bassem Ouni,Muhammad Shafique*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ShrinkBox的新型后门攻击方法，针对基于机器学习的ADAS中的物体检测功能，通过缩小边界框来干扰距离估计，攻击成功率高且隐蔽。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ADAS系统依赖昂贵传感器，而基于机器学习的ADAS（ML-ADAS）提供了一种低成本替代方案。然而，其物体检测功能存在安全漏洞，需要研究新型攻击方法以提高系统安全性。

Method: 提出ShrinkBox攻击方法，通过缩小地面真实边界框来干扰物体检测和距离估计。实验在YOLOv9m检测器和KITTI数据集上进行，验证攻击效果。

Result: 攻击成功率达96%，仅需4%的训练数据污染比例。下游距离估计的平均绝对误差（MAE）增加3倍以上，可能导致碰撞警告延迟或失效。

Conclusion: ShrinkBox攻击揭示了ML-ADAS中物体检测的安全隐患，强调了在系统设计中考虑安全性的重要性。

Abstract: Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) significantly enhance road safety
by detecting potential collisions and alerting drivers. However, their reliance
on expensive sensor technologies such as LiDAR and radar limits accessibility,
particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Machine learning-based ADAS
(ML-ADAS), leveraging deep neural networks (DNNs) with only standard camera
input, offers a cost-effective alternative. Critical to ML-ADAS is the
collision avoidance feature, which requires the ability to detect objects and
estimate their distances accurately. This is achieved with specialized DNNs
like YOLO, which provides real-time object detection, and a lightweight,
detection-wise distance estimation approach that relies on key features
extracted from the detections like bounding box dimensions and size. However,
the robustness of these systems is undermined by security vulnerabilities in
object detectors. In this paper, we introduce ShrinkBox, a novel backdoor
attack targeting object detection in collision avoidance ML-ADAS. Unlike
existing attacks that manipulate object class labels or presence, ShrinkBox
subtly shrinks ground truth bounding boxes. This attack remains undetected in
dataset inspections and standard benchmarks while severely disrupting
downstream distance estimation. We demonstrate that ShrinkBox can be realized
in the YOLOv9m object detector at an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 96%, with
only a 4% poisoning ratio in the training instances of the KITTI dataset.
Furthermore, given the low error targets introduced in our relaxed poisoning
strategy, we find that ShrinkBox increases the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) in
downstream distance estimation by more than 3x on poisoned samples, potentially
resulting in delays or prevention of collision warnings altogether.

### [7] [VGS-ATD: Robust Distributed Learning for Multi-Label Medical Image Classification Under Heterogeneous and Imbalanced Conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18657)
*Zehui Zhao,Laith Alzubaidi,Haider A. Alwzwazy,Jinglan Zhang,Yuantong Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为VGS-ATD的新型分布式学习框架，解决了传统集中式和去中心化学习在隐私、数据异构性和扩展性方面的不足，并在实验中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统集中式学习存在隐私风险，而去中心化方法如联邦学习和群体学习在处理异构数据、频繁通信和模型扩展时效率低下。临床环境的动态复杂性需要可扩展的AI系统。

Method: 提出VGS-ATD框架，通过分布式节点共享模型权重，避免数据集中化，同时优化通信和计算效率。

Result: 在30个数据集和80个独立标签的实验中，VGS-ATD准确率达92.7%，优于集中式学习（84.9%）和群体学习（72.99%），且扩展后准确率仅下降1%。

Conclusion: VGS-ATD在隐私保护、效率和扩展性方面表现优异，适用于动态复杂的临床环境。

Abstract: In recent years, advanced deep learning architectures have shown strong
performance in medical imaging tasks. However, the traditional centralized
learning paradigm poses serious privacy risks as all data is collected and
trained on a single server. To mitigate this challenge, decentralized
approaches such as federated learning and swarm learning have emerged, allowing
model training on local nodes while sharing only model weights. While these
methods enhance privacy, they struggle with heterogeneous and imbalanced data
and suffer from inefficiencies due to frequent communication and the
aggregation of weights. More critically, the dynamic and complex nature of
clinical environments demands scalable AI systems capable of continuously
learning from diverse modalities and multilabels. Yet, both centralized and
decentralized models are prone to catastrophic forgetting during system
expansion, often requiring full model retraining to incorporate new data. To
address these limitations, we propose VGS-ATD, a novel distributed learning
framework. To validate VGS-ATD, we evaluate it in experiments spanning 30
datasets and 80 independent labels across distributed nodes, VGS-ATD achieved
an overall accuracy of 92.7%, outperforming centralized learning (84.9%) and
swarm learning (72.99%), while federated learning failed under these conditions
due to high requirements on computational resources. VGS-ATD also demonstrated
strong scalability, with only a 1% drop in accuracy on existing nodes after
expansion, compared to a 20% drop in centralized learning, highlighting its
resilience to catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, it reduced computational
costs by up to 50% relative to both centralized and swarm learning, confirming
its superior efficiency and scalability.

### [8] [Structure Matters: Revisiting Boundary Refinement in Video Object Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18944)
*Guanyi Qin,Ziyue Wang,Daiyun Shen,Haofeng Liu,Hantao Zhou,Junde Wu,Runze Hu,Yueming Jin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为OASIS的半监督视频对象分割方法，通过边界修正和结构细化模块提升分割精度，并在遮挡区域引入不确定性估计，实现了高性能和实时处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有内存方法在遮挡场景和对象交互中表现不佳，且难以满足实时处理需求，因此需要一种更高效且鲁棒的方法。

Method: 提出轻量级结构细化模块，结合Canny滤波器的边缘先验和存储的对象特征生成结构图，并通过边界特征增强表示；引入证据学习处理遮挡区域。

Result: 在DAVIS-17和YouTubeVOS 2019验证集上分别达到F值91.6和G值86.6，推理速度为48 FPS。

Conclusion: OASIS在性能和速度上均优于现有方法，适用于实时应用。

Abstract: Given an object mask, Semi-supervised Video Object Segmentation (SVOS)
technique aims to track and segment the object across video frames, serving as
a fundamental task in computer vision. Although recent memory-based methods
demonstrate potential, they often struggle with scenes involving occlusion,
particularly in handling object interactions and high feature similarity. To
address these issues and meet the real-time processing requirements of
downstream applications, in this paper, we propose a novel bOundary Amendment
video object Segmentation method with Inherent Structure refinement, hereby
named OASIS. Specifically, a lightweight structure refinement module is
proposed to enhance segmentation accuracy. With the fusion of rough edge priors
captured by the Canny filter and stored object features, the module can
generate an object-level structure map and refine the representations by
highlighting boundary features. Evidential learning for uncertainty estimation
is introduced to further address challenges in occluded regions. The proposed
method, OASIS, maintains an efficient design, yet extensive experiments on
challenging benchmarks demonstrate its superior performance and competitive
inference speed compared to other state-of-the-art methods, i.e., achieving the
F values of 91.6 (vs. 89.7 on DAVIS-17 validation set) and G values of 86.6
(vs. 86.2 on YouTubeVOS 2019 validation set) while maintaining a competitive
speed of 48 FPS on DAVIS.

Abstract: Computer vision applications are omnipresent nowadays. The current paper
explores the use of fuzzy logic in computer vision, stressing its role in
handling uncertainty, noise, and imprecision in image data. Fuzzy logic is able
to model gradual transitions and human-like reasoning and provides a promising
approach to computer vision. Fuzzy approaches offer a way to improve object
recognition, image segmentation, and feature extraction by providing more
adaptable and interpretable solutions compared to traditional methods. We
discuss key fuzzy techniques, including fuzzy clustering, fuzzy inference
systems, type-2 fuzzy sets, and fuzzy rule-based decision-making. The paper
also discusses various applications, including medical imaging, autonomous
systems, and industrial inspection. Additionally, we explore the integration of
fuzzy logic with deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) to enhance performance in complex vision tasks. Finally, we examine
emerging trends such as hybrid fuzzy-deep learning models and explainable AI.

Motivation: 现有下一位置预测模型缺乏人类基于地图的推理能力，而VLM的视觉感知和推理能力为解决这一问题提供了新思路。

Method: 1. 提出VGLS方法评估通用VLM的轨迹推理能力；2. 设计VLMLocPredictor，包括两阶段：SFT任务和基于视觉地图反馈的强化学习。

Result: 在四个城市的数据集上实验表明，该方法达到SOTA性能，并优于其他基于LLM的方法。

Conclusion: 通过结合VLM的视觉推理能力，论文提出的方法在下一位置预测任务中表现出色，且具有跨城市泛化能力。

Abstract: Next Location Prediction is a fundamental task in the study of human
mobility, with wide-ranging applications in transportation planning, urban
governance, and epidemic forecasting. In practice, when humans attempt to
predict the next location in a trajectory, they often visualize the trajectory
on a map and reason based on road connectivity and movement trends. However,
the vast majority of existing next-location prediction models do not reason
over maps \textbf{in the way that humans do}. Fortunately, the recent
development of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has demonstrated strong
capabilities in visual perception and even visual reasoning. This opens up a
new possibility: by rendering both the road network and trajectory onto an
image and leveraging the reasoning abilities of VLMs, we can enable models to
perform trajectory inference in a human-like manner. To explore this idea, we
first propose a method called Vision-Guided Location Search (VGLS), which
evaluates whether a general-purpose VLM is capable of trajectory-based
reasoning without modifying any of its internal parameters. Based on insights
from the VGLS results, we further propose our main approach: VLMLocPredictor,
which is composed of two stages: In the first stage, we design two Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) tasks that help the VLM understand road network and
trajectory structures and acquire basic reasoning ability on such visual
inputs. In the second stage, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Visual
Map Feedback, enabling the model to self-improve its next-location prediction
ability through interaction with the environment. Experiments conducted on
datasets from four different cities show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and exhibits superior cross-city
generalization compared to other LLM-based approaches.

### [11] [Gen-AI Police Sketches with Stable Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18667)
*Nicholas Fidalgo,Aaron Contreras,Katherine Harvey,Johnny Ni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究通过多模态AI方法优化嫌疑人素描生成，比较了三种模型，发现基础模型（Model 1）在结构和感知质量上表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何利用多模态AI技术提升嫌疑人素描的自动化生成质量。

Method: 开发并评估了三种模型：基础Stable Diffusion模型、结合CLIP的模型，以及引入LoRA微调CLIP的新方法。

Result: Model 1在SSIM（0.72）和PSNR（25 dB）上表现最优，Model 3在LPIPS上有改进但不及Model 1。

Conclusion: 基础模型（Model 1）在素描生成中表现最稳健，尽管方法简单。

Abstract: This project investigates the use of multimodal AI-driven approaches to
automate and enhance suspect sketching. Three pipelines were developed and
evaluated: (1) baseline image-to-image Stable Diffusion model, (2) same model
integrated with a pre-trained CLIP model for text-image alignment, and (3)
novel approach incorporating LoRA fine-tuning of the CLIP model, applied to
self-attention and cross-attention layers, and integrated with Stable
Diffusion. An ablation study confirmed that fine-tuning both self- and
cross-attention layers yielded the best alignment between text descriptions and
sketches. Performance testing revealed that Model 1 achieved the highest
structural similarity (SSIM) of 0.72 and a peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of
25 dB, outperforming Model 2 and Model 3. Iterative refinement enhanced
perceptual similarity (LPIPS), with Model 3 showing improvement over Model 2
but still trailing Model 1. Qualitatively, sketches generated by Model 1
demonstrated the clearest facial features, highlighting its robustness as a
baseline despite its simplicity.

### [12] [Advancing Vision-based Human Action Recognition: Exploring Vision-Language CLIP Model for Generalisation in Domain-Independent Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18675)
*Sanyam Jain,Marsha Mariya Kappan,Vijeta Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了基于CLIP模型的人体动作识别在医疗领域的应用，分析了三种掩码策略对性能的影响，并提出了一种改进方法以提高分类准确性和减少偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型（如CNN和RNN）在复杂动作识别中泛化能力有限，而基于视觉-语言模型的CLIP显示出潜力，但其性能在医疗场景中仍需验证和改进。

Method: 在UCF-101数据集上评估CLIP，采用三种掩码策略（百分比/形状掩码、特征特定掩码和隔离掩码），并提出通过类特定噪声增强模型注意力。

Result: CLIP在视觉线索被遮挡时表现不稳定，改进方法提高了分类准确性和模型信心，同时减少了偏见。

Conclusion: CLIP在医疗领域的应用仍面临挑战，未来需进一步改进模型以提升跨领域泛化能力。

Abstract: Human action recognition plays a critical role in healthcare and medicine,
supporting applications such as patient behavior monitoring, fall detection,
surgical robot supervision, and procedural skill assessment. While traditional
models like CNNs and RNNs have achieved moderate success, they often struggle
to generalize across diverse and complex actions. Recent advancements in
vision-language models, especially the transformer-based CLIP model, offer
promising capabilities for generalizing action recognition from video data. In
this work, we evaluate CLIP on the UCF-101 dataset and systematically analyze
its performance under three masking strategies: (1) percentage-based and
shape-based black masking at 10%, 30%, and 50%, (2) feature-specific masking to
suppress bias-inducing elements, and (3) isolation masking that retains only
class-specific regions. Our results reveal that CLIP exhibits inconsistent
behavior and frequent misclassifications, particularly when essential visual
cues are obscured. To overcome these limitations, we propose incorporating
class-specific noise, learned via a custom loss function, to reinforce
attention to class-defining features. This enhancement improves classification
accuracy and model confidence while reducing bias. We conclude with a
discussion on the challenges of applying such models in clinical domains and
outline directions for future work to improve generalizability across
domain-independent healthcare scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HeartUnloadNet是一种深度学习框架，直接从舒张末期网格预测左心室的无负载形状，结合生物物理先验，显著提高了计算效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无负载心脏几何形状对个性化生物力学建模至关重要，但传统方法计算成本高且复杂。

Method: 采用图注意力架构和循环一致性策略，结合生理参数，实现双向预测，减少对大数据集的依赖。

Result: 在20,700次有限元模拟中，HeartUnloadNet达到亚毫米精度，推理时间仅0.02秒，比传统方法快10^5倍。

Conclusion: HeartUnloadNet为传统逆有限元求解器提供了可扩展且准确的替代方案，支持实时临床应用。

Abstract: The unloaded cardiac geometry (i.e., the state of the heart devoid of luminal
pressure) serves as a valuable zero-stress and zero-strain reference and is
critical for personalized biomechanical modeling of cardiac function, to
understand both healthy and diseased physiology and to predict the effects of
cardiac interventions. However, estimating the unloaded geometry from clinical
images remains a challenging task. Traditional approaches rely on inverse
finite element (FE) solvers that require iterative optimization and are
computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce HeartUnloadNet, a deep
learning framework that predicts the unloaded left ventricular (LV) shape
directly from the end diastolic (ED) mesh while explicitly incorporating
biophysical priors. The network accepts a mesh of arbitrary size along with
physiological parameters such as ED pressure, myocardial stiffness scale, and
fiber helix orientation, and outputs the corresponding unloaded mesh. It adopts
a graph attention architecture and employs a cycle-consistency strategy to
enable bidirectional (loading and unloading) prediction, allowing for partial
self-supervision that improves accuracy and reduces the need for large training
datasets. Trained and tested on 20,700 FE simulations across diverse LV
geometries and physiological conditions, HeartUnloadNet achieves sub-millimeter
accuracy, with an average DSC of 0.986 and HD of 0.083 cm, while reducing
inference time to just 0.02 seconds per case, over 10^5 times faster and
significantly more accurate than traditional inverse FE solvers. Ablation
studies confirm the effectiveness of the architecture. Notably, the
cycle-consistent design enables the model to maintain a DSC of 97% even with as
few as 200 training samples. This work thus presents a scalable and accurate
surrogate for inverse FE solvers, supporting real-time clinical applications in
the future.

Abstract: Spatial intelligence is emerging as a transformative frontier in AI, yet it
remains constrained by the scarcity of large-scale 3D datasets. Unlike the
abundant 2D imagery, acquiring 3D data typically requires specialized sensors
and laborious annotation. In this work, we present a scalable pipeline that
converts single-view images into comprehensive, scale- and appearance-realistic
3D representations - including point clouds, camera poses, depth maps, and
pseudo-RGBD - via integrated depth estimation, camera calibration, and scale
calibration. Our method bridges the gap between the vast repository of imagery
and the increasing demand for spatial scene understanding. By automatically
generating authentic, scale-aware 3D data from images, we significantly reduce
data collection costs and open new avenues for advancing spatial intelligence.
We release two generated spatial datasets, i.e., COCO-3D and Objects365-v2-3D,
and demonstrate through extensive experiments that our generated data can
benefit various 3D tasks, ranging from fundamental perception to MLLM-based
reasoning. These results validate our pipeline as an effective solution for
developing AI systems capable of perceiving, understanding, and interacting
with physical environments.

Motivation: 现有方法如NeRF和3DGS在训练和渲染速度、传感器兼容性及通用性方面存在局限，需要一种更高效且通用的解决方案。

Method: SaLF使用稀疏的3D体素基元表示体积，每个体素为局部隐式场，支持自适应修剪和密集化。

Conclusion: SaLF在保持真实感的同时提高了效率和功能，为自动驾驶传感器仿真提供了更可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: High-fidelity sensor simulation of light-based sensors such as cameras and
LiDARs is critical for safe and accurate autonomy testing. Neural radiance
field (NeRF)-based methods that reconstruct sensor observations via ray-casting
of implicit representations have demonstrated accurate simulation of driving
scenes, but are slow to train and render, hampering scale. 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated faster training and rendering times through
rasterization, but is primarily restricted to pinhole camera sensors,
preventing usage for realistic multi-sensor autonomy evaluation. Moreover, both
NeRF and 3DGS couple the representation with the rendering procedure (implicit
networks for ray-based evaluation, particles for rasterization), preventing
interoperability, which is key for general usage. In this work, we present
Sparse Local Fields (SaLF), a novel volumetric representation that supports
rasterization and raytracing. SaLF represents volumes as a sparse set of 3D
voxel primitives, where each voxel is a local implicit field. SaLF has fast
training (<30 min) and rendering capabilities (50+ FPS for camera and 600+ FPS
LiDAR), has adaptive pruning and densification to easily handle large scenes,
and can support non-pinhole cameras and spinning LiDARs. We demonstrate that
SaLF has similar realism as existing self-driving sensor simulation methods
while improving efficiency and enhancing capabilities, enabling more scalable
simulation. https://waabi.ai/salf/

Abstract: Optical Music Recognition (OMR) for historical Chinese musical notations,
such as suzipu and l\"ul\"upu, presents unique challenges due to high class
imbalance and limited training data. This paper introduces significant
advancements in OMR for Jiang Kui's influential collection Baishidaoren Gequ
from 1202. In this work, we develop and evaluate a character recognition model
for scarce imbalanced data. We improve upon previous baselines by reducing the
Character Error Rate (CER) from 10.4% to 7.1% for suzipu, despite working with
77 highly imbalanced classes, and achieve a remarkable CER of 0.9% for
l\"ul\"upu. Our models outperform human transcribers, with an average human CER
of 15.9% and a best-case CER of 7.6%. We employ temperature scaling to achieve
a well-calibrated model with an Expected Calibration Error (ECE) below 0.0162.
Using a leave-one-edition-out cross-validation approach, we ensure robust
performance across five historical editions. Additionally, we extend the
KuiSCIMA dataset to include all 109 pieces from Baishidaoren Gequ, encompassing
suzipu, l\"ul\"upu, and jianzipu notations. Our findings advance the
digitization and accessibility of historical Chinese music, promoting cultural
diversity in OMR and expanding its applicability to underrepresented music
traditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR图像缺乏大规模高质量图像-文本数据集，阻碍了其语义理解，因此需要构建SAR-Text数据集。

Method: 设计SAR-Narrator框架，采用多阶段渐进式迁移学习策略生成SAR图像的文本描述。

Result: 在图像-文本检索、图像描述和视觉问答任务中，SAR-RS-CLIP、SAR-RS-CoCa和SAR-GPT模型表现显著优于基线。

Conclusion: SAR-Text数据集和SAR-Narrator工具为SAR图像的语义理解提供了有效支持，并具有扩展潜力。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in the
field of remote sensing in recent years. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
imagery, with its all-weather capability, is essential in remote sensing, yet
the lack of large-scale, high-quality SAR image-text datasets hinders its
semantic understanding. In this paper, we construct SAR-Text, a large-scale and
high-quality dataset consisting of over 130,000 SAR image-text pairs. To
construct the SAR-Text dataset, we design the SAR-Narrator framework, which
generates textual descriptions for SAR images through a multi-stage progressive
transfer learning strategy. To verify the effectiveness of the SAR-TEXT
dataset, we conduct experiments on three typical vision-language tasks:
image-text retrieval, image captioning, and visual question answering (VQA).
Specifically, we construct three representative models on SAR-TEXT:
SAR-RS-CLIP, SAR-RS-CoCa, and SAR-GPT. SAR-RS-CLIP achieves notable
improvements in retrieval performance, boosting average recall by 16.43% and
10.54% on the OSdataset-512 and HRSID test sets, respectively. In the
captioning task, SAR-RS-CoCa achieves BLEU-4, SPICE, and CIDEr scores exceeding
those of the original CoCa model by more than 8x, 4x, and 10x, respectively. In
the VQA task, SAR-GPT outperforms baseline and single-stage models on multiple
SAR-VQA datasets, demonstrating stronger semantic understanding and reasoning
ability, as further confirmed by qualitative results. It is worth noting that,
as a flexible captioning tool, SAR-Narrator can be readily adopted by the
community to construct larger-scale SAR image-text datasets.

Conclusion: Human Gaussian Graph通过建模Gaussians与网格的关系，提升了动画化人体表示的效果。

Abstract: Modeling animatable human avatars from videos is a long-standing and
challenging problem. While conventional methods require per-instance
optimization, recent feed-forward methods have been proposed to generate 3D
Gaussians with a learnable network. However, these methods predict Gaussians
for each frame independently, without fully capturing the relations of
Gaussians from different timestamps. To address this, we propose Human Gaussian
Graph to model the connection between predicted Gaussians and human SMPL mesh,
so that we can leverage information from all frames to recover an animatable
human representation. Specifically, the Human Gaussian Graph contains dual
layers where Gaussians are the first layer nodes and mesh vertices serve as the
second layer nodes. Based on this structure, we further propose the intra-node
operation to aggregate various Gaussians connected to one mesh vertex, and
inter-node operation to support message passing among mesh node neighbors.
Experimental results on novel view synthesis and novel pose animation
demonstrate the efficiency and generalization of our method.

Conclusion: 提出的方法无需BEV表示，通过图像感知任务实现了高效且可解释的自由空间走廊预测。

Abstract: Drivable Free-space prediction is a fundamental and crucial problem in
autonomous driving. Recent works have addressed the problem by representing the
entire non-obstacle road regions as the free-space. In contrast our aim is to
estimate the driving corridors that are a navigable subset of the entire road
region. Unfortunately, existing corridor estimation methods directly assume a
BEV-centric representation, which is hard to obtain. In contrast, we frame
drivable free-space corridor prediction as a pure image perception task, using
only monocular camera input. However such a formulation poses several
challenges as one doesn't have the corresponding data for such free-space
corridor segments in the image. Consequently, we develop a novel
self-supervised approach for free-space sample generation by leveraging future
ego trajectories and front-view camera images, making the process of visual
corridor estimation dependent on the ego trajectory. We then employ a diffusion
process to model the distribution of such segments in the image. However, the
existing binary mask-based representation for a segment poses many limitations.
Therefore, we introduce ContourDiff, a specialized diffusion-based architecture
that denoises over contour points rather than relying on binary mask
representations, enabling structured and interpretable free-space predictions.
We evaluate our approach qualitatively and quantitatively on both nuScenes and
CARLA, demonstrating its effectiveness in accurately predicting safe multimodal
navigable corridors in the image.

Abstract: Image captioning, a task at the confluence of computer vision and natural
language processing, requires a sophisticated understanding of both visual
scenes and linguistic structure. While modern approaches are dominated by
large-scale Transformer architectures, this paper documents a systematic,
iterative development of foundational image captioning models, progressing from
a simple CNN-LSTM encoder-decoder to a competitive attention-based system. We
present a series of five models, beginning with Genesis and concluding with
Nexus, an advanced model featuring an EfficientNetV2B3 backbone and a dynamic
attention mechanism. Our experiments chart the impact of architectural
enhancements and demonstrate a key finding within the classic CNN-LSTM
paradigm: merely upgrading the visual backbone without a corresponding
attention mechanism can degrade performance, as the single-vector bottleneck
cannot transmit the richer visual detail. This insight validates the
architectural shift to attention. Trained on the MS COCO 2017 dataset, our
final model, Nexus, achieves a BLEU-4 score of 31.4, surpassing several
foundational benchmarks and validating our iterative design process. This work
provides a clear, replicable blueprint for understanding the core architectural
principles that underpin modern vision-language tasks.

Motivation: 随着深度伪造技术的发展，区分真实与伪造媒体变得更具挑战性，现有方法多依赖直接图像处理，而本文探索了一种基于面部关键点的替代方案。

Method: 使用包含真实和伪造视频的数据集，提取面部关键点，通过识别面部运动的不一致性进行检测，并在RNN、ANN和CNN模型中进行测试。

Conclusion: 该方法挑战了直接图像处理的必要性，展示了基于面部关键点的检测在多种神经网络模型中的潜力，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: The rise of deepfake technology brings forth new questions about the
authenticity of various forms of media found online today. Videos and images
generated by artificial intelligence (AI) have become increasingly more
difficult to differentiate from genuine media, resulting in the need for new
models to detect artificially-generated media. While many models have attempted
to solve this, most focus on direct image processing, adapting a convolutional
neural network (CNN) or a recurrent neural network (RNN) that directly
interacts with the video image data. This paper introduces an approach of using
solely facial landmarks for deepfake detection. Using a dataset consisting of
both deepfake and genuine videos of human faces, this paper describes an
approach for extracting facial landmarks for deepfake detection, focusing on
identifying subtle inconsistencies in facial movements instead of raw image
processing. Experimental results demonstrated that this feature extraction
technique is effective in various neural network models, with the same facial
landmarks tested on three neural network models, with promising performance
metrics indicating its potential for real-world applications. The findings
discussed in this paper include RNN and artificial neural network (ANN) models
with accuracy between 96% and 93%, respectively, with a CNN model hovering
around 78%. This research challenges the assumption that raw image processing
is necessary to identify deepfake videos by presenting a facial feature
extraction approach compatible with various neural network models while
requiring fewer parameters.

Abstract: We introduce the Flow Stochastic Segmentation Network (Flow-SSN), a

modern continuous-time flow variants. We prove fundamental limitations of the
low-rank parameterisation of previous methods and show that Flow-SSNs can
estimate arbitrarily high-rank pixel-wise covariances without assuming the rank
or storing the distributional parameters. Flow-SSNs are also more efficient to
sample from than standard diffusion-based segmentation models, thanks to most
of the model capacity being allocated to learning the base distribution of the
flow, constituting an expressive prior. We apply Flow-SSNs to challenging
medical imaging benchmarks and achieve state-of-the-art results. Code

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has advanced WSI analysis but struggles with
the complexity and heterogeneity of WSIs. Existing MIL methods face challenges
in aggregating diverse patch information into robust WSI representations. While
ViTs and clustering-based approaches show promise, they are computationally
intensive and fail to capture task-specific and slide-specific variability. To
address these limitations, we propose PTCMIL, a novel Prompt Token
Clustering-based ViT for MIL aggregation. By introducing learnable prompt
tokens into the ViT backbone, PTCMIL unifies clustering and prediction tasks in
an end-to-end manner. It dynamically aligns clustering with downstream tasks,
using projection-based clustering tailored to each WSI, reducing complexity
while preserving patch heterogeneity. Through token merging and prototype-based
pooling, PTCMIL efficiently captures task-relevant patterns. Extensive
experiments on eight datasets demonstrate its superior performance in
classification and survival analysis tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods. Systematic ablation studies confirm its robustness and strong
interpretability. The code is released at https://github.com/ubc-tea/PTCMIL.

Motivation: 解决现有视觉自动语音识别方法因音素视觉模糊性导致的高错误率问题，并减少对大量预训练数据的依赖。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：第一阶段通过V-ASR预测音素，结合面部特征；第二阶段使用LLM模型NLLB将音素重建为单词。

Result: 在LRS2和LRS3数据集上分别实现了17.4%和21.0%的词错误率（WER）。

Conclusion: PV-ASR方法通过音素预测和LLM重建，显著提高了视觉自动语音识别的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Visual Automatic Speech Recognition (V-ASR) is a challenging task that
involves interpreting spoken language solely from visual information, such as
lip movements and facial expressions. This task is notably challenging due to
the absence of auditory cues and the visual ambiguity of phonemes that exhibit
similar visemes-distinct sounds that appear identical in lip motions. Existing
methods often aim to predict words or characters directly from visual cues, but
they commonly suffer from high error rates due to viseme ambiguity and require
large amounts of pre-training data. We propose a novel phoneme-based two-stage
framework that fuses visual and landmark motion features, followed by an LLM
model for word reconstruction to address these challenges. Stage 1 consists of
V-ASR, which outputs the predicted phonemes, thereby reducing training
complexity. Meanwhile, the facial landmark features address speaker-specific
facial characteristics. Stage 2 comprises an encoder-decoder LLM model, NLLB,
that reconstructs the output phonemes back to words. Besides using a large
visual dataset for deep learning fine-tuning, our PV-ASR method demonstrates
superior performance by achieving 17.4% WER on the LRS2 and 21.0% WER on the
LRS3 dataset.

Abstract: Studying adversarial attacks on point clouds is essential for evaluating and
improving the robustness of 3D deep learning models. However, most existing
attack methods are developed under ideal white-box settings and often suffer
from limited transferability to unseen models and insufficient robustness
against common defense mechanisms. In this paper, we propose MAT-Adv, a novel
adversarial attack framework that enhances both transferability and
undefendability by explicitly perturbing the medial axis transform (MAT)
representations, in order to induce inherent adversarialness in the resulting
point clouds. Specifically, we employ an autoencoder to project input point
clouds into compact MAT representations that capture the intrinsic geometric
structure of point clouds. By perturbing these intrinsic representations,
MAT-Adv introduces structural-level adversarial characteristics that remain
effective across diverse models and defense strategies. To mitigate overfitting
and prevent perturbation collapse, we incorporate a dropout strategy into the
optimization of MAT perturbations, further improving transferability and
undefendability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAT-Adv significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both transferability and
undefendability. Codes will be made public upon paper acceptance.

Conclusion: 通过3D几何先验的引入，有效解决了模态差异问题，提升了平面图定位的性能。

Abstract: Since a building's floorplans are easily accessible, consistent over time,
and inherently robust to changes in visual appearance, self-localization within
the floorplan has attracted researchers' interest. However, since floorplans
are minimalist representations of a building's structure, modal and geometric
differences between visual perceptions and floorplans pose challenges to this
task. While existing methods cleverly utilize 2D geometric features and pose
filters to achieve promising performance, they fail to address the localization
errors caused by frequent visual changes and view occlusions due to variously
shaped 3D objects. To tackle these issues, this paper views the 2D Floorplan
Localization (FLoc) problem from a higher dimension by injecting 3D geometric
priors into the visual FLoc algorithm. For the 3D geometric prior modeling, we
first model geometrically aware view invariance using multi-view constraints,
i.e., leveraging imaging geometric principles to provide matching constraints
between multiple images that see the same points. Then, we further model the
view-scene aligned geometric priors, enhancing the cross-modal geometry-color
correspondences by associating the scene's surface reconstruction with the RGB
frames of the sequence. Both 3D priors are modeled through self-supervised
contrastive learning, thus no additional geometric or semantic annotations are
required. These 3D priors summarized in extensive realistic scenes bridge the
modal gap while improving localization success without increasing the
computational burden on the FLoc algorithm. Sufficient comparative studies
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
and substantially boosts the FLoc accuracy. All data and code will be released
after the anonymous review.

Motivation: 由于收集和标注成本高，伪装目标检测（COD）的数据集较少，尤其是某些特定类别。合成数据可以缓解数据不足问题，但直接使用会导致模型性能下降。

Method: 提出了基于师生模型的循环域适应框架（CSRDA），通过伪标签和一致性正则化将类别信息从标记的源域传播到未标记的目标域，并利用循环学习框架缩小域内差距。

Result: 实验表明，CSRDA框架有效缓解了COD中数据不足和手工标注的问题。

Conclusion: CSRDA框架在合成到真实的伪装目标检测任务中表现优异，为解决数据不足问题提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Due to the high cost of collection and labeling, there are relatively few
datasets for camouflaged object detection (COD). In particular, for certain
specialized categories, the available image dataset is insufficiently
populated. Synthetic datasets can be utilized to alleviate the problem of
limited data to some extent. However, directly training with synthetic datasets
compared to real datasets can lead to a degradation in model performance. To
tackle this problem, in this work, we investigate a new task, namely
Syn-to-Real Camouflaged Object Detection (S2R-COD). In order to improve the
model performance in real world scenarios, a set of annotated synthetic
camouflaged images and a limited number of unannotated real images must be
utilized. We propose the Cycling Syn-to-Real Domain Adaptation Framework
(CSRDA), a method based on the student-teacher model. Specially, CSRDA
propagates class information from the labeled source domain to the unlabeled
target domain through pseudo labeling combined with consistency regularization.
Considering that narrowing the intra-domain gap can improve the quality of
pseudo labeling, CSRDA utilizes a recurrent learning framework to build an
evolving real domain for bridging the source and target domain. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, mitigating the
problem of limited data and handcraft annotations in COD. Our code is publicly

Abstract: Video Object Segmentation (VOS) is foundational to numerous computer vision
applications, including surveillance, autonomous driving, robotics and
generative video editing. However, existing VOS models often struggle with
precise mask delineation, deformable objects, topologically transforming
objects, tracking drift and long video sequences. In this paper, we introduce
HQ-SMem, for High Quality video segmentation and tracking using Smart Memory, a
novel method that enhances the performance of VOS base models by addressing
these limitations. Our approach incorporates three key innovations: (i)
leveraging SAM with High-Quality masks (SAM-HQ) alongside appearance-based
candidate-selection to refine coarse segmentation masks, resulting in improved
object boundaries; (ii) implementing a dynamic smart memory mechanism that
selectively stores relevant key frames while discarding redundant ones, thereby
optimizing memory usage and processing efficiency for long-term videos; and
(iii) dynamically updating the appearance model to effectively handle complex
topological object variations and reduce drift throughout the video. These
contributions mitigate several limitations of existing VOS models including,
coarse segmentations that mix-in background pixels, fixed memory update
schedules, brittleness to drift and occlusions, and prompt ambiguity issues
associated with SAM. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple public
datasets and state-of-the-art base trackers demonstrate that our method
consistently ranks among the top two on VOTS and VOTSt 2024 datasets. Moreover,
HQ-SMem sets new benchmarks on Long Video Dataset and LVOS, showcasing its
effectiveness in challenging scenarios characterized by complex multi-object

*Zhentao Huang,Di Wu,Zhenbang He,Minglun Gong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GSSR是一种改进的3D高斯分布方法，通过均匀分布高斯点并优化几何对齐，显著提升场景几何精度和编辑能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D高斯分布方法（如3DGS和PGSR）在几何重建和编辑方面存在不足，高斯点分布不均匀且偏离潜在表面。

Method: GSSR结合单视角和多视角一致性优化，引入不透明度正则化和周期性高斯重新初始化，实现均匀分布和几何对齐。

Result: 实验证明GSSR显著提高了几何精度，同时保持了高质量的渲染性能。

Conclusion: GSSR为高斯分布方法提供了更精确的几何重建和更直观的场景编辑能力。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) effectively synthesizes novel views through its
flexible representation, yet fails to accurately reconstruct scene geometry.
While modern variants like PGSR introduce additional losses to ensure proper
depth and normal maps through Gaussian fusion, they still neglect individual
placement optimization. This results in unevenly distributed Gaussians that
deviate from the latent surface, complicating both reconstruction refinement
and scene editing. Motivated by pioneering work on Point Set Surfaces, we
propose Gaussian Set Surface Reconstruction (GSSR), a method designed to
distribute Gaussians evenly along the latent surface while aligning their
dominant normals with the surface normal. GSSR enforces fine-grained geometric
alignment through a combination of pixel-level and Gaussian-level single-view
normal consistency and multi-view photometric consistency, optimizing both
local and global perspectives. To further refine the representation, we
introduce an opacity regularization loss to eliminate redundant Gaussians and
apply periodic depth- and normal-guided Gaussian reinitialization for a
cleaner, more uniform spatial distribution. Our reconstruction results
demonstrate significantly improved geometric precision in Gaussian placement,
enabling intuitive scene editing and efficient generation of novel
Gaussian-based 3D environments. Extensive experiments validate GSSR's
effectiveness, showing enhanced geometric accuracy while preserving
high-quality rendering performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的跨模态目标检测方法WiSE-OD，通过结合RGB和红外模型的权重提升鲁棒性，并引入了两个新的OOD基准数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红外图像目标检测在低光和夜间应用中至关重要，但缺乏大规模数据集导致模型依赖RGB预训练权重，而微调后鲁棒性不足。

Method: 提出了WiSE-OD方法，通过权重空间集成结合RGB零样本和红外微调权重，并引入了LLVIP-C和FLIR-C两个跨模态OOD基准数据集。

Result: WiSE-OD在不增加训练或推理成本的情况下，显著提升了跨模态和抗干扰鲁棒性。

Conclusion: WiSE-OD方法有效解决了红外目标检测中的鲁棒性问题，为跨模态任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Object detection (OD) in infrared (IR) imagery is critical for low-light and
nighttime applications. However, the scarcity of large-scale IR datasets forces
models to rely on weights pre-trained on RGB images. While fine-tuning on IR
improves accuracy, it often compromises robustness under distribution shifts
due to the inherent modality gap between RGB and IR. To address this, we
introduce LLVIP-C and FLIR-C, two cross-modality out-of-distribution (OOD)
benchmarks built by applying corruption to standard IR datasets. Additionally,
to fully leverage the complementary knowledge from RGB and infrared trained
models, we propose WiSE-OD, a weight-space ensembling method with two variants:
WiSE-OD$_{ZS}$, which combines RGB zero-shot and IR fine-tuned weights, and
WiSE-OD$_{LP}$, which blends zero-shot and linear probing. Evaluated across
three RGB-pretrained detectors and two robust baselines, WiSE-OD improves both
cross-modality and corruption robustness without any additional training or
inference cost.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多粒度层次融合变换器（MGHFT），通过多视角贴图解释器和多模态大语言模型，提升贴图情感理解的准确性和细粒度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预训练视觉模型在贴图情感理解上表现不足，因其依赖多视角信息（如背景知识和风格线索）。

Method: 使用多模态大语言模型生成多视角文本描述，设计层次融合策略，结合金字塔视觉变换器提取全局和局部特征，并通过对比学习和注意力机制融合文本与视觉特征。

Result: 在两个公开数据集上显著优于现有方法，F1提升5.4%，准确率提升4.0%。

Conclusion: MGHFT通过多视角文本引导的视觉语义融合，有效提升了贴图情感理解的性能。

Abstract: Although pre-trained visual models with text have demonstrated strong
capabilities in visual feature extraction, sticker emotion understanding
remains challenging due to its reliance on multi-view information, such as
background knowledge and stylistic cues. To address this, we propose a novel
multi-granularity hierarchical fusion transformer (MGHFT), with a multi-view
sticker interpreter based on Multimodal Large Language Models. Specifically,
inspired by the human ability to interpret sticker emotions from multiple
views, we first use Multimodal Large Language Models to interpret stickers by
providing rich textual context via multi-view descriptions. Then, we design a
hierarchical fusion strategy to fuse the textual context into visual
understanding, which builds upon a pyramid visual transformer to extract both
global and local sticker features at multiple stages. Through contrastive
learning and attention mechanisms, textual features are injected at different
stages of the visual backbone, enhancing the fusion of global- and
local-granularity visual semantics with textual guidance. Finally, we introduce
a text-guided fusion attention mechanism to effectively integrate the overall
multimodal features, enhancing semantic understanding. Extensive experiments on
2 public sticker emotion datasets demonstrate that MGHFT significantly
outperforms existing sticker emotion recognition approaches, achieving higher
accuracy and more fine-grained emotion recognition. Compared to the best
pre-trained visual models, our MGHFT also obtains an obvious improvement, 5.4%
on F1 and 4.0% on accuracy. The code is released at

TL;DR: PDT是一种基于扩散模型的新型点分布转换框架，能够将无序点云转换为语义上有意义的结构化分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决如何从无序点云中提取有意义的结构信息并转换为语义上有意义的点分布这一未充分探索的问题。

Method: 利用扩散模型的新架构和学习策略，通过去噪过程关联源分布和目标分布。

Result: 成功将输入点云转换为多种结构化输出（如表面对齐关键点、内部稀疏关节和连续特征线）。

Conclusion: PDT能够捕捉几何和语义特征，为需要结构化点分布的3D几何处理任务提供了强大工具。

Abstract: Point-based representations have consistently played a vital role in
geometric data structures. Most point cloud learning and processing methods
typically leverage the unordered and unconstrained nature to represent the
underlying geometry of 3D shapes. However, how to extract meaningful structural
information from unstructured point cloud distributions and transform them into
semantically meaningful point distributions remains an under-explored problem.
We present PDT, a novel framework for point distribution transformation with
diffusion models. Given a set of input points, PDT learns to transform the
point set from its original geometric distribution into a target distribution
that is semantically meaningful. Our method utilizes diffusion models with
novel architecture and learning strategy, which effectively correlates the
source and the target distribution through a denoising process. Through
extensive experiments, we show that our method successfully transforms input
point clouds into various forms of structured outputs - ranging from
surface-aligned keypoints, and inner sparse joints to continuous feature lines.
The results showcase our framework's ability to capture both geometric and
semantic features, offering a powerful tool for various 3D geometry processing
tasks where structured point distributions are desired. Code will be available

Result: 实验表明PerioDet在自动检测根尖周炎方面表现优越，且人机协作实验验证了其临床实用性。

Conclusion: PerioXrays数据集和PerioDet方法为根尖周炎的自动诊断提供了重要工具，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Apical periodontitis is a prevalent oral pathology that presents significant
public health challenges. Despite advances in automated diagnostic systems
across various medical fields, the development of Computer-Aided Diagnosis
(CAD) applications for apical periodontitis is still constrained by the lack of
a large-scale, high-quality annotated dataset. To address this issue, we
release a large-scale panoramic radiograph benchmark called "PerioXrays",
comprising 3,673 images and 5,662 meticulously annotated instances of apical
periodontitis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first benchmark
dataset for automated apical periodontitis diagnosis. This paper further
proposes a clinical-oriented apical periodontitis detection (PerioDet)
paradigm, which jointly incorporates Background-Denoising Attention (BDA) and
IoU-Dynamic Calibration (IDC) mechanisms to address the challenges posed by
background noise and small targets in automated detection. Extensive
experiments on the PerioXrays dataset demonstrate the superiority of PerioDet
in advancing automated apical periodontitis detection. Additionally, a
well-designed human-computer collaborative experiment underscores the clinical
applicability of our method as an auxiliary diagnostic tool for professional
dentists.

Motivation: 准确识别车辆属性（如品牌、颜色和形状）对执法和情报应用至关重要。

Method: 研究使用包含10万张以上图像的数据集，测试了三种模型在不同任务（品牌、形状和颜色识别）中的表现，并采用MVI提升性能。

Result: 最佳模型在品牌、形状、颜色和颜色二分类任务中的准确率分别为93.70%、82.86%、85.19%和94.86%。

Conclusion: MVI是处理复杂真实世界数据的关键，且较小YOLO变体在效率上更具优势，适合实时预测。

Abstract: Accurate identification of vehicle attributes such as make, colour, and shape
is critical for law enforcement and intelligence applications. This study
evaluates the effectiveness of three state-of-the-art deep learning approaches
YOLO-v11, YOLO-World, and YOLO-Classification on a real-world vehicle image
dataset. This dataset was collected under challenging and unconstrained
conditions by NSW Police Highway Patrol Vehicles. A multi-view inference (MVI)
approach was deployed to enhance the performance of the models' predictions. To
conduct the analyses, datasets with 100,000 plus images were created for each
of the three metadata prediction tasks, specifically make, shape and colour.
The models were tested on a separate dataset with 29,937 images belonging to
1809 number plates. Different sets of experiments have been investigated by
varying the models sizes. A classification accuracy of 93.70%, 82.86%, 85.19%,
and 94.86% was achieved with the best performing make, shape, colour, and
colour-binary models respectively. It was concluded that there is a need to use
MVI to get usable models within such complex real-world datasets. Our findings
indicated that the object detection models YOLO-v11 and YOLO-World outperformed
classification-only models in make and shape extraction. Moreover, smaller YOLO
variants perform comparably to larger counterparts, offering substantial
efficiency benefits for real-time predictions. This work provides a robust
baseline for extracting vehicle metadata in real-world scenarios. Such models
can be used in filtering and sorting user queries, minimising the time required
to search large vehicle images datasets.

Conclusion: YOLOv8是水下污染检测和清理的有效工具。

Abstract: Underwater pollution is one of today's most significant environmental
concerns, with vast volumes of garbage found in seas, rivers, and landscapes
around the world. Accurate detection of these waste materials is crucial for
successful waste management, environmental monitoring, and mitigation
strategies. In this study, we investigated the performance of five cutting-edge
object recognition algorithms, namely YOLO (You Only Look Once) models,
including YOLOv7, YOLOv8, YOLOv9, YOLOv10, and Faster Region-Convolutional
Neural Network (R-CNN), to identify which model was most effective at
recognizing materials in underwater situations. The models were thoroughly
trained and tested on a large dataset containing fifteen different classes
under diverse conditions, such as low visibility and variable depths. From the
above-mentioned models, YOLOv8 outperformed the others, with a mean Average
Precision (mAP) of 80.9%, indicating a significant performance. This increased
performance is attributed to YOLOv8's architecture, which incorporates advanced
features such as improved anchor-free mechanisms and self-supervised learning,
allowing for more precise and efficient recognition of items in a variety of
settings. These findings highlight the YOLOv8 model's potential as an effective
tool in the global fight against pollution, improving both the detection
capabilities and scalability of underwater cleanup operations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着图像生成技术的快速发展，追踪生成图像的来源成为解决安全问题的关键，但现有方法在准确性和计算效率上存在不足。

Method: 提出AEDR方法，利用连续自编码器进行双重重建，通过损失比和图像同质性校准提高溯源准确性。

Result: 在八种顶级潜在扩散模型上，AEDR比现有方法准确率提高25.5%，计算时间仅需1%。

Conclusion: AEDR为生成模型的图像溯源提供了高效准确的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of image-generation technologies has made it possible
for anyone to create photorealistic images using generative models, raising
significant security concerns. To mitigate malicious use, tracing the origin of
such images is essential. Reconstruction-based attribution methods offer a
promising solution, but they often suffer from reduced accuracy and high
computational costs when applied to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. To address
these challenges, we propose AEDR (AutoEncoder Double-Reconstruction), a novel
training-free attribution method designed for generative models with continuous
autoencoders. Unlike existing reconstruction-based approaches that rely on the
value of a single reconstruction loss, AEDR performs two consecutive
reconstructions using the model's autoencoder, and adopts the ratio of these
two reconstruction losses as the attribution signal. This signal is further
calibrated using the image homogeneity metric to improve accuracy, which
inherently cancels out absolute biases caused by image complexity, with
autoencoder-based reconstruction ensuring superior computational efficiency.
Experiments on eight top latent diffusion models show that AEDR achieves 25.5%
higher attribution accuracy than existing reconstruction-based methods, while
requiring only 1% of the computational time.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在参数高效的情况下实现了鲁棒的点云分析，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Pre-trained point cloud analysis models have shown promising advancements in
various downstream tasks, yet their effectiveness is typically suffering from
low-quality point cloud (i.e., noise and incompleteness), which is a common
issue in real scenarios due to casual object occlusions and unsatisfactory data
collected by 3D sensors. To this end, existing methods focus on enhancing point
cloud quality by developing dedicated denoising and completion models. However,
due to the isolation between the point cloud enhancement and downstream tasks,
these methods fail to work in various real-world domains. In addition, the
conflicting objectives between denoising and completing tasks further limit the
ensemble paradigm to preserve critical geometric features. To tackle the above
challenges, we propose a unified point-level prompting method that reformulates
point cloud denoising and completion as a prompting mechanism, enabling robust
analysis in a parameter-efficient manner. We start by introducing a
Rectification Prompter to adapt to noisy points through the predicted
rectification vector prompts, effectively filtering noise while preserving
intricate geometric features essential for accurate analysis. Sequentially, we
further incorporate a Completion Prompter to generate auxiliary point prompts
based on the rectified point clouds, facilitating their robustness and
adaptability. Finally, a Shape-Aware Unit module is exploited to efficiently
unify and capture the filtered geometric features for the downstream point
cloud analysis.Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the
superiority and robustness of our method when handling noisy and incomplete
point cloud data against existing state-of-the-art methods. Our code is
released at https://github.com/zhoujiahuan1991/ICCV2025-UPP.

TL;DR: GPSMamba框架通过结合语义-频率提示和非因果监督，解决了红外图像超分辨率中因果建模的局限性，实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红外图像超分辨率（IRSR）因低对比度和稀疏纹理而具有挑战性，需要长程建模以保持全局一致性。

Method: 提出GPSMamba框架，包括自适应语义-频率状态空间模块（ASF-SSM）和热谱注意力与相位一致性损失，以整合非局部上下文并强制全局结构保真。

Result: 实验表明GPSMamba在红外图像恢复中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: GPSMamba为红外图像恢复提供了一种新的有效范式。

Abstract: Infrared Image Super-Resolution (IRSR) is challenged by the low contrast and
sparse textures of infrared data, requiring robust long-range modeling to
maintain global coherence. While State-Space Models like Mamba offer
proficiency in modeling long-range dependencies for this task, their inherent
1D causal scanning mechanism fragments the global context of 2D images,
hindering fine-detail restoration. To address this, we propose Global Phase and
Spectral Prompt-guided Mamba (GPSMamba), a framework that synergizes
architectural guidance with non-causal supervision. First, our Adaptive
Semantic-Frequency State Space Module (ASF-SSM) injects a fused
semantic-frequency prompt directly into the Mamba block, integrating non-local
context to guide reconstruction. Then, a novel Thermal-Spectral Attention and
Phase Consistency Loss provides explicit, non-causal supervision to enforce
global structural and spectral fidelity. By combining these two innovations,
our work presents a systematic strategy to mitigate the limitations of causal
modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GPSMamba achieves
state-of-the-art performance, validating our approach as a powerful new
paradigm for infrared image restoration. Code is available at

Conclusion: 研究为图像生成技术向高阶人类美学偏好发展提供了理论和实证支持。

Abstract: Contemporary image generation systems have achieved high fidelity and
superior aesthetic quality beyond basic text-image alignment. However, existing
evaluation frameworks have failed to evolve in parallel. This study reveals
that human preference reward models fine-tuned based on CLIP and BLIP
architectures have inherent flaws: they inappropriately assign low scores to
images with rich details and high aesthetic value, creating a significant
discrepancy with actual human aesthetic preferences. To address this issue, we
design a novel evaluation score, ICT (Image-Contained-Text) score, that
achieves and surpasses the objectives of text-image alignment by assessing the
degree to which images represent textual content. Building upon this
foundation, we further train an HP (High-Preference) score model using solely
the image modality to enhance image aesthetics and detail quality while
maintaining text-image alignment. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed
evaluation model improves scoring accuracy by over 10\% compared to existing
methods, and achieves significant results in optimizing state-of-the-art
text-to-image models. This research provides theoretical and empirical support
for evolving image generation technology toward higher-order human aesthetic
preferences. Code is available at https://github.com/BarretBa/ICTHP.

and employs an automatic prompt strategy that aligns upstream physical

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm
for integrating visual and textual information, supporting a wide range of
multi-modal tasks. However, these models often suffer from hallucination,
producing content that appears plausible but contradicts the input content or
established world knowledge. This survey offers an in-depth review of
hallucination evaluation benchmarks and detection methods across Image-to-Text
(I2T) and Text-to-image (T2I) generation tasks. Specifically, we first propose
a taxonomy of hallucination based on faithfulness and factuality, incorporating
the common types of hallucinations observed in practice. Then we provide an
overview of existing hallucination evaluation benchmarks for both T2I and I2T
tasks, highlighting their construction process, evaluation objectives, and
employed metrics. Furthermore, we summarize recent advances in hallucination
detection methods, which aims to identify hallucinated content at the instance
level and serve as a practical complement of benchmark-based evaluation.
Finally, we highlight key limitations in current benchmarks and detection
methods, and outline potential directions for future research.

Conclusion: 新框架有效解决了单次联邦学习在医疗领域的挑战，提升了效率和隐私保护能力。

Abstract: In multi-center scenarios, One-Shot Federated Learning (OSFL) has attracted
increasing attention due to its low communication overhead, requiring only a
single round of transmission. However, existing generative model-based OSFL
methods suffer from low training efficiency and potential privacy leakage in
the healthcare domain. Additionally, achieving convergence within a single
round of model aggregation is challenging under non-Independent and Identically
Distributed (non-IID) data. To address these challenges, in this paper a
modified OSFL framework is proposed, in which a new Feature-Guided Rectified
Flow Model (FG-RF) and Dual-Layer Knowledge Distillation (DLKD) aggregation
method are developed. FG-RF on the client side accelerates generative modeling
in medical imaging scenarios while preserving privacy by synthesizing
feature-level images rather than pixel-level images. To handle non-IID
distributions, DLKD enables the global student model to simultaneously mimic
the output logits and align the intermediate-layer features of client-side
teacher models during aggregation. Experimental results on three non-IID
medical imaging datasets show that our new framework and method outperform
multi-round federated learning approaches, achieving up to 21.73% improvement,
and exceeds the baseline FedISCA by an average of 21.75%. Furthermore, our
experiments demonstrate that feature-level synthetic images significantly
reduce privacy leakage risks compared to pixel-level synthetic images.

Result: 高容量注意力模型在ID数据上表现优异，但线性模型在OOD数据上更稳健，性能提升18%。语言特征未提升预测准确性。

Conclusion: 严格的OOD测试对构建稳健的神经AI模型至关重要，模型架构、刺激特性和感官层级共同影响多模态世界的神经编码。

Abstract: Predicting brain activity in response to naturalistic, multimodal stimuli is
a key challenge in computational neuroscience. While encoding models are
becoming more powerful, their ability to generalize to truly novel contexts
remains a critical, often untested, question. In this work, we developed brain
encoding models using state-of-the-art visual (X-CLIP) and auditory (Whisper)
feature extractors and rigorously evaluated them on both in-distribution (ID)
and diverse out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Our results reveal a fundamental
trade-off between model complexity and generalization: a higher-capacity
attention-based model excelled on ID data, but a simpler linear model was more
robust, outperforming a competitive baseline by 18\% on the OOD set.
Intriguingly, we found that linguistic features did not improve predictive
accuracy, suggesting that for familiar languages, neural encoding may be
dominated by the continuous visual and auditory streams over redundant textual
information. Spatially, our approach showed marked performance gains in the
auditory cortex, underscoring the benefit of high-fidelity speech
representations. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that rigorous OOD
testing is essential for building robust neuro-AI models and provides nuanced
insights into how model architecture, stimulus characteristics, and sensory
hierarchies shape the neural encoding of our rich, multimodal world.

TL;DR: 论文提出GR-CLIP方法，通过校准CLIP嵌入空间的模态间隙，显著提升混合模态搜索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混合模态搜索（跨图像、文本和多模态文档检索）是重要但未充分探索的实际应用，现有对比视觉语言模型（如CLIP）存在模态间隙问题。

Method: 提出GR-CLIP，一种轻量级后校准方法，消除CLIP嵌入空间中的模态间隙。

Result: 在MixBench基准测试中，GR-CLIP将NDCG@10提升26个百分点，优于生成嵌入模型4个百分点，计算量减少75倍。

Conclusion: GR-CLIP有效解决了模态间隙问题，显著提升了混合模态搜索的性能和效率。

Abstract: Mixed modality search -- retrieving information across a heterogeneous corpus
composed of images, texts, and multimodal documents -- is an important yet
underexplored real-world application. In this work, we investigate how
contrastive vision-language models, such as CLIP, perform on the mixed modality
search task. Our analysis reveals a critical limitation: these models exhibit a
pronounced modality gap in the embedding space, where image and text embeddings
form distinct clusters, leading to intra-modal ranking bias and inter-modal
fusion failure. To address this issue, we propose GR-CLIP, a lightweight
post-hoc calibration method that removes the modality gap in CLIP's embedding
space. Evaluated on MixBench -- the first benchmark specifically designed for
mixed modality search -- GR-CLIP improves NDCG@10 by up to 26 percentage points
over CLIP, surpasses recent vision-language generative embedding models by 4
percentage points, while using 75x less compute.

TL;DR: ScenePainter提出了一种解决3D场景生成中语义漂移问题的新框架，通过层次化图结构SceneConceptGraph实现语义一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在3D场景生成中依赖外推模块，导致语义漂移问题，影响生成序列的连贯性。

Method: 引入SceneConceptGraph层次化图结构，动态优化外推模块的场景特定先验，确保语义一致性。

Result: 实验表明，ScenePainter能有效解决语义漂移问题，生成更一致且沉浸的3D视图序列。

Conclusion: ScenePainter通过层次化图结构提升了3D场景生成的语义一致性和多样性。

Abstract: Perpetual 3D scene generation aims to produce long-range and coherent 3D view
sequences, which is applicable for long-term video synthesis and 3D scene
reconstruction. Existing methods follow a "navigate-and-imagine" fashion and
rely on outpainting for successive view expansion. However, the generated view
sequences suffer from semantic drift issue derived from the accumulated
deviation of the outpainting module. To tackle this challenge, we propose
ScenePainter, a new framework for semantically consistent 3D scene generation,
which aligns the outpainter's scene-specific prior with the comprehension of
the current scene. To be specific, we introduce a hierarchical graph structure
dubbed SceneConceptGraph to construct relations among multi-level scene
concepts, which directs the outpainter for consistent novel views and can be
dynamically refined to enhance diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our framework overcomes the semantic drift issue and generates more
consistent and immersive 3D view sequences. Project Page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的噪声弹性查询优化（NRQO）范式，通过NT-FPN和PS-RPN解决Transformer检测器在小物体检测中的噪声敏感性和查询质量问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Transformer检测器在特征金字塔网络（FPN）中存在噪声敏感性，且标签分配策略的查询质量下降，影响了小物体检测性能。

Method: NRQO结合了噪声容忍特征金字塔网络（NT-FPN）和成对相似性区域提议网络（PS-RPN）。NT-FPN在特征融合中减少噪声，PS-RPN通过位置和形状相似性提高查询质量。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，NRQO显著优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: NRQO通过创新的噪声容忍和查询优化机制，有效提升了小物体检测的性能。

Abstract: Despite advancements in Transformer-based detectors for small object
detection (SOD), recent studies show that these detectors still face challenges
due to inherent noise sensitivity in feature pyramid networks (FPN) and
diminished query quality in existing label assignment strategies. In this
paper, we propose a novel Noise-Resilient Query Optimization (NRQO) paradigm,
which innovatively incorporates the Noise-Tolerance Feature Pyramid Network
(NT-FPN) and the Pairwise-Similarity Region Proposal Network (PS-RPN).
Specifically, NT-FPN mitigates noise during feature fusion in FPN by preserving
spatial and semantic information integrity. Unlike existing label assignment
strategies, PS-RPN generates a sufficient number of high-quality positive
queries by enhancing anchor-ground truth matching through position and shape
similarities, without the need for additional hyperparameters. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks consistently demonstrate the superiority of
NRQO over state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: 论文研究了视觉语言模型（VLMs）中较少被探讨的否定理解问题，提出了一种低资源消耗的Negation-Aware Test-Time Adaptation（NEAT）方法，有效解决了否定分布与肯定分布之间的概念偏移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中需要模型识别虚假或不存在的内容（如医学图像排除特定条件），但现有VLMs在否定理解上表现不佳，且传统数据密集型方法资源消耗大。

Method: 提出NEAT方法，通过调整推理过程中与分布相关的参数，减少语义一致性的分布偏移，并消除无关语义的虚假分布一致性。

Result: 在多种否定理解任务上的实验验证了NEAT的有效性。

Conclusion: NEAT为低资源环境下解决VLMs的否定理解问题提供了可行方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we study a practical but less-touched problem in
Vision-Language Models (VLMs), \ie, negation understanding. Specifically, many
real-world applications require models to explicitly identify what is false or
non-existent, \eg, radiologists may search for images that exclude specific
conditions. Despite the impressive transferability of VLMs through large-scale
training, they suffer from a critical limitation that fails to handle negation.
To address this challenge, existing methods attribute its root cause to the
scarcity of negation training data and propose to fine-tune VLMs on massive
data containing explicit negation. Undoubtedly, such data-centric solutions
demand substantial data and computational resources, limiting their sustainable
widespread adoption. To tackle negation in a low-carbon manner, we empirically
observe that the key obstacle lies in the dual-concept shifts between the
affirmation and negation distributions. Therefore, we propose a Negation-Aware
Test-Time Adaptation (NEAT) method to efficiently adjust distribution-related
parameters during inference. In brief, NEAT can reduce distribution shift in
consistent semantics while eliminating false distributional consistency in
unrelated semantics. Extensive experiments on the various negation
understanding tasks verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The code
is available at https://github.com/hhc1997/NEAT.

Result: 在基准数据集上定性和定量评估均优于现有方法，且对新被试适应性强。

Conclusion: 提出的框架显著提升了跨被试fMRI信号解码的准确性和重建质量。

Abstract: Decoding stimulus images from fMRI signals has advanced with pre-trained
generative models. However, existing methods struggle with cross-subject
mappings due to cognitive variability and subject-specific differences. This
challenge arises from sequential errors, where unidirectional mappings generate
partially inaccurate representations that, when fed into diffusion models,
accumulate errors and degrade reconstruction fidelity. To address this, we
propose the Bidirectional Autoencoder Intertwining framework for accurate
decoded representation prediction. Our approach unifies multiple subjects
through a Subject Bias Modulation Module while leveraging bidirectional mapping
to better capture data distributions for precise representation prediction. To
further enhance fidelity when decoding representations into stimulus images, we
introduce a Semantic Refinement Module to improve semantic representations and
a Visual Coherence Module to mitigate the effects of inaccurate visual
representations. Integrated with ControlNet and Stable Diffusion, our method
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on benchmark datasets in both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Moreover, our framework exhibits
strong adaptability to new subjects with minimal training samples.

Conclusion: SP-Mamba通过结合空间感知和高效计算，为医学异常检测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Radiography imaging protocols target on specific anatomical regions,
resulting in highly consistent images with recurrent structural patterns across
patients. Recent advances in medical anomaly detection have demonstrated the
effectiveness of CNN- and transformer-based approaches. However, CNNs exhibit
limitations in capturing long-range dependencies, while transformers suffer
from quadratic computational complexity. In contrast, Mamba-based models,
leveraging superior long-range modeling, structural feature extraction, and
linear computational efficiency, have emerged as a promising alternative. To
capitalize on the inherent structural regularity of medical images, this study
introduces SP-Mamba, a spatial-perception Mamba framework for unsupervised
medical anomaly detection. The window-sliding prototype learning and
Circular-Hilbert scanning-based Mamba are introduced to better exploit
consistent anatomical patterns and leverage spatial information for medical
anomaly detection. Furthermore, we excavate the concentration and contrast
characteristics of anomaly maps for improving anomaly detection. Extensive
experiments on three diverse medical anomaly detection benchmarks confirm the
proposed method's state-of-the-art performance, validating its efficacy and
robustness. The code is available at https://github.com/Ray-RuiPan/SP-Mamba.

Motivation: 多任务学习（MTL）在密集预测中表现良好，但仍面临共享表示与任务特定专业化之间的平衡挑战。

Method: 1. 提出任务内专家，沿MLP的中间隐藏维度划分任务信息；2. 引入共享专家，整合任务内不同上下文的通用信息；3. 设计全局专家，促进任务间自适应知识转移。此外，采用微调方法仅训练解码器参数以提高效率。

Conclusion: FGMoE通过细粒度的专家设计和微调方法，有效提升了多任务学习的性能与参数效率。

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) for dense prediction has shown promising results
but still faces challenges in balancing shared representations with
task-specific specialization. In this paper, we introduce a novel Fine-Grained
Mixture of Experts (FGMoE) architecture that explores MoE-based MTL models
through a combination of three key innovations and fine-tuning. First, we
propose intra-task experts that partition along intermediate hidden dimensions
of MLPs, enabling finer decomposition of task information while maintaining
parameter efficiency. Second, we introduce shared experts that consolidate
common information across different contexts of the same task, reducing
redundancy, and allowing routing experts to focus on unique aspects. Third, we
design a global expert that facilitates adaptive knowledge transfer across
tasks based on both input feature and task requirements, promoting beneficial
information sharing while preventing harmful interference. In addition, we use
the fine-tuning approach to improve parameter efficiency only by training the
parameters of the decoder. Extensive experimental results show that the
proposed FGMoE uses fewer parameters and significantly outperforms current
MoE-based competitive MTL models on two dense prediction datasets
(\textit{i.e.,} NYUD-v2, PASCAL-Context) in various metrics.

Conclusion: MedSymmFlow在医学图像分类和不确定性估计方面表现出色，适用于临床高风险场景。

Abstract: Reliable medical image classification requires accurate predictions and
well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, especially in high-stakes clinical
settings. This work presents MedSymmFlow, a generative-discriminative hybrid
model built on Symmetrical Flow Matching, designed to unify classification,
generation, and uncertainty quantification in medical imaging. MedSymmFlow
leverages a latent-space formulation that scales to high-resolution inputs and
introduces a semantic mask conditioning mechanism to enhance diagnostic
relevance. Unlike standard discriminative models, it naturally estimates
uncertainty through its generative sampling process. The model is evaluated on
four MedMNIST datasets, covering a range of modalities and pathologies. The
results show that MedSymmFlow matches or exceeds the performance of established
baselines in classification accuracy and AUC, while also delivering reliable
uncertainty estimates validated by performance improvements under selective

Conclusion: LISA是一种即插即用的方法，能有效减少物体幻觉，提升多模态大语言模型的生成质量。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language tasks such
as image captioning but remain prone to object hallucinations, where they
describe objects that do not appear in the image. To mitigate this, we propose
\textbf{LISA}, a \textbf{L}ayer-wise \textbf{I}ntegration and
\textbf{S}uppression \textbf{A}pproach that enhances generation consistency
through hierarchical modulation and multi-layer fusion. LISA leverages the
functional hierarchy within MLLMs, where shallow layers provide visual
grounding, middle layers encode semantics, and deep layers tend to amplify
spurious signals. First, zone-specific spectral modulation stabilizes attention
by suppressing over-amplified activations in deeper layers while preserving
alignment cues in earlier layers. Second, token-level logits from selected
layers are fused via anchor-based routing, with token-wise anchor selection and
soft logit fusion enabling adaptive integration during decoding. LISA is fully
\textbf{plug-and-play} and can be seamlessly integrated into existing MLLMs,
including Qwen2.5-VL. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that LISA reduces
hallucinations by up to 53.6\% in $\mathrm{CHAIR}_I$ and improves POPE F1 by
4.5\%, demonstrating strong generalization across models and tasks.

Method: 结合尺度不变关键点检测，构建对应关系图，并将相似性匹配重新定义为分类任务，使用SoftMax和全卷积网络（FCN）层。

Conclusion: CSTF机制通过增强特征匹配能力，显著提升了遥感图像下游任务（如目标检测）的性能。

Abstract: Effectively describing features for cross-modal remote sensing image matching
remains a challenging task due to the significant geometric and radiometric
differences between multimodal images. Existing methods primarily extract
features at the fully connected layer but often fail to capture cross-modal
similarities effectively. We propose a Cross Spatial Temporal Fusion (CSTF)
mechanism that enhances feature representation by integrating scale-invariant
keypoints detected independently in both reference and query images. Our
approach improves feature matching in two ways: First, by creating
correspondence maps that leverage information from multiple image regions
simultaneously, and second, by reformulating the similarity matching process as
a classification task using SoftMax and Fully Convolutional Network (FCN)
layers. This dual approach enables CSTF to maintain sensitivity to distinctive
local features while incorporating broader contextual information, resulting in
robust matching across diverse remote sensing modalities. To demonstrate the
practical utility of improved feature matching, we evaluate CSTF on object
detection tasks using the HRSC2016 and DOTA benchmark datasets. Our method
achieves state-of-theart performance with an average mAP of 90.99% on HRSC2016
and 90.86% on DOTA, outperforming existing models. The CSTF model maintains
computational efficiency with an inference speed of 12.5 FPS. These results
validate that our approach to crossmodal feature matching directly enhances
downstream remote sensing applications such as object detection.

Conclusion: PatchTraj通过统一时域和频域表示，显著提升了轨迹预测的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Pedestrian trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous driving and
robotics. While existing point-based and grid-based methods expose two key
limitations: insufficiently modeling human motion dynamics, as they fail to
balance local motion details with long-range spatiotemporal dependencies, and
the time representation lacks interaction with the frequency domain in modeling
trajectory sequences. To address these challenges, we propose PatchTraj, a
dynamic patch-based trajectory prediction framework that unifies time-domain
and frequency-domain representations. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory
into raw time sequences and frequency components, employing dynamic patch
partitioning for multi-scale trajectory segmentation to capture hierarchical
motion patterns. Each patch is processed by an adaptive embedding layer with
scale-aware feature extraction, followed by hierarchical feature aggregation to
model both fine-grained and long-range dependencies. The outputs of two
branches interact via cross-modal attention, enabling complementary fusion of
temporal and spectral cues. Finally, a Transformer encoder-decoder integrates
both modalities to autoregressively predict future trajectories. Extensive
experiments on ETH-UCY, SDD, NBA, and JRDB datasets demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance with high efficiency.

Conclusion: TopGeoFormer通过结合拓扑和几何特征，有效提升了点云恢复的性能。

Abstract: Recovering point clouds involves the sequential process of sampling and
restoration, yet existing methods struggle to effectively leverage both
topological and geometric attributes. To address this, we propose an end-to-end
architecture named \textbf{TopGeoFormer}, which maintains these critical
features throughout the sampling and restoration phases. First, we revisit
traditional feature extraction techniques to yield topological embedding using
a continuous mapping of relative relationships between neighboring points, and
integrate it in both phases for preserving the structure of the original space.
Second, we propose the \textbf{InterTwining Attention} to fully merge
topological and geometric embeddings, which queries shape with local awareness
in both phases to form a learnable shape context facilitated with point-wise,
point-shape-wise, and intra-shape features. Third, we introduce a full geometry
loss and a topological constraint loss to optimize the embeddings in both
Euclidean and topological spaces. The geometry loss uses inconsistent matching
between coarse-to-fine generations and targets for reconstructing better
geometric details, and the constraint loss limits embedding variances for
better approximation of the topological space. In experiments, we
comprehensively analyze the circumstances using the conventional and
learning-based sampling/upsampling algorithms. The quantitative and qualitative
results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing sampling
and recovery methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决量化视觉Transformer中激活稀疏性未被充分利用的问题，以提升量化模型的性能和效率。

Method: 提出MixA-Q框架，通过分离窗口计算并为不重要窗口分配低比特宽度，结合Two-Branch Swin Block实现高低比特精度处理。

Result: 在COCO数据集上，MixA-Q在PTQ配置下实现1.35倍加速且无精度损失，QAT配置下实现1.25倍加速或1.53倍加速（仅1% mAP下降）。

Conclusion: MixA-Q通过稀疏感知量化适配显著降低量化误差，提升量化模型性能，尤其在低比特配置下效果显著。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose MixA-Q, a mixed-precision activation quantization
framework that leverages intra-layer activation sparsity (a concept widely
explored in activation pruning methods) for efficient inference of quantized
window-based vision transformers. For a given uniform-bit quantization
configuration, MixA-Q separates the batched window computations within Swin
blocks and assigns a lower bit width to the activations of less important
windows, improving the trade-off between model performance and efficiency. We
introduce a Two-Branch Swin Block that processes activations separately in
high- and low-bit precision, enabling seamless integration of our method with
most quantization-aware training (QAT) and post-training quantization (PTQ)
methods, or with simple modifications. Our experimental evaluations over the
COCO dataset demonstrate that MixA-Q achieves a training-free 1.35x
computational speedup without accuracy loss in PTQ configuration. With QAT,
MixA-Q achieves a lossless 1.25x speedup and a 1.53x speedup with only a 1% mAP
drop by incorporating activation pruning. Notably, by reducing the quantization
error in important regions, our sparsity-aware quantization adaptation improves
the mAP of the quantized W4A4 model (with both weights and activations in 4-bit
precision) by 0.7%, reducing quantization degradation by 24%.

Result: PAHNet在PASCAL-5^i和COCO-20^i数据集上的1-shot和5-shot设置中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PAHNet通过平衡保守与激进信息，有效提升了少样本分割的准确性。

Abstract: This paper studies the few-shot segmentation (FSS) task, which aims to
segment objects belonging to unseen categories in a query image by learning a
model on a small number of well-annotated support samples. Our analysis of two
mainstream FSS paradigms reveals that the predictions made by prototype
learning methods are usually conservative, while those of affinity learning
methods tend to be more aggressive. This observation motivates us to balance
the conservative and aggressive information captured by these two types of FSS
frameworks so as to improve the segmentation performance. To achieve this, we
propose a **P**rototype-**A**ffinity **H**ybrid **Net**work (PAHNet), which
introduces a Prototype-guided Feature Enhancement (PFE) module and an Attention
Score Calibration (ASC) module in each attention block of an affinity learning
model (called affinity learner). These two modules utilize the predictions
generated by a pre-trained prototype learning model (called prototype
predictor) to enhance the foreground information in support and query image
representations and suppress the mismatched foreground-background (FG-BG)
relationships between them, respectively. In this way, the aggressiveness of
the affinity learner can be effectively mitigated, thereby eventually
increasing the segmentation accuracy of our PAHNet method. Experimental results
show that PAHNet outperforms most recently proposed methods across 1-shot and
5-shot settings on both PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ datasets, suggesting its

*Jie Chen,Zhangchi Hu,Peixi Wu,Huyue Zhu,Hebei Li,Xiaoyan Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DASH是一个实时动态场景渲染框架，通过4D哈希编码和自监督分解解决动态高斯泼溅中的特征重叠和渲染质量问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有平面方法在动态高斯泼溅中因低秩假设导致特征重叠和渲染质量差，而4D哈希编码直接应用于整个动态场景会导致哈希冲突和冗余。

Method: DASH采用自监督分解机制分离动态和静态组件，引入多分辨率4D哈希编码器动态元素，并提出时空平滑正则化策略。

Result: 在真实数据集上，DASH实现了264 FPS的实时渲染性能，视觉质量显著提升。

Conclusion: DASH通过创新方法解决了动态场景渲染中的关键问题，实现了高质量的实时渲染。

Abstract: Dynamic scene reconstruction is a long-term challenge in 3D vision. Existing
plane-based methods in dynamic Gaussian splatting suffer from an unsuitable
low-rank assumption, causing feature overlap and poor rendering quality.
Although 4D hash encoding provides an explicit representation without low-rank
constraints, directly applying it to the entire dynamic scene leads to
substantial hash collisions and redundancy. To address these challenges, we
present DASH, a real-time dynamic scene rendering framework that employs 4D
hash encoding coupled with self-supervised decomposition. Our approach begins
with a self-supervised decomposition mechanism that separates dynamic and
static components without manual annotations or precomputed masks. Next, we
introduce a multiresolution 4D hash encoder for dynamic elements, providing an
explicit representation that avoids the low-rank assumption. Finally, we
present a spatio-temporal smoothness regularization strategy to mitigate
unstable deformation artifacts. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate
that DASH achieves state-of-the-art dynamic rendering performance, exhibiting
enhanced visual quality at real-time speeds of 264 FPS on a single 4090 GPU.

*Yuki Igaue,Hiroaki Aizawa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多头自注意力权重方差的补丁剪枝策略，以提高计算效率并保持分类准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多头自注意力在视觉Transformer中计算复杂度高，补丁剪枝是解决这一问题的有效方法。

Method: 通过评估多头自注意力权重的方差或中位数绝对偏差来确定补丁重要性，并结合重叠补丁嵌入提升性能。

Result: 在保持分类准确性的同时提高了计算效率，重叠补丁嵌入进一步提升了性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在训练和推理中均适用，为高效视觉Transformer提供了一种有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-head self-attention is a distinctive feature extraction mechanism of
vision transformers that computes pairwise relationships among all input
patches, contributing significantly to their high performance. However, it is
known to incur a quadratic computational complexity with respect to the number
of patches. One promising approach to address this issue is patch pruning,
which improves computational efficiency by identifying and removing redundant
patches. In this work, we propose a patch pruning strategy that evaluates the
importance of each patch based on the variance of attention weights across
multiple attention heads. This approach is inspired by the design of multi-head
self-attention, which aims to capture diverse attention patterns across
different subspaces of feature representations. The proposed method can be
easily applied during both training and inference, and achieves improved
throughput while maintaining classification accuracy in scenarios such as
fine-tuning with pre-trained models. In addition, we also found that using
robust statistical measures, such as the median absolute deviation in place of
variance, to assess patch importance can similarly lead to strong performance.
Furthermore, by introducing overlapping patch embeddings, our method achieves
better performance with comparable throughput to conventional approaches that
utilize all patches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于持续学习的统一图像修复框架，适用于多种天气条件下的图像恢复，通过选择性核融合、弹性权重巩固和循环对比损失等创新方法，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多针对单一天气条件，而自动驾驶等应用需要统一模型处理多种天气条件下的图像修复。

Method: 采用选择性核融合层动态结合全局与局部特征，弹性权重巩固防止灾难性遗忘，循环对比损失增强特征区分度，并提出非配对图像修复方法减少对训练数据的依赖。

Result: 在去雾、去雪和去雨任务的标准数据集上，PSNR、SSIM和感知质量均显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的统一框架通过持续学习和创新损失函数，有效解决了多种天气条件下的图像修复问题。

Abstract: Restoration of images contaminated by different adverse weather conditions
such as fog, snow, and rain is a challenging task due to the varying nature of
the weather conditions. Most of the existing methods focus on any one
particular weather conditions. However, for applications such as autonomous
driving, a unified model is necessary to perform restoration of corrupted
images due to different weather conditions. We propose a continual learning
approach to propose a unified framework for image restoration. The proposed
framework integrates three key innovations: (1) Selective Kernel Fusion layers
that dynamically combine global and local features for robust adaptive feature
selection; (2) Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) to enable continual learning
and mitigate catastrophic forgetting across multiple restoration tasks; and (3)
a novel Cycle-Contrastive Loss that enhances feature discrimination while
preserving semantic consistency during domain translation. Further, we propose
an unpaired image restoration approach to reduce the dependance of the proposed
approach on the training data. Extensive experiments on standard benchmark
datasets for dehazing, desnowing and deraining tasks demonstrate significant
improvements in PSNR, SSIM, and perceptual quality over the state-of-the-art.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisHall3D是一个两阶段框架，用于单目语义场景补全，解决现有方法中的特征纠缠和几何不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在特征纠缠和几何一致性方面存在问题，VisHall3D旨在通过两阶段分解任务来解决这些问题。

Method: VisHall3D分为两个阶段：可见区域重建（Vision）和不可见区域推断（Hallucination），分别使用VisFrontierNet和OcclusionMAE模块。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI和SSCBench-KITTI-360基准测试中，VisHall3D表现优异，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: VisHall3D通过两阶段设计有效提升了场景补全质量，为自动驾驶等应用提供了更准确的场景理解。

Abstract: This paper introduces VisHall3D, a novel two-stage framework for monocular
semantic scene completion that aims to address the issues of feature
entanglement and geometric inconsistency prevalent in existing methods.
VisHall3D decomposes the scene completion task into two stages: reconstructing
the visible regions (vision) and inferring the invisible regions
(hallucination). In the first stage, VisFrontierNet, a visibility-aware
projection module, is introduced to accurately trace the visual frontier while
preserving fine-grained details. In the second stage, OcclusionMAE, a
hallucination network, is employed to generate plausible geometries for the
invisible regions using a noise injection mechanism. By decoupling scene
completion into these two distinct stages, VisHall3D effectively mitigates
feature entanglement and geometric inconsistency, leading to significantly
improved reconstruction quality.
  The effectiveness of VisHall3D is validated through extensive experiments on
two challenging benchmarks: SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360. VisHall3D
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming previous methods by a
significant margin and paves the way for more accurate and reliable scene
understanding in autonomous driving and other applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出CounterNet，一种基于热图的网络，用于提高大规模点云数据中物体计数的准确性，从而优化查询结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆生成大量点云数据，但只有部分数据对特定任务（如碰撞检测、交通分析）相关。现有方法在3D点云数据中计数不准确，导致查询结果错误。

Method: 提出CounterNet，通过检测物体中心而非精确定位来提高计数准确性，并采用特征图分区策略和动态模型选择策略。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上，CounterNet将计数准确性提高了5%至20%，显著改善了查询结果的可靠性。

Conclusion: CounterNet通过改进计数准确性，为点云数据查询提供了更可靠的结果。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles generate massive volumes of point cloud data, yet only a
subset is relevant for specific tasks such as collision detection, traffic
analysis, or congestion monitoring. Effectively querying this data is essential
to enable targeted analytics. In this work, we formalize point cloud querying
by defining three core query types: RETRIEVAL, COUNT, and AGGREGATION, each
aligned with distinct analytical scenarios. All these queries rely heavily on
accurate object counts to produce meaningful results, making precise object
counting a critical component of query execution. Prior work has focused on
indexing techniques for 2D video data, assuming detection models provide
accurate counting information. However, when applied to 3D point cloud data,
state-of-the-art detection models often fail to generate reliable object
counts, leading to substantial errors in query results. To address this
limitation, we propose CounterNet, a heatmap-based network designed for
accurate object counting in large-scale point cloud data. Rather than focusing
on accurate object localization, CounterNet detects object presence by finding
object centers to improve counting accuracy. We further enhance its performance
with a feature map partitioning strategy using overlapping regions, enabling
better handling of both small and large objects in complex traffic scenes. To
adapt to varying frame characteristics, we introduce a per-frame dynamic model
selection strategy that selects the most effective configuration for each
input. Evaluations on three real-world autonomous vehicle datasets show that
CounterNet improves counting accuracy by 5% to 20% across object categories,
resulting in more reliable query outcomes across all supported query types.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型和数据集忽视了主观认知多样性对注视行为的影响，且传统显著性预测模型无法捕捉个性化注意力模式。

Method: 提出SPA-ADV数据集和PRE-MAP模型，利用强化学习优化眼动预测，并结合多属性用户配置文件。

Result: 在SPA-ADV和其他基准测试中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: SPA-ADV和PRE-MAP为个性化视觉注意力研究提供了新工具，解决了现有模型的局限性。

Abstract: Visual selective attention, driven by individual preferences, regulates human
prioritization of visual stimuli by bridging subjective cognitive mechanisms
with objective visual elements, thereby steering the semantic interpretation
and hierarchical processing of dynamic visual scenes. However, existing models
and datasets predominantly neglect the influence of subjective cognitive
diversity on fixation behavior. Conventional saliency prediction models,
typically employing segmentation approaches, rely on low-resolution imagery to
generate saliency heatmaps, subsequently upscaled to native resolutions, which
limiting their capacity to capture personalized attention patterns.
Furthermore, MLLMs are constrained by factors such as hallucinations, making it
very costly to strictly adhere to the expected format in tasks involving
multiple point predictions, and achieving precise point positioning is
challenging. To address these limitations, we present Subjective Personalized
Attention for Advertisement Videos, namely SPA-ADV, a large-scale multimodal
dataset capturing gaze behaviors from over 4,500 participants varying in age
and gender with 486 videos. Furthermore, we propose PRE-MAP, a novel
eye-tracking saliency model that characterizes Personalized visual disparities
through Reinforcement learning-optimized Eye-tracking, built upon MLLMs and
guided by Multi-Attribute user profiles to predict Points. To ensure MLLMs
produce prediction points that are both format-correct and spatially accurate,
we introduce Consistency Group Relative Policy Optimization (C-GRPO), inspired
by the variability in eye movement points and Multi-Attribute profiles.
Extensive experiments on SPA-ADV and other benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. The code and dataset are available at

TL;DR: 提出一个框架，利用大型语言模型生成多人类动态场景的上下文运动，解决人类与场景交互的复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多人类动态场景的生成需要全面推理人类与人类、人类与场景之间的动态关系，现有方法难以处理这种复杂性。

Method: 通过事件生成器将动态场景分解为小事件序列，每个事件调用相关角色和对象的运动，并利用空间引导采样位置。

Result: 框架在基准测试和用户研究中表现出高效捕捉场景上下文的能力，具有高扩展性。

Conclusion: 该框架首次在大规模和多样性上解决了多人类动态场景生成问题，并提供了评估基准。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a framework that creates a lively virtual dynamic
scene with contextual motions of multiple humans. Generating multi-human
contextual motion requires holistic reasoning over dynamic relationships among
human-human and human-scene interactions. We adapt the power of a large
language model (LLM) to digest the contextual complexity within textual input
and convert the task into tangible subproblems such that we can generate
multi-agent behavior beyond the scale that was not considered before.
Specifically, our event generator formulates the temporal progression of a
dynamic scene into a sequence of small events. Each event calls for a
well-defined motion involving relevant characters and objects. Next, we
synthesize the motions of characters at positions sampled based on spatial
guidance. We employ a high-level module to deliver scalable yet comprehensive
context, translating events into relative descriptions that enable the
retrieval of precise coordinates. As the first to address this problem at scale
and with diversity, we offer a benchmark to assess diverse aspects of
contextual reasoning. Benchmark results and user studies show that our
framework effectively captures scene context with high scalability. The code
and benchmark, along with result videos, are available at our project page:

Result: 在V2X-Seq和Griffin数据集上表现优异，达到39.0% mAP和32.8% AMOTA。

Conclusion: CoopTrack通过实例级特征传输和自适应关联，显著提升了协作感知能力。

Abstract: Cooperative perception aims to address the inherent limitations of
single-vehicle autonomous driving systems through information exchange among
multiple agents. Previous research has primarily focused on single-frame
perception tasks. However, the more challenging cooperative sequential
perception tasks, such as cooperative 3D multi-object tracking, have not been
thoroughly investigated. Therefore, we propose CoopTrack, a fully
instance-level end-to-end framework for cooperative tracking, featuring
learnable instance association, which fundamentally differs from existing
approaches. CoopTrack transmits sparse instance-level features that
significantly enhance perception capabilities while maintaining low
transmission costs. Furthermore, the framework comprises two key components:
Multi-Dimensional Feature Extraction, and Cross-Agent Association and
Aggregation, which collectively enable comprehensive instance representation
with semantic and motion features, and adaptive cross-agent association and
fusion based on a feature graph. Experiments on both the V2X-Seq and Griffin
datasets demonstrate that CoopTrack achieves excellent performance.
Specifically, it attains state-of-the-art results on V2X-Seq, with 39.0\% mAP
and 32.8\% AMOTA. The project is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的多模态异常检测框架，解决了2D信息不足以识别3D深度异常的问题，并通过异常生成模拟真实异常样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于2D信息无法充分表示3D深度异常，且工业数据中异常样本稀缺，需要一种方法统一处理多模态信息并生成异常样本。

Method: 从3D点云数据提取深度信息，结合2D RGB图像表示外观；提出多尺度高斯异常生成器和统一纹理异常生成器；模块共享RGB和深度数据参数。

Result: 在MVTec-3D AD和Eyecandies数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架有效桥接了2D和3D异常检测，无需复杂融合即可利用多模态特征。

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection for 2D objects has gained significant attention
and achieved progress in anomaly detection (AD) methods. However, identifying
3D depth anomalies using only 2D information is insufficient. Despite
explicitly fusing depth information into RGB images or using point cloud
backbone networks to extract depth features, both approaches struggle to
adequately represent 3D information in multimodal scenarios due to the
disparities among different modal information. Additionally, due to the
scarcity of abnormal samples in industrial data, especially in multimodal
scenarios, it is necessary to perform anomaly generation to simulate real-world
abnormal samples. Therefore, we propose a novel unified multimodal anomaly
detection framework to address these issues. Our contributions consist of 3 key
aspects. (1) We extract visible depth information from 3D point cloud data
simply and use 2D RGB images to represent appearance, which disentangles depth
and appearance to support unified anomaly generation. (2) Benefiting from the
flexible input representation, the proposed Multi-Scale Gaussian Anomaly
Generator and Unified Texture Anomaly Generator can generate richer anomalies
in RGB and depth. (3) All modules share parameters for both RGB and depth data,
effectively bridging 2D and 3D anomaly detection. Subsequent modules can
directly leverage features from both modalities without complex fusion.
Experiments show our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) on MVTec-3D AD
and Eyecandies datasets. Code available at:

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（VLMs）在生成长且事实性强的描述时表现不佳，传统评估方法不适用于长描述或无人工标注的场景。

Method: 利用开放词汇视觉定位和工具验证，设计无需参考的评估方法，同时衡量描述性（召回）和事实精确性。

Result: OV-Fact过滤的训练数据（减少2.5-5倍）显著提升事实精确性，同时保持描述性。

Conclusion: OV-Fact为长描述的事实性评估提供了高效且无需人工标注的解决方案，适用于数据过滤和模型优化。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) often struggle to generate long and
factual captions. However, traditional measures for hallucination and
factuality are not well suited for evaluating longer, more diverse captions and
in settings where ground-truth human-annotated captions are unavailable. We
introduce OV-Fact, a novel method for measuring caption factuality of long
captions that leverages open-vocabulary visual grounding and tool-based
verification without depending on human annotations. Our method improves
agreement with human judgments and captures both caption descriptiveness
(recall) and factual precision in the same metric. Furthermore, unlike previous
metrics, our reference-free method design enables new applications towards
factuality-based data filtering. We observe models trained on an
OVFact-filtered (2.5-5x less) subset of a large-scale, noisy (VLM-generated)
pretraining set meaningfully improve factuality precision without sacrificing
caption descriptiveness across a range of downstream long caption benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖复杂架构或数据填补技术，SimMLM旨在提供通用且高效的解决方案，适应各种模态缺失情况。

Method: 采用动态专家混合架构（DMoME）和MoFe排名损失，动态调整模态贡献，确保任务准确性随模态增加而提升或稳定。

Result: 在医学图像分割和多模态分类任务中，SimMLM表现优于竞争方法，准确性、可解释性和鲁棒性均显著提升。

Conclusion: SimMLM为多模态学习提供了一种高效、通用的解决方案，尤其在模态缺失场景下表现出色。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose SimMLM, a simple yet powerful framework for
multimodal learning with missing modalities. Unlike existing approaches that
rely on sophisticated network architectures or complex data imputation
techniques, SimMLM provides a generic and effective solution that can adapt to
various missing modality scenarios with improved accuracy and robustness.
Specifically, SimMLM consists of a generic Dynamic Mixture of Modality Experts
(DMoME) architecture, featuring a dynamic, learnable gating mechanism that
automatically adjusts each modality's contribution in both full and partial
modality settings. A key innovation of SimMLM is the proposed More vs. Fewer
(MoFe) ranking loss, which ensures that task accuracy improves or remains
stable as more modalities are made available. This aligns the model with an
intuitive principle: removing one or more modalities should not increase
accuracy. We validate SimMLM on multimodal medical image segmentation (BraTS
2018) and multimodal classification (UPMC Food-101, avMNIST) tasks, where it
consistently surpasses competitive methods, demonstrating superior accuracy,
interpretability, robustness, and reliability across both complete and missing
modality scenarios at test time.

We introduce a video-distilled single-image encoder trained to predict the

3D spatial and temporal priors without optical flow or tracking. When
pre-training on a single 2-hour video, our approach raises the mean
Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) on ADE20K from 35.0 (DoRA) to 36.4 while
remaining a drop-in replacement for image-only pipelines. Our results highlight
video self-distillation as a lightweight route to geometry-aware perception an

Abstract: Remote sensing imagery presents vast, inherently unstructured spatial data,
demanding sophisticated reasoning to interpret complex user intents and
contextual relationships beyond simple recognition tasks. In this paper, we aim
to construct an Earth observation workflow to handle complex queries by
reasoning about spatial context and user intent. As a reasoning workflow, it
should be somewhat autonomous, where predefined ground-truth reasoning paths do
not constrain the learning process. Furthermore, its architecture ought to be
unified yet flexible, enabling the model to perform diverse reasoning tasks
with distinct output formats through a single forward pass. Existing remote
sensing approaches fail to address these requirements, as they rely on
supervised fine-tuning paradigms that constrain the autonomy of reasoning. To
this end, we propose RemoteReasoner, a flexible and robust workflow for remote
sensing reasoning tasks. The design of RemoteReasoner integrates a multi-modal
large language model (MLLM) for interpreting user instructions and localizing
targets, together with task adaptation strategies that enable multi-granularity
output generation. In contrast to existing methods, our framework is trained
with reinforcement learning (RL) to endow the MLLM sufficient autonomy for
precise reasoning. At the inference stage, our adaptation strategies enable
diverse output formats at inference time without requiring task-specific
decoders or further fine-tuning. Preliminary experiments demonstrated that
RemoteReasoner achieves remarkable performance across multi-granularity
reasoning tasks, including region-level and pixel-level. Additionally, our
framework enables novel capabilities such as the contour extraction task beyond
the reach of existing reasoning pipelines.

Abstract: Generating realistic group interactions involving multiple characters remains
challenging due to increasing complexity as group size expands. While existing
conditional diffusion models incrementally generate motions by conditioning on
previously generated characters, they rely on single shared prompts, limiting
nuanced control and leading to overly simplified interactions. In this paper,
we introduce Person-Interaction Noise Optimization (PINO), a novel,
training-free framework designed for generating realistic and customizable
interactions among groups of arbitrary size. PINO decomposes complex group
interactions into semantically relevant pairwise interactions, and leverages
pretrained two-person interaction diffusion models to incrementally compose
group interactions. To ensure physical plausibility and avoid common artifacts
such as overlapping or penetration between characters, PINO employs
physics-based penalties during noise optimization. This approach allows precise
user control over character orientation, speed, and spatial relationships
without additional training. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that PINO
generates visually realistic, physically coherent, and adaptable multi-person
interactions suitable for diverse animation, gaming, and robotics applications.

Abstract: Detection of blood cells in microscopic images has become a major focus of

can be regarded as a feasible solution. In this study, we propose automatic
blood cell detection method (ABCD) based on an improved version of YOLOX, an
object detector, for detecting various types of blood cells, including white
blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. Firstly, we introduce the
Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) into the network's backbone to
enhance the efficiency of feature extraction. Furthermore, we introduce the
Adaptively Spatial Feature Fusion (ASFF) into the network's neck, which
optimizes the fusion of different features extracted from various stages of the
network. Finally, to speed up the model's convergence, we substitute the
Intersection over Union (IOU) loss function with the Complete Intersection over
Union (CIOU) loss function. The experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method is more effective than other existing methods for BCCD dataset.
Compared to the baseline algorithm, our method ABCD achieved 95.49 % mAP@0.5
and 86.89 % mAP@0.5-0.9, which are 2.8% and 23.41% higher, respectively, and
increased the detection speed by 2.9%, making it highly efficient for real-time
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 户外3D物体检测中，LiDAR和RGB数据的融合潜力巨大，但如何有效整合这些模态仍是一个开放性问题。

Method: 设计了三流结构的MuStD网络：LiDAR-PillarNet提取稀疏2D支柱特征，LiDAR-Height Compression生成鸟瞰图特征，3D Multimodal流通过UV映射和极坐标索引融合RGB和LiDAR特征。

Result: 在KITTI物体检测基准测试中取得了新的最优或竞争性结果，同时保持了高效性。

Conclusion: MuStD网络通过多模态特征融合，显著提升了户外3D物体检测的性能。

Abstract: Fusion of LiDAR and RGB data has the potential to enhance outdoor 3D object
detection accuracy. To address real-world challenges in outdoor 3D object
detection, fusion of LiDAR and RGB input has started gaining traction. However,
effective integration of these modalities for precise object detection task
still remains a largely open problem. To address that, we propose a MultiStream
Detection (MuStD) network, that meticulously extracts task-relevant information
from both data modalities. The network follows a three-stream structure. Its
LiDAR-PillarNet stream extracts sparse 2D pillar features from the LiDAR input
while the LiDAR-Height Compression stream computes Bird's-Eye View features. An
additional 3D Multimodal stream combines RGB and LiDAR features using UV
mapping and polar coordinate indexing. Eventually, the features containing
comprehensive spatial, textural and geometric information are carefully fused
and fed to a detection head for 3D object detection. Our extensive evaluation

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SIDE是一种新型方法，通过稀疏训练和剪枝方案提高原型部分的解释性，显著减少解释规模，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在高风险领域缺乏透明度，现有原型方法要么局限于细粒度任务，要么解释复杂。

Method: SIDE采用稀疏训练和剪枝方案，结合sigmoid激活函数，使每个类仅关联少量原型。

Result: SIDE在保持准确性的同时，将解释规模减少90%以上。

Conclusion: SIDE显著提升了原型解释的可理解性，适用于大规模数据集。

Abstract: Understanding the decisions made by deep neural networks is essential in
high-stakes domains such as medical imaging and autonomous driving. Yet, these
models often lack transparency, particularly in computer vision.
Prototypical-parts-based neural networks have emerged as a promising solution
by offering concept-level explanations. However, most are limited to
fine-grained classification tasks, with few exceptions such as InfoDisent.
InfoDisent extends prototypical models to large-scale datasets like ImageNet,
but produces complex explanations.
  We introduce Sparse Information Disentanglement for Explainability (SIDE), a
novel method that improves the interpretability of prototypical parts through a
dedicated training and pruning scheme that enforces sparsity. Combined with
sigmoid activations in place of softmax, this approach allows SIDE to associate
each class with only a small set of relevant prototypes. Extensive experiments
show that SIDE matches the accuracy of existing methods while reducing
explanation size by over $90\%$, substantially enhancing the understandability
of prototype-based explanations.

TL;DR: EffiComm是一个端到端框架，通过选择性传输和自适应网格减少技术，显著降低数据传输量（<40%），同时保持3D物体检测的高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决车辆间通信中传输原始点云或完整特征图导致的延迟和可扩展性问题。

Method: 采用两阶段减少管道：选择性传输（ST）修剪低效用区域，自适应网格减少（AGR）根据车辆角色和网络负载分配保留比例，并通过软门控混合专家（MoE）注意力层融合特征。

Result: 在OPV2V基准测试中，EffiComm达到0.84 mAP@0.7，每帧仅传输约1.5 MB，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: EffiComm展示了自适应学习通信在可扩展V2X感知中的价值。

Abstract: Collaborative perception allows connected vehicles to exchange sensor
information and overcome each vehicle's blind spots. Yet transmitting raw point
clouds or full feature maps overwhelms Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications,
causing latency and scalability problems. We introduce EffiComm, an end-to-end
framework that transmits less than 40% of the data required by prior art while
maintaining state-of-the-art 3D object detection accuracy. EffiComm operates on
Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) feature maps from any modality and applies a two-stage
reduction pipeline: (1) Selective Transmission (ST) prunes low-utility regions
with a confidence mask; (2) Adaptive Grid Reduction (AGR) uses a Graph Neural
Network (GNN) to assign vehicle-specific keep ratios according to role and
network load. The remaining features are fused with a soft-gated
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) attention layer, offering greater capacity and
specialization for effective feature integration. On the OPV2V benchmark,
EffiComm reaches 0.84 mAP@0.7 while sending only an average of approximately
1.5 MB per frame, outperforming previous methods on the accuracy-per-bit curve.
These results highlight the value of adaptive, learned communication for
scalable Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) perception.

Motivation: 现有手势生成研究主要关注节奏性手势，忽略了手势的语义上下文，导致生成的语义手势缺乏连贯性。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：首先通过向量量化变分自编码器学习运动先验，然后通过第二模块结合语音、文本语义和说话者身份生成手势，确保语义一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法在语音同步手势生成中实现了语义接地，显著提升了手势的语义相关性和表现力。

Abstract: Creating a virtual avatar with semantically coherent gestures that are
aligned with speech is a challenging task. Existing gesture generation research
mainly focused on generating rhythmic beat gestures, neglecting the semantic
context of the gestures. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for
semantic grounding in co-speech gesture generation that integrates semantic
information at both fine-grained and global levels. Our approach starts with
learning the motion prior through a vector-quantized variational autoencoder.
Built on this model, a second-stage module is applied to automatically generate
gestures from speech, text-based semantics and speaker identity that ensures
consistency between the semantic relevance of generated gestures and
co-occurring speech semantics through semantic coherence and relevance modules.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enhances the realism and
coherence of semantic gestures. Extensive experiments and user studies show
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across two benchmarks
in co-speech gesture generation in both objective and subjective metrics. The
qualitative results of our model, code, dataset and pre-trained models can be

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统ViT部署时需要为不同资源约束重新训练多个模型的耗时和能耗问题。

Result: 在多个基准测试中验证了EA-ViT的有效性和多功能性。

Conclusion: EA-ViT提供了一种高效且灵活的ViT部署解决方案。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as a foundational model in computer
vision, excelling in generalization and adaptation to downstream tasks.
However, deploying ViTs to support diverse resource constraints typically
requires retraining multiple, size-specific ViTs, which is both time-consuming
and energy-intensive. To address this issue, we propose an efficient ViT
adaptation framework that enables a single adaptation process to generate
multiple models of varying sizes for deployment on platforms with various
resource constraints. Our approach comprises two stages. In the first stage, we
enhance a pre-trained ViT with a nested elastic architecture that enables
structural flexibility across MLP expansion ratio, number of attention heads,
embedding dimension, and network depth. To preserve pre-trained knowledge and
ensure stable adaptation, we adopt a curriculum-based training strategy that
progressively increases elasticity. In the second stage, we design a
lightweight router to select submodels according to computational budgets and
downstream task demands. Initialized with Pareto-optimal configurations derived
via a customized NSGA-II algorithm, the router is then jointly optimized with
the backbone. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and versatility of EA-ViT. The code is available at

Motivation: 现有评估方法缺乏标准化、偏见意识和用户偏好考虑，LOTUS旨在解决这些问题。

Method: LOTUS通过综合评估描述质量、风险和偏见，并根据用户偏好定制标准。

Result: 分析显示，没有单一模型在所有标准上表现最佳，且描述细节与偏见风险相关。用户偏好影响最佳模型选择。

Conclusion: LOTUS为详细图像描述提供了全面评估框架，强调用户偏好的重要性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have transformed image captioning,
shifting from concise captions to detailed descriptions. We introduce LOTUS, a
leaderboard for evaluating detailed captions, addressing three main gaps in
existing evaluations: lack of standardized criteria, bias-aware assessments,
and user preference considerations. LOTUS comprehensively evaluates various
aspects, including caption quality (e.g., alignment, descriptiveness), risks
(\eg, hallucination), and societal biases (e.g., gender bias) while enabling
preference-oriented evaluations by tailoring criteria to diverse user
preferences. Our analysis of recent LVLMs reveals no single model excels across
all criteria, while correlations emerge between caption detail and bias risks.
Preference-oriented evaluations demonstrate that optimal model selection
depends on user priorities.

Conclusion: BEV-LLM在场景描述任务中具有竞争力，新数据集填补了现有基准的不足。

Abstract: Autonomous driving technology has the potential to transform transportation,
but its wide adoption depends on the development of interpretable and
transparent decision-making systems. Scene captioning, which generates natural
language descriptions of the driving environment, plays a crucial role in
enhancing transparency, safety, and human-AI interaction. We introduce BEV-LLM,
a lightweight model for 3D captioning of autonomous driving scenes. BEV-LLM
leverages BEVFusion to combine 3D LiDAR point clouds and multi-view images,
incorporating a novel absolute positional encoding for view-specific scene
descriptions. Despite using a small 1B parameter base model, BEV-LLM achieves
competitive performance on the nuCaption dataset, surpassing state-of-the-art
by up to 5\% in BLEU scores. Additionally, we release two new datasets - nuView
(focused on environmental conditions and viewpoints) and GroundView (focused on
object grounding) - to better assess scene captioning across diverse driving
scenarios and address gaps in current benchmarks, along with initial
benchmarking results demonstrating their effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自监督深度学习模型在CXR分类中因类不平衡导致的长尾类识别不准确的问题。

Method: 采用类加权机制，结合GMM聚类和Student t分布优化潜在空间分布，并使用度量损失调整嵌入。

Result: 在MIMIC-CXR-JPG数据集的40个类别中，零样本AUC得分平均提升7%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了长尾类的识别准确率，为CXR分类提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Chest radiography (CXR) plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of various
diseases. However, the inherent class imbalance in the distribution of clinical
findings presents a significant challenge for current self-supervised deep
learning models. These models often fail to accurately classify long-tailed
classes. Current Vision-Language models such as Contrastive Language Image
Pre-training (CLIP) models effectively model the manifold distribution of the
latent space, enabling high zero-shot classification accuracies. Although CLIP
performs well on most of the primary classes in the dataset, our work reveals
that its effectiveness decreases significantly for classes with a long-tailed
distribution. Our approach employs a class-weighting mechanism that directly
aligns with the distribution of classes within the latent space. This method
ensures a substantial improvement in overall classification performance, with
particular emphasis on enhancing the recognition and accuracy of rarely
observed classes. We accomplish this by applying Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)
clustering to the latent space. The subsequent clusters are further refined by
Student t-distribution, followed by a metric loss that utilizes the altered
embeddings. Our approach facilitates stable and adaptive clustering of the
features. This results in a notable average improvement of 7\% points in
zero-shot AUC scores across 40 classes in the MIMIC-CXR-JPG dataset from
previous SOTA models.

TL;DR: MAELRE提出了一种统一的、高效的Transformer架构，用于跨多种模态的长范围编码，通过结合令牌合并和注意力近似，显著降低了计算和内存开销。


<details>

Motivation: 解决现有长上下文处理技术在单设备上实现时的二次计算和内存复杂度问题，同时克服模态特定方法的局限性。

Method: MAELRE结合令牌合并和注意力近似，逐步合并令牌并在不同阶段切换注意力机制。

Result: 在多种模态的分类任务中，MAELRE在保持高精度的同时显著降低了计算成本。

Conclusion: MAELRE为跨模态长上下文处理提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: The long-context capability of recent large transformer models can be
surmised to rely on techniques such as attention/model parallelism, as well as
hardware-level optimizations. While these strategies allow input lengths to
scale to millions of tokens, they do not fundamentally mitigate the quadratic
computational and memory complexity of the core attention mechanism. In this
paper, we address the challenge of long-context processing on a single device
using generic implementations by reducing the quadratic memory footprint and
inference cost. Existing approaches to extend the context length for generic
single device implementations -- such as token merging and modified attentions
-- are often modality specific and attain a suboptimal tradeoff between
accuracy and efficiency. To overcome these limitations, we propose MAELRE
(Modality Agnostic Efficient Long Range Encoder), a unified and efficient
transformer architecture designed for long-range encoding across diverse
modalities. MAELRE integrates token merging with attention approximation,
progressively merging tokens at different stages of internal computational
blocks. It employs a lightweight attention approximation when the number of
tokens is large, and switches to standard dot-product attention as the sequence
becomes shorter through successive aggregation. We demonstrate that MAELRE
achieves superior accuracy while reducing computational cost compared to
existing long-context models on classification tasks spanning multiple
modalities, including text, time series, audio, and vision.

Result: 在合成和真实失真数据集上的实验表明DEFNet具有高效性和鲁棒性，并展示了其强大的泛化能力和适应性。

Conclusion: DEFNet通过多任务优化和不确定性估计技术显著提升了BIQA性能，适用于未知场景。

Abstract: Blind image quality assessment (BIQA) methods often incorporate auxiliary
tasks to improve performance. However, existing approaches face limitations due
to insufficient integration and a lack of flexible uncertainty estimation,
leading to suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose a
multitasks-based Deep Evidential Fusion Network (DEFNet) for BIQA, which
performs multitask optimization with the assistance of scene and distortion
type classification tasks. To achieve a more robust and reliable
representation, we design a novel trustworthy information fusion strategy. It
first combines diverse features and patterns across sub-regions to enhance
information richness, and then performs local-global information fusion by
balancing fine-grained details with coarse-grained context. Moreover, DEFNet
exploits advanced uncertainty estimation technique inspired by evidential
learning with the help of normal-inverse gamma distribution mixture. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and authentic distortion datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework. Additional evaluation
and analysis are carried out to highlight its strong generalization capability
and adaptability to previously unseen scenarios.

Result: 发现视觉语义高度集中于特定对象标记（移除这些标记会降低模型性能达92.6%），且中晚期层对对象和动作的时空语义有专门功能定位。

Conclusion: 研究为LVLMs的时空语义分析提供了机制性见解，为设计更鲁棒和可解释的模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: The processing mechanisms underlying language and image understanding in
large vision-language models (LVLMs) have been extensively studied. However,
the internal reasoning mechanisms of LVLMs for spatiotemporal understanding
remain poorly understood. In this work, we introduce a systematic,
circuit-based framework designed to investigate how spatiotemporal visual
semantics are represented and processed within these LVLMs. Specifically, our
framework comprises three circuits: visual auditing circuit, semantic tracing
circuit, and attention flow circuit. Through the lens of these circuits, we
discover that visual semantics are highly localized to specific object
tokens--removing these tokens can degrade model performance by up to 92.6%.
Furthermore, we identify that interpretable concepts of objects and actions
emerge and become progressively refined in the middle-to-late layers of LVLMs.
In contrary to the current works that solely focus on objects in one image, we
reveal that the middle-to-late layers of LVLMs exhibit specialized functional
localization for spatiotemporal semantics. Our findings offer significant
mechanistic insights into spatiotemporal semantics analysis of LVLMs, laying a
foundation for designing more robust and interpretable models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖LiDAR标注，限制了可扩展性，且无法利用大量众包数据进行自动标注。

Method: 采用Octree-based Gaussian Surfel表示法，分解场景为静态背景、地面和动态物体，分别优化建模。

Result: 在Waymo数据集上取得最先进的几何重建效果，并在Occ3D-Waymo和Occ3D-nuScenes上展示了零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: GS-Occ3D展示了基于视觉的大规模占用空间重建在自动驾驶感知中的潜力。

Abstract: Occupancy is crucial for autonomous driving, providing essential geometric
priors for perception and planning. However, existing methods predominantly
rely on LiDAR-based occupancy annotations, which limits scalability and
prevents leveraging vast amounts of potential crowdsourced data for
auto-labeling. To address this, we propose GS-Occ3D, a scalable vision-only
framework that directly reconstructs occupancy. Vision-only occupancy
reconstruction poses significant challenges due to sparse viewpoints, dynamic
scene elements, severe occlusions, and long-horizon motion. Existing
vision-based methods primarily rely on mesh representation, which suffer from
incomplete geometry and additional post-processing, limiting scalability. To
overcome these issues, GS-Occ3D optimizes an explicit occupancy representation
using an Octree-based Gaussian Surfel formulation, ensuring efficiency and
scalability. Additionally, we decompose scenes into static background, ground,
and dynamic objects, enabling tailored modeling strategies: (1) Ground is
explicitly reconstructed as a dominant structural element, significantly
improving large-area consistency; (2) Dynamic vehicles are separately modeled
to better capture motion-related occupancy patterns. Extensive experiments on
the Waymo dataset demonstrate that GS-Occ3D achieves state-of-the-art geometry
reconstruction results. By curating vision-only binary occupancy labels from
diverse urban scenes, we show their effectiveness for downstream occupancy
models on Occ3D-Waymo and superior zero-shot generalization on Occ3D-nuScenes.
It highlights the potential of large-scale vision-based occupancy
reconstruction as a new paradigm for autonomous driving perception. Project

Motivation: 传统方法如NeRF和3DGS在空间应用中受限，因其需要精确姿态和高计算成本。

Method: 使用CNN从单目图像生成粗略3D模型和姿态估计，用于初始化3DGS，减少训练迭代和图像需求。

Result: 即使姿态估计不精确，仍能学习高保真3D表示，训练成本降低至少一个数量级。

Conclusion: 该方法为空间应用中的新视角合成提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The advent of novel view synthesis techniques such as NeRF and 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) has enabled learning precise 3D models only from posed
monocular images. Although these methods are attractive, they hold two major
limitations that prevent their use in space applications: they require poses
during training, and have high computational cost at training and inference. To
address these limitations, this work contributes: (1) a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) based primitive initializer for 3DGS using monocular images; (2)
a pipeline capable of training with noisy or implicit pose estimates; and (3)
and analysis of initialization variants that reduce the training cost of
precise 3D models. A CNN takes a single image as input and outputs a coarse 3D
model represented as an assembly of primitives, along with the target's pose
relative to the camera. This assembly of primitives is then used to initialize
3DGS, significantly reducing the number of training iterations and input images
needed -- by at least an order of magnitude. For additional flexibility, the
CNN component has multiple variants with different pose estimation techniques.
This work performs a comparison between these variants, evaluating their
effectiveness for downstream 3DGS training under noisy or implicit pose
estimates. The results demonstrate that even with imperfect pose supervision,
the pipeline is able to learn high-fidelity 3D representations, opening the
door for the use of novel view synthesis in space applications.

Conclusion: 该方法高效且适用于实时应用，为机器人足球提供了一种可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Self-localization is essential in robot soccer, where accurate detection of
visual field features, such as lines and boundaries, is critical for reliable
pose estimation. This paper presents a lightweight and efficient method for
detecting soccer field lines using the ELSED algorithm, extended with a
classification step that analyzes RGB color transitions to identify lines
belonging to the field. We introduce a pipeline based on Particle Swarm
Optimization (PSO) for threshold calibration to optimize detection performance,
requiring only a small number of annotated samples. Our approach achieves
accuracy comparable to a state-of-the-art deep learning model while offering
higher processing speed, making it well-suited for real-time applications on
low-power robotic platforms.

Abstract: This paper presents DINO-SLAM, a DINO-informed design strategy to enhance
neural implicit (Neural Radiance Field -- NeRF) and explicit representations
(3D Gaussian Splatting -- 3DGS) in SLAM systems through more comprehensive
scene representations. Purposely, we rely on a Scene Structure Encoder (SSE)
that enriches DINO features into Enhanced DINO ones (EDINO) to capture
hierarchical scene elements and their structural relationships. Building upon
it, we propose two foundational paradigms for NeRF and 3DGS SLAM systems
integrating EDINO features. Our DINO-informed pipelines achieve superior
performance on the Replica, ScanNet, and TUM compared to state-of-the-art

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估GUI自动化代理在不同平台上的表现，并解决现有方法在效率和任务规划方面的不足。

Method: 提出MMBench-GUI基准，包含四个评估层级（GUI内容理解、元素定位、任务自动化和任务协作），并引入EQA指标衡量效率。

Result: 发现视觉定位对任务成功至关重要，模块化框架和任务规划能力显著提升性能，但所有模型在效率上存在冗余步骤问题。

Conclusion: 高效的GUI自动化需要精准定位、有效规划和早期停止策略，MMBench-GUI为未来研究提供了公开的基准和工具。

Abstract: We introduce MMBench-GUI, a hierarchical benchmark for evaluating GUI
automation agents across Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and Web
platforms. It comprises four levels: GUI Content Understanding, Element
Grounding, Task Automation, and Task Collaboration, covering essential skills
for GUI agents. In addition, we propose a novel Efficiency-Quality Area (EQA)
metric to assess GUI agent execution efficiency in online automation scenarios.
Through MMBench-GUI, we identify accurate visual grounding as a critical
determinant of overall task success, emphasizing the substantial benefits of
modular frameworks that integrate specialized grounding modules. Furthermore,
to achieve reliable GUI automation, an agent requires strong task planning and
cross-platform generalization abilities, with long-context memory, a broad
action space, and long-term reasoning playing a critical role. More important,
task efficiency remains a critically underexplored dimension, and all models
suffer from substantial inefficiencies, with excessive redundant steps even
when tasks are ultimately completed. The integration of precise localization,
effective planning, and early stopping strategies is indispensable to enable
truly efficient and scalable GUI automation. Our benchmark code, evaluation
data, and running environment will be publicly available at
https://github.com/open-compass/MMBench-GUI.

TL;DR: 提出了一种显式头发组合性的3D头部化身通用先验模型，解决了现有方法难以分离脸部和头发表示的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将脸部和头发视为不可分割的整体，忽略了其组合性，导致难以灵活支持3D脸部和发型交换等应用。

Method: 通过合成无头发数据集，分别学习脸部和头发的潜在空间，并利用组合性作为归纳偏置进行有效分离。

Result: 模型实现了脸部和头发组件的无缝转移，并支持少量单目捕捉数据微调生成高保真3D头部化身。

Conclusion: 该模型为灵活且可表达的3D化身生成提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: We present a universal prior model for 3D head avatars with explicit hair
compositionality. Existing approaches to build generalizable priors for 3D head
avatars often adopt a holistic modeling approach, treating the face and hair as
an inseparable entity. This overlooks the inherent compositionality of the
human head, making it difficult for the model to naturally disentangle face and
hair representations, especially when the dataset is limited. Furthermore, such
holistic models struggle to support applications like 3D face and hairstyle
swapping in a flexible and controllable manner. To address these challenges, we
introduce a prior model that explicitly accounts for the compositionality of
face and hair, learning their latent spaces separately. A key enabler of this
approach is our synthetic hairless data creation pipeline, which removes hair
from studio-captured datasets using estimated hairless geometry and texture
derived from a diffusion prior. By leveraging a paired dataset of hair and
hairless captures, we train disentangled prior models for face and hair,
incorporating compositionality as an inductive bias to facilitate effective
separation. Our model's inherent compositionality enables seamless transfer of
face and hair components between avatars while preserving identity.
Additionally, we demonstrate that our model can be fine-tuned in a few-shot
manner using monocular captures to create high-fidelity, hair-compositional 3D
head avatars for unseen subjects. These capabilities highlight the practical
applicability of our approach in real-world scenarios, paving the way for
flexible and expressive 3D avatar generation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种称为L2最优方法的新技术，用于估计X核成像中的灵敏度图，相比常用的RefPeak方法更准确。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究目的是解决X核成像中灵敏度图估计的问题，尤其是在目标核信号分布不均的情况下。

Method: 通过解决最小二乘问题估计灵敏度图，利用光谱、动态成像或多频激发中的多个估计值。

Result: L2最优方法在数值模型和实际脑、胰腺、心脏成像中表现出更高的准确性和信噪比。

Conclusion: L2最优方法能更有效地利用测量信息，提供更准确的灵敏度图估计。

Abstract: The purpose of this research is to estimate sensitivity maps when imaging
X-nuclei that may not have a significant presence throughout the field of view.
We propose to estimate the coil's sensitivities by solving a least-squares
problem where each row corresponds to an individual estimate of the sensitivity
for a given voxel. Multiple estimates come from the multiple bins of the
spectrum with spectroscopy, multiple times with dynamic imaging, or multiple
frequencies when utilizing spectral excitation. The method presented in this
manuscript, called the L2 optimal method, is compared to the commonly used
RefPeak method which uses the spectral bin with the highest energy to estimate
the sensitivity maps. The L2 optimal method yields more accurate sensitivity
maps when imaging a numerical phantom and is shown to yield a higher
signal-to-noise ratio when imaging the brain, pancreas, and heart with
hyperpolarized pyruvate as the contrast agent with hyperpolarized MRI. The L2
optimal method is able to better estimate the sensitivity by extracting more
information from the measurements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频超分辨率（VSR）方法存在时间动态建模不一致、高频细节恢复不足及缺乏4K超分辨率评估的问题，RealisVSR旨在解决这些挑战。

Method: 1）提出Consistency Preserved ControlNet（CPC）架构；2）引入High-Frequency Rectified Diffusion Loss（HR-Loss）；3）构建首个公开的4K VSR基准数据集RealisVideo-4K。

Result: 实验表明，RealisVSR在多个基准测试中表现优异，尤其在超高分辨率场景下，且仅需5-25%的训练数据量。

Conclusion: RealisVSR通过创新架构和损失函数，显著提升了视频超分辨率的性能，特别是在高频细节恢复和4K超分辨率任务上。

Abstract: Video Super-Resolution (VSR) has achieved significant progress through
diffusion models, effectively addressing the over-smoothing issues inherent in
GAN-based methods. Despite recent advances, three critical challenges persist
in VSR community: 1) Inconsistent modeling of temporal dynamics in foundational
models; 2) limited high-frequency detail recovery under complex real-world
degradations; and 3) insufficient evaluation of detail enhancement and 4K
super-resolution, as current methods primarily rely on 720P datasets with
inadequate details. To address these challenges, we propose RealisVSR, a
high-frequency detail-enhanced video diffusion model with three core
innovations: 1) Consistency Preserved ControlNet (CPC) architecture integrated
with the Wan2.1 video diffusion to model the smooth and complex motions and
suppress artifacts; 2) High-Frequency Rectified Diffusion Loss (HR-Loss)
combining wavelet decomposition and HOG feature constraints for texture
restoration; 3) RealisVideo-4K, the first public 4K VSR benchmark containing
1,000 high-definition video-text pairs. Leveraging the advanced spatio-temporal
guidance of Wan2.1, our method requires only 5-25% of the training data volume
compared to existing approaches. Extensive experiments on VSR benchmarks (REDS,
SPMCS, UDM10, YouTube-HQ, VideoLQ, RealisVideo-720P) demonstrate our
superiority, particularly in ultra-high-resolution scenarios.

Abstract: Pneumonia remains one of the leading causes of death among children
worldwide, underscoring a critical need for fast and accurate diagnostic tools.
In this paper, we propose an interpretable deep learning model on Residual

X-rays. We enhance interpretability through Bayesian Gradient-weighted Class
Activation Mapping (BayesGrad-CAM), which quantifies uncertainty in visual
explanations, and which offers spatial locations accountable for the
decision-making process of the model. Our ResNet-50 model, trained on a large
paediatric chest X-rays dataset, achieves high classification accuracy
(95.94%), AUC-ROC (98.91%), and Cohen's Kappa (0.913), accompanied by
clinically meaningful visual explanations. Our findings demonstrate that high
performance and interpretability are not only achievable but critical for
clinical AI deployment.

Conclusion: RegScore为临床回归任务提供了透明且可解释的方法，有助于更可信的决策。

Abstract: Scoring systems are widely adopted in medical applications for their inherent
simplicity and transparency, particularly for classification tasks involving
tabular data. In this work, we introduce RegScore, a novel, sparse, and
interpretable scoring system specifically designed for regression tasks. Unlike
conventional scoring systems constrained to integer-valued coefficients,
RegScore leverages beam search and k-sparse ridge regression to relax these
restrictions, thus enhancing predictive performance. We extend RegScore to
bimodal deep learning by integrating tabular data with medical images. We
utilize the classification token from the TIP (Tabular Image Pretraining)
transformer to generate Personalized Linear Regression parameters and a
Personalized RegScore, enabling individualized scoring. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of RegScore by estimating mean Pulmonary Artery Pressure using
tabular data and further refine these estimates by incorporating cardiac MRI
images. Experimental results show that RegScore and its personalized bimodal
extensions achieve performance comparable to, or better than, state-of-the-art
black-box models. Our method provides a transparent and interpretable approach
for regression tasks in clinical settings, promoting more informed and
trustworthy decision-making. We provide our code at

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in automated
Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) analysis. However, the efficacy of these
models is highly dependent on the availability of high-quality, artifact-free
images. In clinical practice, CMR acquisitions are frequently degraded by
respiratory motion, yet the robustness of deep learning models against such
artifacts remains an underexplored problem. To promote research in this domain,
we organized the MICCAI CMRxMotion challenge. We curated and publicly released
a dataset of 320 CMR cine series from 40 healthy volunteers who performed
specific breathing protocols to induce a controlled spectrum of motion
artifacts. The challenge comprised two tasks: 1) automated image quality
assessment to classify images based on motion severity, and 2) robust
myocardial segmentation in the presence of motion artifacts. A total of 22
algorithms were submitted and evaluated on the two designated tasks. This paper
presents a comprehensive overview of the challenge design and dataset, reports
the evaluation results for the top-performing methods, and further investigates
the impact of motion artifacts on five clinically relevant biomarkers. All

Motivation: 糖尿病视网膜病变（DR）的自动分类对临床治疗至关重要，但数据不平衡问题限制了深度学习模型的泛化能力。

Method: 采用基于注意力机制的深度学习模型，结合MobileNetV3-small、EfficientNet-b0和DenseNet-169作为主干架构，引入GAB和CAB解决数据不平衡。

Result: 在APTOS和EYEPACS数据集上，DenseNet-169分别达到83.20%和75.43%的准确率，MobileNetV3-small和EfficientNet-b0表现次之。F1-score为82.0%，kappa分数为88.2%。

Conclusion: 所提方法在DR分类中性能优异，与现有方法相当，且MobileNetV3-small参数较少，适合实际应用。

Abstract: Automatic classification of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) can assist
ophthalmologists in devising personalized treatment plans, making it a critical
component of clinical practice. However, imbalanced data distribution in the
dataset becomes a bottleneck in the generalization of deep learning models
trained for DR classification. In this work, we combine global attention block
(GAB) and category attention block (CAB) into the deep learning model, thus
effectively overcoming the imbalanced data distribution problem in DR
classification. Our proposed approach is based on an attention mechanism-based
deep learning model that employs three pre-trained networks, namely,
MobileNetV3-small, Efficientnet-b0, and DenseNet-169 as the backbone
architecture. We evaluate the proposed method on two publicly available
datasets of retinal fundoscopy images for DR. Experimental results show that on
the APTOS dataset, the DenseNet-169 yielded 83.20% mean accuracy, followed by
the MobileNetV3-small and EfficientNet-b0, which yielded 82% and 80%
accuracies, respectively. On the EYEPACS dataset, the EfficientNet-b0 yielded a
mean accuracy of 80%, while the DenseNet-169 and MobileNetV3-small yielded
75.43% and 76.68% accuracies, respectively. In addition, we also compute the
F1-score of 82.0%, precision of 82.1%, sensitivity of 83.0%, specificity of
95.5%, and a kappa score of 88.2% for the experiments. Moreover, in our work,
the MobileNetV3-small has 1.6 million parameters on the APTOS dataset and 0.90
million parameters on the EYEPACS dataset, which is comparatively less than
other methods. The proposed approach achieves competitive performance that is
at par with recently reported works on DR classification.

Abstract: Purpose: Accurate tumor segmentation is vital for adaptive radiation therapy
(ART) but remains time-consuming and user-dependent. Segment Anything Model 2
(SAM2) shows promise for prompt-based segmentation but struggles with tumor
accuracy. We propose prior knowledge-based augmentation strategies to enhance
SAM2 for ART.
  Methods: Two strategies were introduced to improve SAM2: (1) using prior MR
images and annotations as contextual inputs, and (2) improving prompt
robustness via random bounding box expansion and mask erosion/dilation. The
resulting model, SAM2-Aug, was fine-tuned and tested on the One-Seq-Liver
dataset (115 MRIs from 31 liver cancer patients), and evaluated without
retraining on Mix-Seq-Abdomen (88 MRIs, 28 patients) and Mix-Seq-Brain (86
MRIs, 37 patients).
  Results: SAM2-Aug outperformed convolutional, transformer-based, and
prompt-driven models across all datasets, achieving Dice scores of 0.86(liver),
0.89(abdomen), and 0.90(brain). It demonstrated strong generalization across
tumor types and imaging sequences, with improved performance in
boundary-sensitive metrics.
  Conclusions: Incorporating prior images and enhancing prompt diversity
significantly boosts segmentation accuracy and generalizability. SAM2-Aug
offers a robust, efficient solution for tumor segmentation in ART. Code and

Motivation: 解决传统方法依赖全采样训练数据的问题，实现从高度欠采样数据中直接重建3D实时CMR。

Method: 开发了ML-DIP框架，使用独立神经网络分别建模空间图像内容和时间变形场，直接从欠采样k空间数据优化重建。

Result: 在数字模型和人体实验中，ML-DIP实现了高信噪比和结构相似性，功能测量与2D cine相当，图像质量优于5D-Cine。

Conclusion: ML-DIP通过从欠采样数据学习低秩时空表示，实现了高质量3D实时CMR重建，无需外部全采样数据集。

Abstract: Purpose: To develop a reconstruction framework for 3D real-time cine
cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) from highly undersampled data without
requiring fully sampled training data.
  Methods: We developed a multi-dynamic low-rank deep image prior (ML-DIP)
framework that models spatial image content and temporal deformation fields
using separate neural networks. These networks are optimized per scan to
reconstruct the dynamic image series directly from undersampled k-space data.
ML-DIP was evaluated on (i) a 3D cine digital phantom with simulated premature
ventricular contractions (PVCs), (ii) ten healthy subjects (including two
scanned during both rest and exercise), and (iii) five patients with PVCs.
Phantom results were assessed using peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and
structural similarity index measure (SSIM). In vivo performance was evaluated
by comparing left-ventricular function quantification (against 2D real-time
cine) and image quality (against 2D real-time cine and binning-based 5D-Cine).
  Results: In the phantom study, ML-DIP achieved PSNR > 29 dB and SSIM > 0.90
for scan times as short as two minutes, while recovering cardiac motion,
respiratory motion, and PVC events. In healthy subjects, ML-DIP yielded
functional measurements comparable to 2D cine and higher image quality than
5D-Cine, including during exercise with high heart rates and bulk motion. In
PVC patients, ML-DIP preserved beat-to-beat variability and reconstructed
irregular beats, whereas 5D-Cine showed motion artifacts and information loss
due to binning.
  Conclusion: ML-DIP enables high-quality 3D real-time CMR with acceleration
factors exceeding 1,000 by learning low-rank spatial and temporal
representations from undersampled data, without relying on external fully
sampled training datasets.

Result: 方法将重建时间缩短两个数量级，图像质量更优，并支持多光谱重建。

Conclusion: 学习型单像素荧光显微镜有望推动诊断和生物研究，以低成本实现多光谱成像。

Abstract: Single-pixel imaging has emerged as a key technique in fluorescence
microscopy, where fast acquisition and reconstruction are crucial. In this
context, images are reconstructed from linearly compressed measurements. In
practice, total variation minimisation is still used to reconstruct the image
from noisy measurements of the inner product between orthogonal sampling
pattern vectors and the original image data. However, data can be leveraged to
learn the measurement vectors and the reconstruction process, thereby enhancing
compression, reconstruction quality, and speed. We train an autoencoder through
self-supervision to learn an encoder (or measurement matrix) and a decoder. We
then test it on physically acquired multispectral and intensity data. During
acquisition, the learned encoder becomes part of the physical device. Our
approach can enhance single-pixel imaging in fluorescence microscopy by
reducing reconstruction time by two orders of magnitude, achieving superior
image quality, and enabling multispectral reconstructions. Ultimately, learned
single-pixel fluorescence microscopy could advance diagnosis and biological
research, providing multispectral imaging at a fraction of the cost.

Abstract: We propose image-to-image diffusion models that are designed to enhance the
realism and details of generated brain images by introducing sharp edges, fine
textures, subtle anatomical features, and imaging noise. Generative models have
been widely adopted in the biomedical domain, especially in image generation
applications. Latent diffusion models achieve state-of-the-art results in
generating brain MRIs. However, due to latent compression, generated images
from these models are overly smooth, lacking fine anatomical structures and
scan acquisition noise that are typically seen in real images. This work
formulates the realism enhancing and detail adding process as image-to-image
diffusion models, which refines the quality of LDM-generated images. We employ
commonly used metrics like FID and LPIPS for image realism assessment.
Furthermore, we introduce new metrics to demonstrate the realism of images
generated by RealDeal in terms of image noise distribution, sharpness, and
texture.

Abstract: Brachytherapy involves bringing a radioactive source near tumor tissue using
implanted needles. Image-guided brachytherapy planning requires amongst others,
the reconstruction of the needles. Manually annotating these needles on patient
images can be a challenging and time-consuming task for medical professionals.
For automatic needle reconstruction, a two-stage pipeline is commonly adopted,
comprising a segmentation stage followed by a post-processing stage. While deep
learning models are effective for segmentation, their results often contain
errors. No currently existing post-processing technique is robust to all
possible segmentation errors. We therefore propose adaptations to existing
post-processing techniques mainly aimed at dealing with segmentation errors and
thereby improving the reconstruction accuracy. Experiments on a prostate cancer
dataset, based on MRI scans annotated by medical professionals, demonstrate
that our proposed adaptations can help to effectively manage segmentation
errors, with the best adapted post-processing technique achieving median
needle-tip and needle-bottom point localization errors of $1.07$ (IQR $\pm
1.04$) mm and $0.43$ (IQR $\pm 0.46$) mm, respectively, and median shaft error
of $0.75$ (IQR $\pm 0.69$) mm with 0 false positive and 0 false negative
needles on a test set of 261 needles.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种双路径学习（DPL）模型，通过结合噪声和上下文信息，有效去噪医学图像，并在多模态和多种噪声类型下表现出鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像中的噪声会降低图像质量，影响诊断效果。现有方法通常仅针对单一模态或噪声类型，缺乏通用性。

Method: 提出DPL模型，整合噪声特征和图像上下文信息，通过双路径学习实现去噪。

Result: DPL在多种模态和噪声类型下表现优于基线UNet，PSNR提升3.35%。

Conclusion: DPL是一种通用且鲁棒的医学图像去噪方法，适用于多种场景。

Abstract: Medical imaging plays a critical role in modern healthcare, enabling
clinicians to accurately diagnose diseases and develop effective treatment
plans. However, noise, often introduced by imaging devices, can degrade image
quality, leading to misinterpretation and compromised clinical outcomes.
Existing denoising approaches typically rely either on noise characteristics or
on contextual information from the image. Moreover, they are commonly developed
and evaluated for a single imaging modality and noise type. Motivated by Geng
et.al CNCL, which integrates both noise and context, this study introduces a
Dual-Pathway Learning (DPL) model architecture that effectively denoises
medical images by leveraging both sources of information and fusing them to
generate the final output. DPL is evaluated across multiple imaging modalities
and various types of noise, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability.
DPL improves PSNR by 3.35% compared to the baseline UNet when evaluated on
Gaussian noise and trained across all modalities. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 慢性阻塞性肺病（COPD）患者的肺血管准确分割和量化对疾病分析至关重要，尤其是小血管。

Method: 采用教师-学生模型的自训练框架，通过交互式标注获取高质量数据，利用教师模型生成伪标签，训练学生模型，并迭代优化。

Result: 在125名COPD患者的非增强CT扫描上测试，Semi2方法将血管分割精度提高了2.3%，达到90.3%。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了肺血管分割性能，还可用于COPD分析，代码已开源。

Abstract: Background: It is fundamental for accurate segmentation and quantification of
the pulmonary vessel, particularly smaller vessels, from computed tomography
(CT) images in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients.
Objective: The aim of this study was to segment the pulmonary vasculature using
a semi-supervised method. Methods: In this study, a self-training framework is
proposed by leveraging a teacher-student model for the segmentation of
pulmonary vessels. First, the high-quality annotations are acquired in the
in-house data by an interactive way. Then, the model is trained in the
semi-supervised way. A fully supervised model is trained on a small set of
labeled CT images, yielding the teacher model. Following this, the teacher
model is used to generate pseudo-labels for the unlabeled CT images, from which
reliable ones are selected based on a certain strategy. The training of the
student model involves these reliable pseudo-labels. This training process is
iteratively repeated until an optimal performance is achieved. Results:
Extensive experiments are performed on non-enhanced CT scans of 125 COPD
patients. Quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that the proposed
method, Semi2, significantly improves the precision of vessel segmentation by
2.3%, achieving a precision of 90.3%. Further, quantitative analysis is
conducted in the pulmonary vessel of COPD, providing insights into the
differences in the pulmonary vessel across different severity of the disease.
Conclusion: The proposed method can not only improve the performance of
pulmonary vascular segmentation, but can also be applied in COPD analysis. The
code will be made available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在利用长距离依赖和不同编码步骤的多样化上下文信息方面效率不足，HPCM旨在解决这一问题。

Method: HPCM采用分层编码计划逐步建模多尺度潜在变量的上下文依赖，并提出渐进上下文融合机制整合历史上下文信息。

Result: 实验表明，HPCM在率失真性能上达到最优，并在压缩性能和计算复杂度之间取得更好平衡。

Conclusion: HPCM通过分层和渐进机制有效提升了上下文建模效率，为图像压缩提供了新思路。

Abstract: Context modeling is essential in learned image compression for accurately
estimating the distribution of latents. While recent advanced methods have
expanded context modeling capacity, they still struggle to efficiently exploit
long-range dependency and diverse context information across different coding
steps. In this paper, we introduce a novel Hierarchical Progressive Context
Model (HPCM) for more efficient context information acquisition. Specifically,
HPCM employs a hierarchical coding schedule to sequentially model the
contextual dependencies among latents at multiple scales, which enables more
efficient long-range context modeling. Furthermore, we propose a progressive
context fusion mechanism that incorporates contextual information from previous
coding steps into the current step, effectively exploiting diverse contextual
information. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance and strikes a better balance
between compression performance and computational complexity. The code is

Abstract: In medical imaging, generative models are increasingly relied upon for two
distinct but equally critical tasks: reconstruction, where the goal is to
restore medical imaging (usually inverse problems like inpainting or
superresolution), and generation, where synthetic data is created to augment
datasets or carry out counterfactual analysis. Despite shared architecture and
learning frameworks, they prioritize different goals: generation seeks high
perceptual quality and diversity, while reconstruction focuses on data fidelity
and faithfulness. In this work, we introduce a "generative model zoo" and
systematically analyze how modern latent diffusion models and autoregressive
models navigate the reconstruction-generation spectrum. We benchmark a suite of
generative models across representative cardiac medical imaging tasks, focusing
on image inpainting with varying masking ratios and sampling strategies, as
well as unconditional image generation. Our findings show that diffusion models
offer superior perceptual quality for unconditional generation but tend to
hallucinate as masking ratios increase, whereas autoregressive models maintain
stable perceptual performance across masking levels, albeit with generally
lower fidelity.

Abstract: Mammography is the most commonly used imaging modality for breast cancer
screening, driving an increasing demand for deep-learning techniques to support
large-scale analysis. However, the development of accurate and robust methods
is often limited by insufficient data availability and a lack of diversity in
lesion characteristics. While generative models offer a promising solution for
data synthesis, current approaches often fail to adequately emphasize
lesion-specific features and their relationships with surrounding tissues. In
this paper, we propose Gated Conditional Diffusion Model (GCDM), a novel
framework designed to jointly synthesize holistic mammogram images and
localized lesions. GCDM is built upon a latent denoising diffusion framework,
where the noised latent image is concatenated with a soft mask embedding that
represents breast, lesion, and their transitional regions, ensuring anatomical
coherence between them during the denoising process. To further emphasize
lesion-specific features, GCDM incorporates a gated conditioning branch that
guides the denoising process by dynamically selecting and fusing the most
relevant radiomic and geometric properties of lesions, effectively capturing
their interplay. Experimental results demonstrate that GCDM achieves precise
control over small lesion areas while enhancing the realism and diversity of
synthesized mammograms. These advancements position GCDM as a promising tool
for clinical applications in mammogram synthesis. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 论文研究了ULS23分割模型在纵向数据中的表现，发现其因扫描注册错误和病灶中心假设而性能下降，提出需要设计端到端的纵向分析模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纵向病灶分析对肿瘤治疗至关重要，但现有自动化工具在时间一致性上表现不佳。

Method: 使用公开临床数据集评估ULS23模型在基线及随访CT扫描中的分割和跟踪能力，并通过实验人为偏移病灶中心以测试模型鲁棒性。

Result: 模型性能高度依赖病灶中心假设，偏移时分割准确性显著下降。

Conclusion: 需从单一时间点模型转向专为纵向分析设计的端到端模型。

Abstract: Longitudinal lesion analysis is crucial for oncological care, yet automated
tools often struggle with temporal consistency. While universal lesion
segmentation models have advanced, they are typically designed for single time
points. This paper investigates the performance of the ULS23 segmentation model
in a longitudinal context. Using a public clinical dataset of baseline and
follow-up CT scans, we evaluated the model's ability to segment and track
lesions over time. We identified two critical, interconnected failure modes: a
sharp degradation in segmentation quality in follow-up cases due to inter-scan
registration errors, and a subsequent breakdown of the lesion correspondence
process. To systematically probe this vulnerability, we conducted a controlled
experiment where we artificially displaced the input volume relative to the
true lesion center. Our results demonstrate that the model's performance is
highly dependent on its assumption of a centered lesion; segmentation accuracy
collapses when the lesion is sufficiently displaced. These findings reveal a
fundamental limitation of applying single-timepoint models to longitudinal
data. We conclude that robust oncological tracking requires a paradigm shift
away from cascading single-purpose tools towards integrated, end-to-end models
inherently designed for temporal analysis.

TL;DR: NerT-CA提出了一种结合神经和张量表示的混合方法，用于加速稀疏视图X射线冠状动脉造影的4D重建，显著提升了训练速度和重建精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决冠状动脉3D和4D重建中的挑战，如血管结构稀疏、背景与血管区分困难、稀疏视图和扫描内运动，同时避免现有方法依赖耗时手动或易出错自动分割的问题。

Method: 结合低秩静态重建的快速张量场和动态稀疏重建的神经场，分解CA场景为低秩和稀疏组件。

Result: 在训练时间和重建精度上优于现有方法，仅需三个血管造影视图即可实现合理重建。

Conclusion: NerT-CA为稀疏视图CA的4D重建提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) and dynamic 3D+time (4D) reconstruction of coronary
arteries from X-ray coronary angiography (CA) has the potential to improve
clinical procedures. However, there are multiple challenges to be addressed,
most notably, blood-vessel structure sparsity, poor background and blood vessel
distinction, sparse-views, and intra-scan motion. State-of-the-art
reconstruction approaches rely on time-consuming manual or error-prone
automatic segmentations, limiting clinical usability. Recently, approaches
based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown promise for automatic
reconstructions in the sparse-view setting. However, they suffer from long
training times due to their dependence on MLP-based representations. We propose
NerT-CA, a hybrid approach of Neural and Tensorial representations for
accelerated 4D reconstructions with sparse-view CA. Building on top of the
previous NeRF-based work, we model the CA scene as a decomposition of low-rank
and sparse components, utilizing fast tensorial fields for low-rank static
reconstruction and neural fields for dynamic sparse reconstruction. Our
approach outperforms previous works in both training time and reconstruction
accuracy, yielding reasonable reconstructions from as few as three angiogram
views. We validate our approach quantitatively and qualitatively on
representative 4D phantom datasets.

Conclusion: 通过简单规则和代理交互，实现了逼真且可扩展的城市生成模型。

Abstract: We propose a method to procedurally generate a familiar yet complex human
artifact: the city. We are not trying to reproduce existing cities, but to
generate artificial cities that are convincing and plausible by capturing
developmental behavior. In addition, our results are meant to build upon
themselves, such that they ought to look compelling at any point along the
transition from village to metropolis. Our approach largely focuses upon land
usage and building distribution for creating realistic city environments,
whereas previous attempts at city modeling have mainly focused on populating
road networks. Finally, we want our model to be self automated to the point
that the only necessary input is a terrain description, but other high-level
and low-level parameters can be specified to support artistic contributions.
With the aid of agent based simulation we are generating a system of agents and
behaviors that interact with one another through their effects upon a simulated
environment. Our philosophy is that as each agent follows a simple behavioral
rule set, a more complex behavior will tend to emerge out of the interactions
between the agents and their differing rule sets. By confining our model to a
set of simple rules for each class of agents, we hope to make our model
extendible not only in regard to the types of structures that are produced, but
also in describing the social and cultural influences prevalent in all cities

Conclusion: TiVy为大规模时间序列数据提供了高效、清晰的探索工具。

Abstract: Visualizing multiple time series presents fundamental tradeoffs between
scalability and visual clarity. Time series capture the behavior of many
large-scale real-world processes, from stock market trends to urban activities.
Users often gain insights by visualizing them as line charts, juxtaposing or
superposing multiple time series to compare them and identify trends and
patterns. However, existing representations struggle with scalability: when
covering long time spans, leading to visual clutter from too many small
multiples or overlapping lines. We propose TiVy, a new algorithm that
summarizes time series using sequential patterns. It transforms the series into
a set of symbolic sequences based on subsequence visual similarity using
Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), then constructs a disjoint grouping of similar
subsequences based on the frequent sequential patterns. The grouping result, a
visual summary of time series, provides uncluttered superposition with fewer
small multiples. Unlike common clustering techniques, TiVy extracts similar
subsequences (of varying lengths) aligned in time. We also present an
interactive time series visualization that renders large-scale time series in
real-time. Our experimental evaluation shows that our algorithm (1) extracts
clear and accurate patterns when visualizing time series data, (2) achieves a
significant speed-up (1000X) compared to a straightforward DTW clustering. We
also demonstrate the efficiency of our approach to explore hidden structures in
massive time series data in two usage scenarios.

Abstract: The propagation of waves through the marginal ice zone (MIZ) and deeper into
pack ice is a key phenomenon that influences the breakup and drift of sea ice.
When waves in ice propagate through a solid, non-cracked, thick enough sea ice
cover, significant flexural elastic effects can be present in the dispersion
relation. This results in a dispersion relation that opens up for 3-wave
interactions, also known as wave triads.
  Here, we report the observation of high-frequency spectral peaks in the power
spectral density of waves in ice spectra. We show, in two timeseries datasets,
that the presence of these high-frequency peaks is accompanied by high values
for the spectral bicoherence. This is a signature that the high-frequency peak
is phase-locked with frequency components in the main spectral energy peak, and
a necessary condition for nonlinear coupling to take place. Moreover, we show
for a timeseries dataset that includes several closely located sensors that the
dispersion relation recovered from a cross-spectrum analysis is compatible with
the possible existence of wave triads at the same frequencies for which the
bicoherence peak is observed. In addition to these observations in timeseries
datasets, we show that similar high-frequency peaks are observed from
additional, independent datasets of waves in ice power spectrum densities
transmitted over iridium from autonomous buoys.
  These results suggest that nonlinear energy transfers between wave in ice
spectral components are likely to occur in some waves and sea ice conditions.
This may enable redistribution of energy from weakly damped low-frequency waves
to more strongly attenuated higher-frequency spectral components, which can
contribute to energy dissipation in the ice.

Conclusion: 提出的非线性悬浮函数模型能更准确地描述超指数保留曲线，为胶体和纳米悬浮液传输提供了更优的理论工具。

Abstract: Hyper-exponential retention profiles (HERPs) are often observed during
laboratory tests on colloidal and nano-suspension transport in porous media.
The aim of this work is an extension of the traditional model for suspended
particle transport (deep bed filtration) to match HERPs. Interpreting particle
capture in the framework of active mass law for the "chemical reaction"
particle-rock, we substitute suspension concentration in the traditional
expression for capture rate by non-linear "activity" function, called the
suspension function. The non-linear suspension function is derived from
Margules' activity model for excess Gibbs free energy. This suspension function
is shown to match that derived from multicomponent colloidal transport with
good agreement, despite having one less unknown parameter. Empirical formulae
are presented to convert between the two unknown parameters of the
multicomponent model and the Margules exponent. Comparison between the new
model and laboratory coreflooding data shows good agreement, even in cases with
distinctly hyper-exponential retention profiles, where the classical model
fails to reproduce the laboratory data.

Conclusion: RoadDiff框架为精细交通管理提供了一种高效且成本效益高的解决方案，解决了车道级交通数据获取的瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Fine-grained traffic management and prediction are fundamental to key
applications such as autonomous driving, lane change guidance, and traffic
signal control. However, obtaining lane-level traffic data has become a
critical bottleneck for data-driven models due to limitations in the types and
number of sensors and issues with the accuracy of tracking algorithms. To
address this, we propose the Fine-grained Road Traffic Inference (FRTI) task,
which aims to generate more detailed lane-level traffic information using
limited road data, providing a more energy-efficient and cost-effective
solution for precise traffic management. This task is abstracted as the first
scene of the spatio-temporal graph node generation problem. We designed a
two-stage framework--RoadDiff--to solve the FRTI task. solve the FRTI task.
This framework leverages the Road-Lane Correlation Autoencoder-Decoder and the
Lane Diffusion Module to fully utilize the limited spatio-temporal dependencies
and distribution relationships of road data to accurately infer fine-grained
lane traffic states. Based on existing research, we designed several baseline
models with the potential to solve the FRTI task and conducted extensive
experiments on six datasets representing different road conditions to validate
the effectiveness of the RoadDiff model in addressing the FRTI task. The

TL;DR: OS-MAP是一个用于日常计算机自动化任务的基准测试，通过五级自动化和需求层次结构评估代理能力，揭示当前代理在高级任务中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试未能考虑任务异质性和代理能力与实际用户需求的匹配，阻碍了针对性能力开发和研究成果的实际应用。

Method: OS-MAP设计了416个现实任务，分布在15个应用中，通过五级自动化和需求层次结构两个维度评估代理。

Result: 实验表明，即使最先进的代理在涉及感知、推理和协调的高级任务中表现不佳。

Conclusion: OS-MAP为计算机代理的研究和部署提供了结构化评估框架，揭示了当前技术的局限性。

Abstract: Computer-using agents have shown strong potential to boost human productivity
and enable new application forms across platforms. While recent advances have
led to usable applications, existing benchmarks fail to account for the
internal task heterogeneity and the corresponding agent capabilities, as well
as their alignment with actual user demands-hindering both targeted capability
development and the reliable transition of research progress into practical
deployment. To bridge the gap, we present OS-MAP, a benchmark for daily
computer-using automation that organizes its 416 realistic tasks across 15
applications along two key dimensions: a five-level taxonomy of automation and
a generalization scope derived from a real-world user demand hierarchy. To
enable fine-grained analysis of required capabilities and alignment with
real-world scenarios, OS-MAP evaluates agents along two dimensions: automation
level across a five-level taxonomy, and generalization scope across a demand
hierarchy. This design captures varying levels of required agent autonomy and
generalization, forming a performance-generalization evaluation matrix for
structured and comprehensive assessment. Experiments show that even
State-of-the-Art agents with VLM backbones struggle with higher-level tasks
involving perception, reasoning, and coordination-highlighting the need for a
deeper understanding of current strengths and limitations to drive the future
progress in computer-using agents research and deployment. All code,
environments, baselines, and data are publicly available at

TL;DR: PhysDrive是一个大规模多模态数据集，用于无接触车内生理监测，覆盖多种驾驶条件和生理信号，旨在推动驾驶员监测研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有远程生理监测数据集规模小、多样性不足，无法满足真实驾驶场景的需求。

Method: PhysDrive收集了48名驾驶员的多模态数据（RGB、近红外摄像头、毫米波雷达）和六种同步生理信号（ECG、BVP等），涵盖多种驾驶条件。

Result: 数据集为信号处理和深度学习方法提供了全面基准，并开源了代码。

Conclusion: PhysDrive将成为多模态驾驶员监测和智能座舱系统研究的基础资源。

Abstract: Robust and unobtrusive in-vehicle physiological monitoring is crucial for
ensuring driving safety and user experience. While remote physiological
measurement (RPM) offers a promising non-invasive solution, its translation to
real-world driving scenarios is critically constrained by the scarcity of
comprehensive datasets. Existing resources are often limited in scale, modality
diversity, the breadth of biometric annotations, and the range of captured
conditions, thereby omitting inherent real-world challenges in driving. Here,
we present PhysDrive, the first large-scale multimodal dataset for contactless
in-vehicle physiological sensing with dedicated consideration on various
modality settings and driving factors. PhysDrive collects data from 48 drivers,
including synchronized RGB, near-infrared camera, and raw mmWave radar data,
accompanied with six synchronized ground truths (ECG, BVP, Respiration, HR, RR,
and SpO2). It covers a wide spectrum of naturalistic driving conditions,
including driver motions, dynamic natural light, vehicle types, and road
conditions. We extensively evaluate both signal-processing and deep-learning
methods on PhysDrive, establishing a comprehensive benchmark across all
modalities, and release full open-source code with compatibility for mainstream
public toolboxes. We envision PhysDrive will serve as a foundational resource
and accelerate research on multimodal driver monitoring and smart-cockpit
systems.

TL;DR: Perpetua是一种用于建模半静态特征动态的方法，能够结合先验知识、跟踪多假设并适应变化，预测未来特征状态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂动态环境中，机器人系统需要处理环境变化，现有算法无法有效预测动态特征的未来状态。

Method: 通过混合“持久性”和“出现性”滤波器，在贝叶斯框架中建模特征消失或重现的概率。

Result: 实验表明，Perpetua在模拟和真实数据中比类似方法更准确，且具有在线适应性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Perpetua是一种高效、可扩展、通用的方法，适用于动态环境中的特征状态预测。

Abstract: Many robotic systems require extended deployments in complex, dynamic
environments. In such deployments, parts of the environment may change between
subsequent robot observations. Most robotic mapping or environment modeling
algorithms are incapable of representing dynamic features in a way that enables
predicting their future state. Instead, they opt to filter certain state
observations, either by removing them or some form of weighted averaging. This
paper introduces Perpetua, a method for modeling the dynamics of semi-static
features. Perpetua is able to: incorporate prior knowledge about the dynamics
of the feature if it exists, track multiple hypotheses, and adapt over time to
enable predicting of future feature states. Specifically, we chain together
mixtures of "persistence" and "emergence" filters to model the probability that
features will disappear or reappear in a formal Bayesian framework. The
approach is an efficient, scalable, general, and robust method for estimating
the states of features in an environment, both in the present as well as at
arbitrary future times. Through experiments on simulated and real-world data,
we find that Perpetua yields better accuracy than similar approaches while also
being online adaptable and robust to missing observations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于松弛总广义变分正则化的分段平滑Mumford-Shah模型，用于网格分割，优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Mumford-Shah模型追求最短边界，但无法处理不规则结构。新模型通过分段平滑假设和rTGV正则化改进分割效果。

Method: 结合分段常数函数和平滑函数，利用rTGV正则化捕捉高阶不连续性，采用交替最小化和ADMM求解。

Result: 在Princeton分割基准测试中表现优异，边界更优且计算高效。

Conclusion: 新模型在分割不规则结构网格时更有效，且计算成本低，具有竞争力。

Abstract: The Mumford-Shah (MS) model is an important technique for mesh segmentation.
Many existing researches focus on piecewise constant MS mesh segmentation model
with total variation regularization, which pursue the shortest length of
boundaries. Different from previous efforts, in this article, we propose a
novel piecewise smooth MS mesh segmentation model by utilizing the relaxed
total generalized variation regularization (rTGV). The new model assumes that
the feature function of a mesh can be approximated by the sum of piecewise
constant function and asmooth function, and the rTGV regularization is able to
characterize the high order discontinuity of the geometric structure. The newly
introduced method is effective in segmenting meshes with irregular structures
and getting the better boundaries rather than the shortest boundaries. We solve
the new model by alternating minimization and alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM). Our algorithm is discussed from several aspects, and
comparisons with several state-of-art methods. Experimental results show that
our method can yield competitive results when compared to other approaches. In
addition, our results compare favorably to those of the several state-of-art
techniques when evaluated on the Princeton Segmentation Benchmark. Furthermore,
the quantitative errors and computational costs confirm the robustness and
efficiency of the proposed method.

TL;DR: 提出了一种从无标签数据集中挖掘视觉元素关联的方法，生成高质量创意标题，并创建了一个新数据集。实验表明，该方法在创意领域（如诗歌和隐喻可视化）的零样本检索中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型依赖简短、字面的网络数据，缺乏对创意输出的理解能力。

Method: 从无标签数据集中挖掘视觉元素的上下文关联，生成不同抽象程度的创意标题。

Result: 创建了包含170万创意标题的新数据集，人类评估显示标题既视觉相关又具抽象性。在诗歌和隐喻可视化领域的零样本检索中表现提升。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效提升视觉语言模型在创意领域的表现，并公开了数据集和模型供社区使用。

Abstract: Understanding another person's creative output requires a shared language of
association. However, when training vision-language models such as CLIP, we
rely on web-scraped datasets containing short, predominantly literal, alt-text.
In this work, we introduce a method for mining contextualized associations for
salient visual elements in an image that can scale to any unlabeled dataset.
Given an image, we can use these mined associations to generate high quality
creative captions at increasing degrees of abstraction. With our method, we
produce a new dataset of visual associations and 1.7m creative captions for the
images in MSCOCO. Human evaluation confirms that these captions remain visually
grounded while exhibiting recognizably increasing abstraction. Moreover,
fine-tuning a visual encoder on this dataset yields meaningful improvements in
zero-shot image-text retrieval in two creative domains: poetry and metaphor
visualization. We release our dataset, our generation code and our models for
use by the broader community.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散模型的分段引导框架，用于解决逆问题，平衡计算效率与准确性，适用于多种任务且无需重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在生成高维数据时表现出色，但现有方法在解决逆问题时通常需要针对特定任务重新训练，且计算效率不高。本文旨在提出一种通用的、高效的解决方案。

Method: 引入分段引导机制，根据扩散时间步长定义引导项，分别在高噪声和低噪声阶段采用不同近似方法，同时显式地考虑测量噪声。

Result: 在图像修复任务（如修复和超分辨率）中，相比基线方法，推理时间减少25%（修复）和23-24%（超分辨率），且PSNR和SSIM损失可忽略。

Conclusion: 该框架在计算效率和准确性之间取得了良好平衡，适用于多种逆问题，且无需任务特定调整。

Abstract: Diffusion models are powerful tools for sampling from high-dimensional
distributions by progressively transforming pure noise into structured data
through a denoising process. When equipped with a guidance mechanism, these
models can also generate samples from conditional distributions. In this paper,
a novel diffusion-based framework is introduced for solving inverse problems
using a piecewise guidance scheme. The guidance term is defined as a piecewise
function of the diffusion timestep, facilitating the use of different
approximations during high-noise and low-noise phases. This design is shown to
effectively balance computational efficiency with the accuracy of the guidance
term. Unlike task-specific approaches that require retraining for each problem,
the proposed method is problem-agnostic and readily adaptable to a variety of
inverse problems. Additionally, it explicitly incorporates measurement noise
into the reconstruction process. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is
demonstrated through extensive experiments on image restoration tasks,
specifically image inpainting and super-resolution. Using a class conditional
diffusion model for recovery, compared to the \pgdm baseline, the proposed
framework achieves a reduction in inference time of \(25\%\) for inpainting
with both random and center masks, and \(23\%\) and \(24\%\) for \(4\times\)
and \(8\times\) super-resolution tasks, respectively, while incurring only
negligible loss in PSNR and SSIM.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效识别最佳探测层，提升概念探测性能。

Abstract: Concept probing has recently gained popularity as a way for humans to peek
into what is encoded within artificial neural networks. In concept probing,
additional classifiers are trained to map the internal representations of a
model into human-defined concepts of interest. However, the performance of
these probes is highly dependent on the internal representations they probe
from, making identifying the appropriate layer to probe an essential task. In
this paper, we propose a method to automatically identify which layer's
representations in a neural network model should be considered when probing for
a given human-defined concept of interest, based on how informative and regular
the representations are with respect to the concept. We validate our findings
through an exhaustive empirical analysis over different neural network models
and datasets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于模拟的IR drop预测方法计算成本高且难以扩展，而现有学习方法未能充分利用输入特征通道的差异性。

Method: 将IR drop预测重新定义为像素级回归任务，并提出WACA机制，通过两阶段门控策略增强弱特征通道并抑制过强通道，结合ConvNeXtV2-based attention U-Net实现自适应特征表示。

Result: 在ICCAD-2023基准测试中，该方法将平均绝对误差降低了61.1%，F1分数提高了71.0%，优于竞赛优胜者。

Conclusion: 通道异质性是VLSI物理布局分析中的关键归纳偏差，WACA机制有效提升了预测性能。

Abstract: Accurate spatial prediction of power integrity issues, such as IR drop, is
critical for reliable VLSI design. However, traditional simulation-based
solvers are computationally expensive and difficult to scale. We address this
challenge by reformulating IR drop estimation as a pixel-wise regression task
on heterogeneous multi-channel physical maps derived from circuit layouts.
Prior learning-based methods treat all input layers (e.g., metal, via, and
current maps) equally, ignoring their varying importance to prediction
accuracy. To tackle this, we propose a novel Weakness-Aware Channel Attention
(WACA) mechanism, which recursively enhances weak feature channels while
suppressing over-dominant ones through a two-stage gating strategy. Integrated
into a ConvNeXtV2-based attention U-Net, our approach enables adaptive and
balanced feature representation. On the public ICCAD-2023 benchmark, our method
outperforms the ICCAD-2023 contest winner by reducing mean absolute error by
61.1% and improving F1-score by 71.0%. These results demonstrate that
channel-wise heterogeneity is a key inductive bias in physical layout analysis
for VLSI.

Motivation: 现有语音驱动面部生成方法依赖固定语音，限制了应用（如面部-语音不匹配），因此扩展任务至更具挑战性的设置。

Method: 提出Face2VoiceSync框架，包括语音-面部对齐、多样性控制、高效训练和新评估指标。

Result: 实验表明Face2VoiceSync在视觉和音频性能上均达到最先进水平，仅需单块40GB GPU。

Conclusion: Face2VoiceSync成功解决了语音-面部生成中的关键问题，并展示了高效和多样性控制的优势。

Abstract: Recent studies in speech-driven talking face generation achieve promising
results, but their reliance on fixed-driven speech limits further applications
(e.g., face-voice mismatch). Thus, we extend the task to a more challenging
setting: given a face image and text to speak, generating both talking face
animation and its corresponding speeches. Accordingly, we propose a novel
framework, Face2VoiceSync, with several novel contributions: 1) Voice-Face
Alignment, ensuring generated voices match facial appearance; 2) Diversity \&
Manipulation, enabling generated voice control over paralinguistic features
space; 3) Efficient Training, using a lightweight VAE to bridge visual and
audio large-pretrained models, with significantly fewer trainable parameters
than existing methods; 4) New Evaluation Metric, fairly assessing the diversity
and identity consistency. Experiments show Face2VoiceSync achieves both visual
and audio state-of-the-art performances on a single 40GB GPU.

Motivation: 研究人类是否能有效区分真实与AI生成的图像，以应对AI生成内容可能带来的虚假信息风险。

Method: 通过在线游戏收集数据，参与者对随机展示的真实和AI生成图像进行真实性判断。

Conclusion: 需开发透明度工具（如水印和AI检测工具）以减少AI生成内容带来的虚假信息风险。

Abstract: As AI-powered image generation improves, a key question is how well human
beings can differentiate between "real" and AI-generated or modified images.
Using data collected from the online game "Real or Not Quiz.", this study
investigates how effectively people can distinguish AI-generated images from
real ones. Participants viewed a randomized set of real and AI-generated
images, aiming to identify their authenticity. Analysis of approximately
287,000 image evaluations by over 12,500 global participants revealed an
overall success rate of only 62\%, indicating a modest ability, slightly above
chance. Participants were most accurate with human portraits but struggled
significantly with natural and urban landscapes. These results highlight the
inherent challenge humans face in distinguishing AI-generated visual content,
particularly images without obvious artifacts or stylistic cues. This study
stresses the need for transparency tools, such as watermarks and robust AI
detection tools to mitigate the risks of misinformation arising from
AI-generated content
